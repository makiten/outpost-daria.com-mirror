<p>Chapter 12 - Equal and Opposite Reactions</p>


<p><i>(The Morgendorffer's residence, about 15 minutes later)</i></p>



     <p>Darren came up the the front door, full of <i>anxiety</i>. What would he say <i>now</i>? How would his birth family <i>react</i> to his disclosure that he <i>liked</i> Jane, and she <i>him</i>? He visualized the anticipated reactions--a <i>stunned</i> Helen and Jake asking questions, like, <i>"Why Jane? Doesn't she like <b>Tom</b>?" Quinn</i>--Darren could only imagine her <i>anger</i> and <i>disgust</i>--something like, <i>"EWWWW--how could you like a <b>loser</b> like Jane?"</i>, or, <i>"How could you do <b>this</b> to <b>me</b>?"</i>, or, <i>"Now I can <b>never</b> show my face in the Fashion Club again!"</i> He chuckled quietly at <i>that</i> thought.</p>

     <P>Then there was <I>Daria</I>--Darren had told her that he couldn't <I>possibly</I> do anything with Jane--she was Daria's best friend, the same for Jane saying Darren was Daria's brother. <I>What a classic case of <B>self-denial</B>, old boy</I>. What would <I>she</I> say about him and Jane seeing each other? Darren sighed--this was <I>not</I> going to go well no matter <I>how</I> he put it to the Morgendorffers. At least there was one <I>good</I> thing about all of this--Darren telling his birth family about Jane would be a good <I>test case</I> for seeing their <I>"reactions"</I> prior to his telling them later that his last name isn't <I>"Coverton"</I>, but <I>"Appleton"</I>. Of course, he couldn't <I>do</I> that until this "Sanchez" character was caught and could point out <I>who</I> hired him to murder Darren's adopted parents--telling anyone else could <I>drag</I> then into this, and possibly put them in <I>danger</I>. He narrowed his eyes, deep in thought, as something <I>else</I> entered his mind--how would <I>Jane</I> react to his saying he was an Appleton? He suspected that she would be more <I>forgiving</I>, knowing <I>why</I> he had hid saying anything--of course, he couldn't be <I>too</I> sure. For all Darren knew, Jane could <I>side</I> with Daria, and--<I>stop thinking, Darren--get in there and <B>tell</B> them about this <b>sudden</b> thing that's occurred between you and Jane</i>. He rang the doorbell and took a deep breath.</P>

     <P>The door opened, and Daria stood there while holding her pen and pad under her arm, a cup of coffee in her other hand, showing her usual expressionless look, and still dressed in her nightclothes. She stood aside and let Darren by, then followed him into the living room. Darren looked uncomfortably at her--something Daria caught <I>onto</I> almost immediately. She cocked an eyebrow at him, curious.</P>


<P>DARREN: <I>(Sounding uneasy:)</I> Thanks for letting me in, sis. <I>(Looks around:)</I> It's a little after <I>noon--(chuckles:)</i> anyone other than <I>Quinn</I> up yet?</P>

<P>DARIA: No problem. Everybody's still in <I>hibernation</I> as far I can tell--you got in just in time right after the <I>"noon"</I> curfew. <I>(Pauses:)</I> So, what's up, bro? <I>(Smirks:)</I> You look like you've done something <i>wrong</i> that you feel kind of <I>guilty</I> about--there may be <i>hope</i> for you yet. <I>(Darren gives a lopsided smile at Daria)</I></P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Sighs:)</I> I guess you can kind of say that I <I>am</I> feeling guilty, Daria--<I>(pauses:)</I> I just hope you can <I>understand</I> what I'm about to tell you, because I guess I'm <I>still</I> trying to understand it myself.</P>

<P>DARIA: Ah, now you've gotten me <I>intrigued--(pauses:) hold it</I>--you just came from <I>Jane's</I>. Does your feeling <I>"guilty"</I> have <I>something</I> to do with <I>her</I>? <I>(Darren gives a slow nod, and Daria sighs:)</I> Hey, don't tell me that after your talk with her you're <I>still</I> feeling like that kiss was <I>your</I> fault. I kind of thought from your call to me this morning that you two were <I>past</I> that.</P> 

<P>DARREN: <I>(Looks for words:)</I> Well--uh, Daria--Jane and I--<I>didn't</I> get past the kissing incident. <I>(Daria raises her eyebrows in surprise:)</I> In fact, <I>(chuckles uneasily:)</I> we kind of--well--uh--<I>(voice gets very low, looks away, talks quickly:)</I> did some <I>more</I> of it.</P>


     <P>Daria looked <I>stunned</I>--or as stunned as Daria could get if one could tell. Did she <I>just</I> hear her brother say--<I>nah</I>--she must have <I>misheard</I> him, that's it--<I>got</I> to be.</P>


<P>DARIA: <I>(Slight smirk:)</I> Hmm--you <I>almost</I> had me there, bro. <I>(Darren frowns slightly at Daria, perplexed)</I> For a second there, I thought I heard you say that you and Jane kissed <I>again</I>. Nice <I>joke</I>.</P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Now looking and sounding completely sincere, totally serious:)</I> Daria--I'm <I>quite</I> serious. Jane and I, well, <I>did</I> kiss each other <I>again</I>, and we're kind of--<I>attracted</I> to one another. There, I <I>said</I> it. <I>(Daria's eyes light up)</I></P>


     <P>Daria was about to say something when there was a collective <I>gasp</I> from behind them the very next instant, and Daria and Darren turned around. At the foot of the stairs in their nightclothes, <I>Helen, Jake,</I> and <I>Quinn</I> looked at both of them, <I>completely wide-eyed</I>, with their mouths <I>agape</I>, and were <I>flabbergasted</I>.</P>



<P><I>(Scene changes to the Appleton Towers, the same time, in William Appleton's office)</I></P>



     <P>Called in for a "special" Sunday meeting, <I>Constance Waters</I> stood in the middle of William's office with her arms crossed, her face a mask of <I>fury</I>. William Appleton, who was sitting behind his desk, leaned back in his chair with his hands in a prayer-like position up to his chin, looking at her calmly. On his right side, Benny was giving her a neutral look. On William's left side was a nervous-looking Sam Norwood.</P>


<P>CONSTANCE: <I>(Frowns:)</I> What in the <I>hell</I> do you mean, <I>"You're needed in Japan?"</I> I thought we were going to get someone <I>else</I> to head our operations concerning our share of Tsunama/Fuju!</P> 

<P>WILLIAM: <I>(Cocks a <B>menacing</B> eyebrow for a second, then faux smiles:)</I> Now, calm down, Constance--after careful consideration on my part, and since you're the one who <I>spearheaded</I> this fabulous deal, I thought you'd <I>jump</I> at the chance to to go there! After all, no one <I>else</I> is available--</P>

<P>CONSTANCE: <I>(Widens her eyes in disbelief, cuts him off:)</i> --What do you <i>mean, "No one else is available"</i>? How about <i>(counts on her fingers:) Wild? Forman? Berry? Hass? Bronstein? That Bob what's-his-name? Neilson?</i> Don't you <i>dare</i> tell me that <i>Long</i> or <i>Takis</i> is unavailable--and I know for a <i>fact</i> that either <i>Kilner</i> or <i>Fox</i>, or even <i>Marley</i>, and that--that--<i>"paperpusher", Rich</i>--</p>

<p>WILLIAM:<I> (Now cuts her off, rises out of his seat, glares:) --Enough</I>, Constance! If you <I>can't</I> do the <I>job</I>--</P>

<P>CONSTANCE: <I>(Narrows her eyes and clenches her teeth, <B>slams</B> her hand on the desk, which causes everyone but William to jump:)</I> --Oh, <I>no</I> you don't--that <I>"job"</I> line <I>won't</I> work <I>here</I>! I did my <I>"job"</I> with selling the nuclear plants, and then went <I>way</I> beyond <I>that</I> with Tsumana/Fuju! I've gotten entirely too much work <I>here</I> to simply drop and go over to Japan to oversee those operations! <I>(Pauses, realizes:)</I> You've become <I>brazen</I> in trying to get <I>rid</I> of me, even if you know that the Board might <I>do</I> something if you try, haven't you, William? I heard through the <I>grapevine</I> that I represent something of a <I>"threat"</I> to your Chairmanship like <I>Potter</I> did--only <I>worse--(sneers:) right</I>?</P>


     <P>William's eyes grew <I>extremely</I> big, clenched <I>his</I> teeth, and he gave a glare that could've <I>obliterated</I> a <I>planet</I> to Constance, who suddenly had the feeling that she had just said the <I>wrongest possible thing</I>. Both Benny and Sam cut their eyes at William, privately <I>terrified</I>. The tension in the air became almost <I>unbearable</I> for a moment, then William spoke while slowly leaning on his desk by his hands, still standing, and pointedly looking at Constance, smirking <I>wickedly</I>.</P>


<P>WILLIAM: <I>(In a dark tone:)</I> Think what you <I>want</I>, Constance--it makes no <I>damn</I> difference to me one way or the other. The fact of the matter is, is that <I>I'm</I> the Chairman, and I'm in a <I>good</I> position to present my reasons to send you to Japan to the Board, and you <I>don't</I>. Go to the <I>Board</I>. Go to our <I>shareholders</I>. You have the <I>right</I> to do whatever you think is best. <I>(Pauses, then his voice takes on an even <B>darker</B> tone, now with no expression on his face:)</I> But make <I>no</I> mistake, my dear--if you <I>"think"</I> that you can take <I>my</I> position, then I'd suggest that that is <I>all</I> you <I>can</I> do about it--<I>"think"</I>. Do not <I>delude</I> yourself as to assume that <I>I'll</I> go <I>"gentle into that good night"</I>, because if you <I>ever</I> do, that will be your <I>first</I>--if not your <I>last</I> mistake--<I>count</I> on it.</P>


     <P>Constance looked at William, stunned. Did he just <I>threaten</I> to--? She glanced at Benny Lodell, who simply kept a <I>poker</I> face while looking at her, and at Sam Norwood, who was sneaking a peek at the <I>ceiling</I> nervously. She thought carefully for a second before she spoke her next words, not entirely sure if William actually <I>was</I> serious.</P> 


<P>CONSTANCE: <I>(Keeping up a brave front:)</I> I-I <I>never</I> said that I <I>wanted</I> the Chairmanship that you have, William--there's no need for <I>threats</I> from you--</P>

<P>WILLIAM: <I>(Cuts her off, slightly lessening his dark tone, still with the expressionless face:)</I> --Or <I>you</I>, Constance. We're a <I>team</I> here, and if you're not with the <I>program</I>, then you're in the <I>way. (Narrows his eyes:) Are</I> you going to help or <I>hinder</I> us by <I>challenging</I> my authority? <I>I</I> am your <I>superior</I>, and you are my <I>subordinate. (Pauses:)</I> The choice is <I>yours</I>.</P>


     <P>Constance <i>swallowed</i> the rage she felt, and decided that the <i>professional</i> thing to do was to wait for William to dig his <i>own</i> grave--something she figured that <i>Leonard Potter</i> was waiting for William to do while in Los Angeles. She guessed that she <i>could</i> win this dispute if she brought it up <i>before</i> the Board of Directors, but it could be a <i>costly</i> one, for a <i>strong</i> possibility existed that there would then be a <i>split</i> within the ranks (Constance had <i>much</i> support in the conglomerate and on the Board--<i>almost</i> as much as William himself, thanks to Tsunama/Fuju), and it was possible that lingering <i>bitterness</i> could erupt from any possible <i>infighting</i> that could occur, thus possibly <i>hurting</i> the company--and <i>morale</i> as well, not to mention the <i>negative</i> publicity that could do <i>damage</i> to the conclomerate concerning the stock market, and its shareholders. She suspected that William <i>knew</i> this--that she <i>was</i> a team player, and would not upset the goal in mind. <i><b>Shrewd</b> move, William, appealing to my sense of <b>teamwork</b> like that--you win--for <b>now</b></i>.</p>


<p>CONSTANCE: <i>(After pondering, sighs, speaks in a low, resigned tone:)</i> Very well, William--I'll pack, and <i>leave</i> as soon as possible.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Grins, triumphant:) Excellent</i>, Constance--you have <i>two</i> days to pack. I'll contact <i>Brault</i> and <i>Williams</i> to share in the workload in taking care of your energy position, and I'll get <i>Grenier</i> and <i>Morgan</i> to fill in <i>their</i> positions. <i>(Walks around the desk still grinning, puts his arm around Constance's shoulder, something that momentarily <b>frightens</b> her for some reason, and leads her to the door:)</i> Call me when you're packed, and we'll go over the final paperwork with <i>Yee</i> and <i>Daoren</i> when you leave, okay? <i>(Pauses, gently but firmly turns Constance to face him, looks down at her directly in the eyes, smirks coldly:)</i> Now, I'm going to <i>assume</i> that if anyone asks about <i>why</i> you're going to move to Japan, that you'll tell them you decided of your own <i>volition</i> to go and <i>personally</i> oversee our operations in Tsumana/Fuju--no need to let everyone <i>think</i> that you're going over there because I <i>"pressured"</i> you to, right?</p>

<p>CONSTANCE: <i>(After giving a quick, unreadable glare at William, in a curt response:) No</i>, of course not, William. If anyone asks, I'll tell them that I'm going because the company--<i>(hesitates:) needs</i> me over there.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Gives a cold grin, squeezes Constance's shoulder:) Spendid</i>! <i>(Opens door:)</i> Goodbye, my dear--<i>enjoy</i> your trip!</p>

<p>CONSTANCE: <i>(While walking out, in a cold tone:) William. (William shuts the door behind her)</i></p>


     <p>William went back to his desk and sat down expressionessly. Sam Norwood had formed a big <i>grin</i> on his face, astounded, and spoke.</p>


<p>NORWOOD: Boss, that was--was--<i>incredible</i>! You sure put that Waters <i>witch</i> in her <i>place</i>, and--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Cuts him off, frowns:)</i> --Have you found any legal <i>loopholes</i> that will give me the Chairmanship of Appleton Industries free and clear as of <i>yet</i>, Sam?</p>

<p>NORWOOD: <i>(Now looks foolish, stutters:)</i> W-well, uh, I'm <i>s-still</i> looking, Boss. I haven't f-found anything yet, but--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Now snarls:) --THEN DON'T YOU THINK YOU OUGHT TO KEEP LOOKING UNTIL YOU <b>DO</b>, YOU NITWIT</i>?! <i>(Norwood <b>cowers</b>, and rushes out of the office, slams the door behind him in his haste)</i></p>


     <p>Benny <i>gulped</i> as William turned slowly to him.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Narrows his eyes:)</i> Is everything set with the <i>Woo</i> situation, Benny?</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Fights back his nervousness:)</i> Y-yeah, Boss--our man told me yesterday that he <i>sucessfully</i> planted that <i>super-sensitive</i> bug in the reception area of Woo's office. He's reported that <i>no</i> one has come in this morning, and that Woo and the people that work for him probably won't until tomorrow. He has a <i>monitoring system</i> in his car, and is currently <i>right</i> outside of Woo's office, <i>(pauses, looks terrified when William glares at him:)</i> I-I <i>mean</i>, on the <i>next</i> street over, Boss--listening in.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Now looks off into space:)</i> Tell him to stay <i>all</i> day today, Benny--I want to keep a <i>constant</i> watch on him and his men--no need to take <i>any</i> chances that someone might come in and we <i>miss</i> anything, eh? <i>(Benny nods)</i> Good. <i>(Rocks back and forth in his chair:)</i> Now, we've got to locate <i>Sanchez</i>--<i>(cocks an eyebrow:)</i> anything on <i>that</i> yet, Benny?</p>

<p>BENNY: Nothing yet, Boss--it's almost as if he's <i>vanished</i> into thin air, or something. After he had called me about the second part of the payment pending the results of the NTSB findings, I thought for <i>sure</i> he'd call back by now. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I guess he's not taking any chances on someone connecting <i>him</i> to the crash, eh, Boss?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: As he damn well better <i>not</i> do, Benny--still, best not take <i>anything</i> for granted. The <i>next</i> time he calls, I want to know immediately <i>where</i> he is. That way, we can keep an <i>eye</i> on him in case he tries something <i>funny</i>.</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> You <i>really</i> think Sanchez could <i>double-cross</i> us, Boss? I mean, wouldn't <i>he</i> be in as much trouble as <i>we'd</i> be if he were caught?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Sighs--gives a <b>"Benny's not getting it again"</b> look:)</i> Benny, if for <i>some</i> reason Sanchez is somehow or another discovered by the police to have a hand in what happened to my dear brother and sister-in-law, he could turn <i>state's evidence</i> against us, and make a deal with the district attorney, getting some sort of immunity agreement, or getting little time in jail, and putting <i>our</i> fat in the fire. Also, remember that Sanchez was arrested for <i>extortion--(glares at Benny as if he wants to say something else, but decides not to:)</i> as one of his many--<i>violations</i>. He could try and extort <i>more</i> money from us--<i>(narrows his eyes:)</i> not that he'd <i>ever</i> even <i>dare</i> try to do something as <i>stupid</i> as that--I just want to make <i>sure</i> that he's under <i>wraps. (Grins wickedly:)</i> Of course, we might have to get <i>rid</i> of him <i>anyway</i> if he becomes a--<i>problem. (Looks out of the window)</i></p>

<p>BENNY: Boss, with Constance gone for awhile, wouldn't that just leave--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(While still looking out:) --Outside</i> of finding Sanchez, my <i>"nephew"</i> to possibly stand in my way? Here is where Sam Norwood had <i>better</i> find something to get Darren <i>out</i> of the way, legally if possible--if not, I'm going to have to--<i>force</i> the issue with my <i>"so-called"</i> nephew, <i>especially</i> if he's involved in trying to discover if <i>I</i> was the one who ordered his <i>"parents"</i> deaths. <i>(Cuts his eyes over to Benny:)</i> Is that man that I wanted on <i>standby</i> to spy on Darren ready to go at a moment's notice?</p>

<p>BENNY: Yeah, Boss--just give the <i>word</i>, and he'll go <i>immediately</i> to this <i>"Lawndale"</i> place.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Resumes looking out over the city:)</i> Good--still, I don't want him to just sit around and <i>twiddle</i> his thumbs while we waste money on paying him--tell him to get some <i>information</i> on these Morgend<i>weefers</i>, you know, just call someone--</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Releuctantly interrupts William:)</i> --Er, Boss--I--think its Morgend<i>OFFERS</i>--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Casts a quick, <b>vicious</b> glare at a now-slightly cowering Benny, talks through clenched teeth:) --Morgendorffers</i>, Benny--<i>(resumes his normal voice:)</i> like where they <i>work</i> and <i>live</i> in this <i>"Lawndale"</i> place. We know that Darren's birth mother is a <i>lawyer</i>, and his birth father is a <i>marketing consultant</i>, or something. <i>(Pauses:)</i> See if our man can find out anything on Darren's <i>sisters</i> as well--we might need them <i>all</i> as some sort of--<i>"insurance"</i> in dealing with my <i>"nephew".</i></p> 

<p>BENNY: Okay, Boss. <i>(Leaves the office)</i></p>
 


<p><i>(Scene is back at the Morgendorffers, the same time)</i></p>



     <p>Darren had just told everyone of Jane's kiss in the Zen, (After all, he couldn't deny it <i>now</i>, could he?) and why she had done it, and the events of the morning that led up to both he and Jane kissing each other <i>again</i>. (Including finally, the death of his fiancee, Stephanie Reardon.) After the initial shock and expressions of condolences from Helen, Jake, and Quinn over Stephanie, (Daria had wisely said <i>nothing</i> about Darren telling her earlier, so as not to give the others the impression that Darren had <i>"favored"</i> Daria over them by confining his secret pain to her first) Darren's guesses about what would happen when Helen, Jake, and Quinn found out about Jane were <i>largely</i> true, as Helen was pacing back and forth in the living room <i>along</i> with an equally-worried Quinn, and Jake standing off to the side with a <i>nervous</i> look on his face, more than likely because of Jake's <i>fears</i> over how Helen would react. Daria had sat down beside Darren on the middle couch while all of this was going on, and simply watched her mother and sister with her usual <i>"expressionless expression"</i>, and had not said a word--Darren couldn't tell from Daria's reaction about his liking Jane--as <i>if</i>. He then watched his birth mother and sister with an <i>intrigued</i> expression as they paced. Helen, (as well as Quinn) had stopped, and looked at Darren with an expression of disbelief, then spoke.</p>


<p>HELEN: Darren--<i>(hesitates:)</i> are you <i>sure</i> about Jane? (<i>Daria</i>, not Darren, cocks an eyebrow as if asking, <i>"What's the matter with Jane?"</i>) I mean, I--<i>(looks at Jake:)</i> that is <i>we</i> know that she's a <i>good</i> girl, but how do you know that this isn't just a--<i>(looks for words:) physical</i> attraction between the two of you? <i>(Darren sighs)</i></p> 

<p>DARREN: To be honest with you, speaking for myself, <i>(pauses:)</i> I really don't know <i>what</i> it is--and don't <i>all</i> relationships <i>start</i> with a physical attraction? Didn't you two <i>(motions to Helen and Jake:)</i> first become attracted to each other physically? <i>(Helen and Jake look at each other, blushing for a moment)</i> I just think that Jane is <i>good</i> people, that's all. Yes, I know she <i>was</i> with Tom, but from what she told me, their relationship was basically <i>over</i> for <i>awhile</i>.</p> 

<p>QUINN: <i>(Rolls her eyes:) Daaaarren! Believe</i> me when I say that if a girl <i>drops</i> a guy and picks up <i>another</i> one right after, <i>(snaps her fingers:)</i> just like <i>that</i>, it goes <i>up in smoke</i>--pure and simple!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> And <i>you</i> ought to know about that <i>"up in smoke"</i> type of relationship, shouldn't you, Quinn? You do it <i>all</i> the time, right? <i>(Quinn gives Daria the glare to end all glares)</i> Oh--that's right--make that <i>"did"</i>--you can't right now because of the "Big Bro" <i>factor</i> around here after the word got out about your <i>"admirers"</i> getting their <i>asses</i> kicked by Darren. <i>(Sneers:)</i> You just can't stay in <i>"practice"</i> at the moment, can you?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Points at Daria:)</i> Hey! It's not <i>my</i> fault that you didn't <i>tell</i> Jane that Darren <i>knew</i> martial arts! <i>(Daria glares at Quinn's comeback, while Darren looks up and sighs)</i></p> 

<p>HELEN: <i>(Narrows her eyes:)</i> Daria, Quinn, that's enough! Darren, <i>all</i> I'm saying is, well, are you sure that Jane doesn't <i>remind</i> you in some way of--well--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gives a slight frown, cuts Helen off, stands up:) --Stephanie</i>? Is <i>that</i> what you were going to say? Look, let's get something <i>straight</i>--I <i>have</i> to get on with my life--I've been in <i>mourning</i> for about two months. If you all think that I'm attracted to Jane as some sort of--<i>"remedy"</i> to get <i>over</i> Stephanie--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Rushes forward, gently puts her hands on Darren's chest:)</i> --No, no, that's <i>not</i> it, son--of <i>course</i> you should get on with your life! We're just--<i>concerned</i> over your--<i>"sudden"</i> interest in her, that's all! <i>(Looks over at Jake, who has sat down on the right couch and is reading the Sunday paper:) JAKE</i>! Put down that <i>damn</i> paper and get up and come the <i>hell</i> over here and <i>help</i> me!</p>


     <p>Jake threw the paper aside, jumped up, and came over to Helen and Darren.</p>


<p>JAKE: Uh, well--<i>(looks over at a glaring Helen:)</i> maybe, well--maybe Darren's <i>right</i>, dear. <i>(Adds hastily before a shocked Helen can say something:)</i> You know, he and Jane are <i>grown, responsible, mature</i> young adults. I mean, if they want to get together, then, well, that's <i>their</i> business, ya know? <i>(Pauses, looks confused for a moment:)</i> Is that <i>right</i>, Helen?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles at Jake:)</i> Hey, thanks for your support. <i>(Daria smirks, for she knows what is going to happen next)</i></p>


     <p>Helen gasped in shock and anger, her eyes grew as big as <i>silver dollars</i>, clenched her teeth, and she grabbed the cup of the half-filled, now-cold coffee that Daria had put on the (named appropiately enough) coffee table, and promptly <i>poured</i> it over Jake's head. Helen then stormed upstairs. Quinn glared at Darren for a moment, shook her head in disgust, then followed Helen upstairs. Darren watched them both go, stunned.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks between the soaked Jake and Daria, lost:)</i> I didn't--I mean--that is--did she--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sighs:) Relax</i>, bro--mom gets like that <i>sometimes. (Darren's eyes and mouth grow even <b>wider</b> from shock)</i> I remember that something like that happened <i>before</i>--she'll calm down and apologize later. <i>(Looks over at Jake, who looks down, embarassed:)</i> C'mon, Dad--lets go in the kitchen and get you cleaned up. <i>(Pulls Jake into the kitchen, followed by Darren)</i></p>

<p><i>(Note to reader: Helen got like that with Jake in the episode "Arts 'N Crass" with the "penne a la pasto", remember?)</i></p>


<p><i>(Scene shifts to the Lane's at the same time)</i></p>


     <p>Jane sat on her bed in her room, having showered and changed into her regular clothes, and now was talking with a <i>fully-awake</i> Trent (unbelievable as <i>that</i> was), who was sitting beside her. She had told him about her conversation with Tom the previous night, and the one earlier this morning with Darren--culminating with their <i>second</i> kiss in the Lane's living room. Trent took in every word, at first surprised, then pondered for a moment, and spoke.</p>


<p>TRENT: Whoa, Janey--what did <i>mom</i> say about this when you told her?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Sighs, rolls her eyes:)</i> While she was <i>rushing</i> out of the door to that damn <i>"Art In Pottery"</i> show? <i>(Pauses, frowns to herself, surprised:)</i> Hell, I can't <i>believe</i> that I just used the word <i>"damn"</i> with <i>"art". (Shakes her head slowly while shutting her eyes:)</i> Geez, this whole situation must be <i>affecting</i> me more than I thought. Anyway, she said in her own soothing voice: <i>(imitating her mom:) "Whatever calms your inner soul, Jane"</i>, then she <i>blew</i> outta here like a bat outta hell. <i>(Looks uneasily at Trent after a moment:) Never</i> mind about mom--what do <i>you</i> think about all of this, Trent?</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Hey, it's <i>cool</i>, Janey--I liked Tom, and still do, but Darren's okay, too. I'm not exactly an <i>"expert"</i> when it comes to relationships--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks, thought v.o.: <b>Tell</b> me about it, Mr.<b>"Get-with-Monique-one-week-then-dump-one-another-the-next-week"</b> Lane.)</i></p>

<p>TRENT: --but I think if you <i>really</i> like Darren, and he you, then <i>go</i> for it. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Do you know how <i>Daria's</i> gonna <i>react</i> to you liking her brother?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Frowns slightly at <b>that</b> thought:)</i> I dunno--Darren said that he'd tell Daria and her family when he left here this morning. I'm waiting a little while before I go over there myself to face the <i>music--(smirks:)</i> no pun intended, bro. <i>(Trent smirks back, then Jane adds after a moment:)</i> I wanted to go <i>with</i> him, but he <i>insisted</i> that he wanted to <i>prepare</i> them for me--it doesn't seem right for him to take his family's <i>grief</i> for me--God <i>knows</i> he did <i>more</i> than enough for me over that sinkhole. <i>(Looks down, depressed, and Trent puts a reassuring hand on Jane's shoulder)</i></p>

<p>TRENT: C'mon, Janey--<i>(arches an eyebrow:)</i> you don't think Daria's gonna be <i>upset</i> or something, do you? She's your <i>best</i> friend.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Cuts her eyes to Trent:)</i> Trent, I'm <i>not</i> worried too much about <i>Daria</i>--it's her <i>family</i> that has me nervous. <i>(Snorts:)</i> I can see <i>Quinn</i> now, worrying about her <i>"reputation"</i> being <i>"ruined"</i> by me seeing her brother, or <i>Helen</i> just <i>screaming</i> about how I might be a <i>"bad"</i> influence on her son, or something. As for <i>Jake</i>--well, I can only say he'd probably go <i>with</i> what Helen says--I hate to say it, but the man has <i>little</i> backbone in standing up to her, bless his <i>weak</i> little heart--<i>(thinks about Jake's minor heart attack that he had:)</i> oops, <i>wrong</i> choice of words, there--sorry.</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Sighs, then:)</i> Janey, I think you're being too <i>hard</i> on Mr. and Mrs. M--<i>(narrows his eyes:)</i> though I can see <i>"Daria's Sister"</i> being PO'd, but she <i>doesn't</i> count, at least to <i>me</i>. Even if they <i>do</i> have some reservations about your seeing Darren, they really <i>can't</i> stop you two from doing so, you know? I mean, you guys <i>are</i> grown up and all. Also, you gotta remember he's getting to <i>know</i> his birth family--do you really think that they'd want to push him <i>away</i> now by giving <i>you</i> a <i>hard</i> time? <i>(Shakes his head slowly:)</i> I don't think so.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smiles weakly, shrugs:)</i> Yeah, I guess you're right, bro, but still, I don't wanna get too much on their <i>bad</i> side because I'd like for us to all get along, if you know what I mean, which is why I'm working on a <i>painting</i> for them that I hope will kind of get into their good graces. <i>(Pauses, then reaches over and hugs her brother:)</i> Thanks, Trent--for being there for me--and well--for <i>everything</i>.</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(After hugging his sister, releases her, smiles:)</i> Hey, I'll <i>always</i> be here for you, little sister--you know that. <i>(Stands up with Jane:)</i> Well, I'm gonna take the "new" Tank back to Nick, and he's gonna take me to get my car out of the shop.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:)</i> So, the 'ol blue Plymouth is up and runnin', eh?</p>

<p>TRENT: Yeah. We're gonna go to <i>McGrundy's</i> and practice for our gig there for the first time since we "recovered" for this Friday's show. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Hey, why don't you invite Darren to come with Daria there?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Good idea, bro--I'll ask him and Daria.</p> 

<p>TRENT: <i>(Goes to the doorway, then stops before he leaves, eyebrow cocked:)</i> You <i>sure</i> you're gonna be okay, Janey?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Gives a quiet smile:)</i> I'll be fine, Trent. I'll wait about a few hours, then I'll head over to the Morgendorffer's to await <i>(in a self-mocking dark tone and glare, suddenly standing rigid, like a soldier at attention:) "My day of judgement". (Trent smirks, then leaves, and then Jane drops her playful look, sighs, and goes to her set-up easel, and begins to paint furiously with an <b>intense</b> look on her face)</i></p>


<p><i>(Back to the Morgendorffer's, about an hour-and-a-half later)</i></p>


     <p>Daria, now dressed in her regular ensemble, was typing on her computer keyboard when there was a knock on her door.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Raises her voice slightly:)</i> Is it <i>feeding</i> time yet? If so, I ask you to slide my food <i>under</i> the door--of course, you'll need a damn <i>saw</i> to do the job--</p>

<p>VOICE: <i>(Sounding apologetic, chuckles quietly:)</i> --Funny you should ask about <i>food</i>--I'd like to ask if you can watch <i>me</i> eat some <i>humble pie</i>. May I come in, Daria?</p>

<p>DARIA: Sure, Darren, c'mon in. <i>(Darren enters, dressed in a casual white shirt and kahki pants having just showered)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Hey, sis--<i>(glances at Daria's computer monitor:)</i> what're you writing?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Gives a quick smirk, cuts her eyes at the monitor:)</i> On this <i>outdated, crappy, slow-ass of a hardrive</i> that downloads into <i>next</i> week? It's a short story about a character I call <i>Melody Powers</i>. She's an American <i>secret agent</i>--remind me to tell you about it later. <i>(Pauses:)</i> What's on your mind, bro?</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Thought v.o.: Note to self--make sure Daria gets Appleton's newest <b>top-of-the-line 700 MHz Sharpshooter PC</b> after all of this lunacy is over.)(Sighs:)</i> I think we <i>both</i> know what's on my mind, Daria--<i>Jane. (Daria cocks an eyebrow)</i> You didn't say anything about it yet, so I'm--here to say that I'm <i>sorry</i> for not being <i>honest</i> with you about what I <i>really</i> felt after Jane's kiss, and concerning Jane herself. At the time, I really didn't have a good <i>handle</i> on my feelings--and neither did <i>Jane</i>. I--shouldn't have kept you in the <i>dark</i> about that.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> It's okay, Darren. I figured you'd want to talk to me about it without anybody around, and to be honest with <i>you</i>, I already <i>suspected</i> that you two kind of liked each other <i>already</i>, so it's really <i>none</i> of my business if you and Jane want to see one another.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Ponders for a second:)</i> Daria--I think, and I'm <i>sure</i> Jane thinks as well, that, to a <i>certain</i> extent, it <i>should</i> be your business. <i>(Daria looks at her brother, curious)</i> The <i>last</i> thing either of us wants to do is have you feeling, well, <i>awkward</i> over Jane and me having some sort of relationship--after all, she's your <i>best</i> friend. Neither of us <i>planned</i> to have this happen--it just, well, <i>did. (Frowns to himself, tries to convey his words:)</i> Both of us were kind of <i>"caught up in a crossroad"</i> of our lives--</p>

<p>DARIA: --And where you two ran <i>"smack dab"</i> into each other. <i>(Darren thinks about what happened earlier this morning with running into Jane, and the apparent <b>irony</b> of Daria's words, smirks to himself) (Daria sighs:)</i> Well, I gotta say <i>stranger</i> things have happened. <i>(Pauses, talks in a serious tone:)</i> Look bro--I'm probably <i>biased</i>, but if you gotta like someone, then I can say <i>without</i> a doubt that Jane is the girl I'd <i>want</i> for you to have. <i>(Darren smiles, relieved, while Daria gives a small smirk:)</i> Don't <i>tell</i> her that I said that--she'd <i>never</i> let me live it down.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Laughs:)</i> No problem, sis--she won't hear it from <i>me. (Pauses:)</i> By the way, <i>Helen</i> came by my room and <i>apologized</i> to me for her reaction to Jane, having told me also that she had done the same thing with <i>Jake</i>. She wants to take me out to <i>lunch</i> Wednesday--I'm supposed to come by where she <i>works</i> to pick her up--we'll use my rented car to go and eat, and I can meet her colleagues for the <i>first</i> time--she said they're <i>eager</i> to <i>meet</i> me.</p>

<p>DARIA: Or maybe they'd want to <i>dissect</i> you, and see if they can make you their <i>newest</i> client. <i>(Darren snickers)</i> Hmm--does her apology and subsequent eat-out mean that mom <i>approves</i> of you and Jane?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smirks:)</i> You know, I <i>asked</i> her about that--and she <i>grudgingly</i> said that she won't say anything <i>bad</i> about Jane and me when Jane comes over later. <i>(Adds, shrugs:)</i> At least Helen <i>promised</i> she wouldn't.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Maybe you'd better get that in <i>writing</i>--you know, with mom being a <i>lawyer</i> and everything.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Grins:)</i> The thought <i>had</i> crossed my mind. <i>(Starts to leave:)</i> Well, I'd better talk to <i>Quinn</i> about this--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Narrows her eyes, gets a slight frown on her face:)</i> --Why should you <i>care</i> about what our <i>"beloved sister"</i> thinks, Darren? It's not like she could do <i>much</i> about it, save for <i>moaning</i> and <i>complaining</i> about how it's <i>"ruined her popular reputation"</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Casts an uncertain eye at Daria:)</i> I know I'm <i>reaching</i> here, sis, but I think I can <i>convince</i> Quinn to <i>lay off</i> of Jane--<i>(Daria rolls her eyes)</i> no, <i>really</i>. I believe that just <i>talking</i> to her can do the trick. Wish me luck. <i>(Leaves Daria's room)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Calls after Darren, smirks:)</i> I wish you a whole <i>hell</i> of a lot of luck, bro--a <i>wheelbarrow</i> full of <i>rabbit's feet, horseshoes, and four-leaf clovers</i> of it. <i>(Thought v.o.: My <b>poor, deluded, too nice of a big brother</b>--I wonder how much she'll try to <b>finagle</b> out of him for her silence on Jane? Better remind myself to ask Quinn later.) (Goes back to her computer, sits down, continues to type)</i></p>


     <p>Darren knocked on Quinn's bedroom door. Quinn, also dressed in her familiar clothing, had been reading <i>Waif</i> magazine, was sitting on her bed, and had cut her eyes at the door, frowning.</p> 


<p>DARREN: <i>(Sounding muffled:)</i> Quinn? C'mon, it's Darren. Let me in--I want to talk about Jane.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Rolls her eyes, sneers:) Hmmph</i>! Why <i>should</i> I, bro? You <i>like</i> her, an' that's <i>that</i>! There's <i>nothing</i> I can do about it, except <i>suffer</i> an' stuff! You don't <i>care</i> about <i>my</i> feelings!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Quietly:)</i> Sis, let me in to just talk, okay? I'm getting kind of tired talking to a <i>door. (Pauses:) Please</i>?</p>


     <p>Quinn gave a quick sigh, got off of her bed, opened her door, and let Darren in. She walked past him after shutting the door, and leaped back on her bed, facing Darren, lying on her stomach. Quinn rested on her elbows, and was looking directly at him, still frowning.</p>


<p>QUINN: Shoot--and it had <i>better</i> be good.</p>


     <p>Darren sat down reluctantly on the edge of Quinn's bed, and pondered his next words, quietly speaking.</p>


<p>DARREN: I like Jane, and she likes me, sis--it's as <i>simple</i> as that.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Makes a smacking noise with her mouth, as if in disgust:) God</i>, bro--of <i>all</i> of the girls on the <i>planet</i>, why'd you pick <i>Jane</i>? <i>(Darren frowns at this, something Quinn picks up immediately on, then quickly adds:)</i> Not that Jane is the <i>worse</i> person you can get, by <i>any</i> means. It's just that <i>fashion-wise</i>, I certainly think she can do a <i>lot</i> better--but what is it <i>about</i> her that you like? I mean, with <i>your</i> looks, you can have <i>anybody</i>!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks annoyed, gives a quick sigh:)</i> Thanks for the <i>compliment</i>, but I thought we had gone <i>over</i> this downstairs. I like Jane because she's an attractive, (Quinn rolls her eyes) nice, <i>wickedly</i> funny and decent person. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Look, I'll <i>admit</i> that the kiss she gave me at the Zen kind of--<i>contributed</i> to it, but it was a <i>small</i> contribution. Isn't there <i>some</i> way that you can be <i>nice</i> to her when she comes over later? I'm <i>asking</i> you as my <i>sister</i> to do this for me, your <i>"Big Bro".</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(After a moment, suddenly gets a <b>scheming</b> look on her face:)</i> Hmmmm--are you an' me <i>still</i> gonna go to <i>Chez Pierre</i> tonight, bro?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks at Quinn, a bit perplexed:)</i> Uh--sure, sis--if that's what you <i>still</i> want--what does <i>that</i> have to do with <i>Jane</i>?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Sits up, scoots over to Darren, hooks her arm with his, and gets into her "charm" mode:) Weeeell</i>--I'm gonna need some new <i>clothes</i> to put on for our date--<i>(pauses:)</i> maybe if we can, like stop at <i>Cashman's</i> an' kinda get a <i>few</i> things for me before we go, I can be <i>real</i> nice to Jane. <i>(Goes on quickly before Darren can say anything:)</i> Besides, I haven't had a date with <i>any</i> guy since you <i>beat up</i> Joey, Jeffrey, and Jamie, and I <i>have</i> been really <i>concentratin'</i> an' stuff with you helping me on getting into the Fashion Institute with improving my grades--even though I feel like <i>(ugh) Daria</i>--becomin' a <i>"brain"</i> an' everything. Don't you think you at least owe <i>me</i> for that? <i>(Darren ponders this)</i> After all, as the vice-president of the Fashion Club, I <i>gotta</i> keep up with the <i>latest</i> fashion trends an' everything. <i>(Suddenly gasps, realizes:) Yeah</i>! That's <i>right</i>! <i>(Darren raises an eyebrow, gives Quinn a quick, strange look:) My birthday gift</i>! You can just tell our parents you're getting that stuff as my <i>gift</i>! <i>(Pauses, as Darren now frowns at Quinn, perplexed:)</i> Don't you remember when you an' I <i>first</i> met, bro?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Thinks for a moment:)</i> Yes--yes, I do, Quinn--you thought I worked at <i>Cashman's</i> and had met our parents at the mall to get a <i>"gift"</i> they wanted for you. What does <i>that</i> have to do with--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Cuts Darren off excitedly:)</i> --Don't you <i>see</i>, bro--? <i>(Darren gives a quick shake of his head, still comprehending:)</i> You and I can just say you were getting my <i>birthday</i> gift from <i>Cashman's</i>, you know, just in case our parents ask <i>where</i> I got my stuff from. <i>(Smiles, looks in space:)</i> It's <i>perfect</i>--they <i>can't</i> take it <i>away</i> from me because of <i>that</i>! <i>Mom</i> won't go <i>after</i> me if <i>you</i> tell her!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks at Quinn expressionlessly:)</i> Let me get this <i>straight</i>--you want me to <i>bribe</i> you into liking Jane by buying you some clothes at <i>Cashman's</i>, and then say to our parents that the clothes are your <i>birthday gift</i> so they won't be able to take your clothes away if they find out, thinking that you took <i>advantage</i> of me?</p> 

<p>QUINN: <i>(Nods and shrugs:)</i> It's like when I <i>thought</i> Daria had taken advantage of you, you know, <i>blackmailing</i> you when you sided with <i>her</i> an' told the Fashion Club I was <i>your</i> cousin? <i>(Quickly adds:)</i> Not that I'm holding that <i>against</i> you, bro--it's <i>history</i>, really. Besides, everything's <i>legal</i> an' on the level--it <i>will</i> be my birthday next month. <i>(Pauses, smirks:)</i> So, what do you <i>think</i>, bro--do we have a <i>deal</i>?</p>


     <p>Darren stared at Quinn for a second, then sighed, <i>resigned</i> to his fate. He chuckled to himself--his youngest sister's business <i>acumen</i> was nothing short of <i>remarkable</i>--she had accounted for virtually <i>every</i> contingency--or so it <i>seemed</i>. In that aspect, he had to <i>admire</i> Quinn for her <i>doggedness</i> and <i>"business negotiation"</i>--he wondered half-seriously if she actually <i>could</i> fit in well at Appleton's fashion division, Circa. He also supposed that if he was going to get Daria a new <i>computer</i>, then Quinn should get <i>something</i> as well--even if it <i>was</i> for keeping the <i>peace</i> with Jane.</p>


<p>DARREN: Okay, Quinn--it's a <i>deal</i>. If our parents ask, I'll tell them I did it for your <i>birthday. (Thought v.o.: Although I'm sure Daria <b>won't</b> believe that--and I guess I can't blame her. She and Jane are <b>right</b>--I <b>am</b> too nice.)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Squeals with delight, hugs and kisses her brother on the cheek:)</i> Thanks, bro! <i>(Gets off bed, narrows her eyes, begins to pace:)</i> Let's see, now--our reservations at <i>Chez Pierre</i> are for 7:00, and it's almost <i>2:30</i> now, and that gives us, like, four-and-a-half hours--<i>(pauses, looks at Darren:)</i> when's Jane comin' over, bro?</p>

<p>DARREN: I'm not sure--she said she'd be over in a while--why?</p>

<p>QUINN: Well, we <i>don't</i> have too much time for us to go to <i>Cashman's</i> and look. <i>(Darren looks puzzled)</i> I <i>need</i> to know what I'm gonna get, bro--one can't be <i>too</i> careful when it comes to fashion--it takes <i>time</i>! Can't you just <i>call</i> Jane and ask her to come here <i>now</i> if she's not busy with her little <i>"art-stuff"</i>? <i>(Darren rolls his eyes)</i> I mean, she's gonna have to talk to Daria about you <i>anyway</i>, so see if she can come as soon as possible, okay? The sooner we can leave, the sooner we can be ready to go to <i>Chez Pierre</i>!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles, talks in a good-humoured tone, puts up his hands:)</i> Okay, okay! I'll call and see if she can come. <i>(Gets up)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: Oh, yeah--there's something <i>else</i> I wanted to ask you before you call Jane, bro. It's really nothing, but--um, yesterday morning I kind--of--well, heard mom and dad say that you call them by their <i>first</i> names. <i>(Darren cocks an eyebrow)</i> What's the deal with <i>that</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gives a quick chuckle:)</i> Ah, and I suppose you were <i>with</i> Daria when you heard them say that? She didn't tell me when she asked me about it last night.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(At first surprised, then becomes red-faced, looks away:)</i> She <i>did</i>? Well, I wasn't <i>exactly</i> with her when she heard mom and dad say that. I heard her come by my door, and I got up to see what was goin' on, and uh--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Raises an eyebrow:)</i> --You <i>saw</i> Daria listening to our parents talk? <i>(Grins when Quinn nods:)</i> Like I told Daria, I just couldn't call them <i>"Mom" and "Dad"</i> right out like that--<i>(his voice goes low:)</i> you know, because it would be like <i>not</i> respecting my deceased (adopted) parents, and all they've done for me. <i>(Pauses, slightly alarmed for some reason, gives Quinn an uncertain look:)</i> You're not thinking of calling them by their <i>first</i> names because you heard that <i>I</i> did, right? I mean, I only did that when I knew you and Daria <i>weren't</i> around to hear.</p>


     <p>Quinn giggled, waving Darren off.</p>


<p>QUINN: C'mon, bro--you just gave me a good reason <i>not</i> to an' stuff. I can understand that that wouldn't have been fair to your (adopted) parents. Don't worry--I'll <i>still</i> call them <i>"Mom" an' "Dad"--(adds as an afterthought, shrugs:)</i> besides, I call them <i>"Helen" and "Jake"</i> sometimes when they're <i>not</i> around to my <i>friends</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks at Quinn with an arched eyebrow, thinking Daria had said the <b>same</b> thing last night:)</i> Well, uh, all right--I'll go and call Jane.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(In her singy-songy voice, smiles:)</i> Okay, Darren. <i>(Darren leaves, while Quinn makes room in her closet for her new clothes)</i></p>


<p><i>(Scene is back at the Lane's)</i></p>


     <p>Jane looked over her newest masterpiece on her easel, with paint-covered hands on her hips, and a prideful smirk on her speckled paint-covered face. She had finished it in <i>personal</i> record time--it was going to be a <i>surprise</i> for the Morgendorffers. After spraying it with a clear, protective coating, Jane covered the painting (making sure it was dry) with a white bedsheet and wrapped it up carefully. She was completing the wrapping, when the cell phone in her room rang. Jane grabbed a paint-stained damp towel hanging on her bedroom chair and wiped her hands, then answered her cell phone on the third ring.</p>


<p>JANE: Yo!</p>

<p>VOICE: Hey, Jane--did I call at a <i>bad</i> time?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smiles:) Darren</i>? Hey! Nah--you called at a good time--I had just finished, um--some <i>art. (Pauses:)</i> Uh--did everything go well when you got back to the Morgendorffers?</p>

<p>DARREN: It's okay, Jane--<i>(chuckles:)</i> the coast is <i>clear</i>. Daria said that it was fine with her about us, so relax. <i>Jake</i> even said it was <i>okay</i> with him. Helen and <i>(pauses:) Quinn</i> eventually accepted it, so you can come over with <i>no</i> reservations--and as I told you this morning over breakfast, Quinn and I are planning to go to <i>Chez Pierre</i> tonight, <i>(sighs:)</i> so, <i>if</i> you can, do you think it's possible for you to come over as soon as you deem it fit to do so? Quinn asked me if you could so she could get ready for the "date" she and I are having.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Snorts:)</i> Well, we couldn't keep <i>Quinn</i> waiting, could we? <i>(She then sighs, relieved, though she still thought she heard some sort of <b>reservation</b> in Darren's voice about Quinn's okay, playfully swings her fist:)</i> Sure! Lemme get cleaned up real quick, and I'll be on my way.</p>

<p>DARREN: Okay--<i>(pauses:)</i> do you--well, need for me to come and pick you <i>up</i>, or something?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks, in a semi-mockingly playful tone:) Awww</i>--isn't that <i>sweet</i>. Ah, I can <i>use</i> the walk--it isn't <i>that</i> far. <i>(Thought v.o.: That and not letting you see my surprise <b>gift</b> to you and your family, Darren.)</i> Gimme about 20 minutes, and I'll be there.</p>

<p>DARREN: Okay, see you then, Jane. <i>(Hangs up)</i></p>


     <p>Darren clicked off his cell phone, went to Quinn's room to tell her Jane was on her way, then came back to his room. He then went through his clothes bag hanging in the closet, looking for something appropiate to wear to this <i>Chez Pierre</i> tonight--according to Quinn, it was <i>"a really fancy"</i> French restaurant, so he decided to wear a black dress jacket and matching pants, his best suit, as well as the <i>most</i> expensive one he had--the other clothes he had were basically "regular" clothing. He certainly could have brought <i>many</i> expensive clothes made by Circa Fashions with him, but he would have possibly garnered <i>questions</i> by the Morgendorffers over how he could <i>afford</i> such clothing, and most definitely the vast majority of them would have come from <i>Quinn</i>. Darren felt that for sure Quinn had the <i>potential</i> for being a very good fashion designer, (she decided after a good <i>cry</i> that modeling was <i>not</i> the way to go after Darren told her of the chances of succeeding in the modeling industry, even <i>with</i> his help) the same for Daria being a very good writer, and Jane succeeding in her field of art. As he zipped open the side pocket of the bag, something <i>fell</i> out onto the carpeted floor. It caught his eye, and he turned <i>pale</i> for a moment. <i>How did <b>that</b> get in there?</i></p>

     <p><i>"That"</i> was a picture of him and Stephanie Reardon. He bent over and picked it up, and stared at it intently for a moment. He remembered when it was taken--about six months ago while at Eastward College, just outside calculus class by Curtis, and Darren had his arm around her waist, holding her close. Stephanie was grinning at the camera with her pearly-white teeth showing and her thick, black hair was in its regular ponytail style, with the ponytail part lying on her right shoulder, similiar to a female Native American hairstyle. Stephanie's small, round, face, and dark brown eyes were full of joy. She wore a red sweater with the Eastward reed and book symbol on the upper right part of her chest. She was gone now--<i>never</i> to return. It would do little to no good to keep thinking about it, save for keeping the good memories. Stephanie <i>would</i> want him to go on--no doubt about that. He grew a bit wistful, then smiled slowly as he thought about <i>Jane</i>. If there was any girl that could help him go on, he believed for some <i>reason</i> it could be her--but he did not want to like her just to help him get <i>over</i> Stephanie--that wouldn't be <i>fair</i> to Jane--or the <i>memory</i> of Stephanie, or even <i>himself</i>. Of course, it could be the same way concerning Jane and Tom from <i>Jane's</i> point of view over seeing Darren to get over Tom, even though Jane said that her and Tom's relationship had gone <i>steadily</i> downhill for awhile--Darren pondered on whether he should <i>talk</i> to her later about that.</p>

     <p>His cell phone on his bed suddenly rang on its own. Perhaps Woo had <i>found</i> Sanchez? He quietly put the picture back in his bag, reached on the bed and clicked on the phone, and spoke.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Hesitating for a moment:)</i> Er--hello?</p>

<p>VOICE: <i>(Sounding quiet, and contrite:)</i> Hey, man--it's <i>me</i>. I'm calling from my grandma's.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Raised eyebrows, smiles, delighted and surprised:) Curtis</i>?</p> 

<p>CURTIS: The one and only. Look, I want to <i>apologize</i> for <i>snapping</i> at you the last time we talked. I know you wouldn't do anything like keep that sort of <i>secret</i> from your birth family if you could help it--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Cuts him off, eager to make amends:)</i> --No, no--you were <i>right</i>! Believe me when I say to you that if I could tell the Morgendorffers my <i>real</i> last name, I would've by now. It's just that-- <i>something's</i> come up, and, well--it's just not a good time right now.</p>

<p>CURTIS: <i>(Gives a sighing sound:)</i> It's cool. The reason why I'm calling is that I just had a close run-in with a <i>reporter</i> while I was out at a nearby mall with Lena. They came from the local TV station--must've made some sort of <i>damn</i> connection through some sources concerning our friendship. They tried like <i>hell</i> to get something, <i>hassling</i> us, but I told them to go take a <i>hike</i>. After experiencing <i>that</i> incident, I wanted to add that you've now gotten my <i>sympathy</i>, man--I <i>don't</i> blame you for not wanting to talk to the media right now. I told them to stay the hell away from <i>Lena</i>--she doesn't know where you are because I <i>didn't</i> tell her anything, and she hadn't <i>pushed</i> me on the subject.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Grinds his teeth in frustration:) Damn</i>. Curtis, I'm sorry for all of this--you and Lena shouldn't have had to take all that <i>garbage</i> for me. Hopefully, it won't be long before this is all over with. Is Lena all right?</p>

<p>CURTIS: Yeah, she's okay. <i>(Hesitates:)</i> I've been doing some thinking--does this--well--does this have anything to do with <i>Woo</i> investigating what happened with your parent's plane crash? <i>(Darren looks alarmed)</i> I couldn't help but to wonder <i>why</i> you couldn't tell me, and I even felt Lena <i>knew</i> something was wrong with me after she <i>caught</i> me acting pretty <i>angry</i> about my previous phone call to you when she and I were together the other night. She didn't say anything to me about <i>that</i>, either--<i>(chuckles:)</i> I couldn't keep <i>anything</i> from that girl.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Thought v.o.: Too bad <b>I</b> can't say the same--<b>yet</b>. Searches for words:)</i> Ah, Curtis--let's just say Woo's onto <i>something</i>, but he hasn't found anything <i>definitive</i> that we can use yet. <i>(Changes subject quickly:)</i> I meant to tell you--I--met a <i>girl</i> yesterday while jogging.</p> 

<p>CURTIS: <i>(Now sounds very excited, buys the change of subject:) Really</i>, now? Thatta boy! So, I assume she's quite a <i>looker</i>--?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles:) Oh</i> yeah, you'd <i>better</i> believe she is. Her name's <i>Jane Lane</i>--she also happens to be my sister Daria's <i>best</i> friend.</p>

<p>CURTIS: <i>(Now grows suddenly quiet, and after a pause:) Oh</i>. That sort of--<i>complicates</i> things, huh?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Grins:)</i> Heh--I <i>thought</i> that would bring you back <i>down</i> to earth. Don't worry--it's <i>no</i> big deal. Let me tell you <i>how</i> Jane and I met--</p>


     <p>Quinn went to Daria's room to tell her about Jane coming over.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(Knocks:)</i> Daria, it's me. <i>Can</i> I come in?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Now off of her computer, and on her bed, propped up reading Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's <b>Hound of the Baskervilles</b>:)</i> Sure, <i>"me". (Quinn comes in)</i> Oh, and by the way, it's <i>"<b>May</b> I come in".</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Frowns, hands on her hips:)</i> Why should <i>you</i> come in, Daria? <i>I'm</i> the one coming into <i>your</i> room. You're <i>already</i> here.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> As <i>Archie Bunker</i> would say: <i>"Dingbat, dingbat, dingbat! (Sighs while Quinn looks at Daria, confused:)</i> Never mind. What do you want, oh-fashion-obsessed-<i>"cousin"</i>-of-mine? <i>(Smirks)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Glares:) Ha</i>, Daria. Anyway, Darren just told me that Jane's on her way over here. <i>(Shrugs, as if what she just said was a <b>minor</b> afterthought:)</i> I just thought you wanted to know, or <i>something</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> Why Quinn--how <i>nice</i> of you to to tell me that Jane was coming over <i>(sneers:) "just for me to know". (Faux gasp:)</i> Why, you'd <i>think</i> Jane and I <i>actually</i> knew each other, and were <i>"best"</i> friends, or <i>"something"</i>.</p> 

<p>QUINN: <i>(Narrows her eyes:)</i> Ha <i>again</i>, Daria. <i>(Turns around:)</i> Well, I've done <i>my</i> job. I'm going downstairs where mom and dad are, and wait for--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(While getting off of her bed, puts her book aside:)</i> --Hold it, <i>"Red". (Quinn turns around)</i> That reminds me--I wanted to ask you a question.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Impatient, hands on her hips:) What</i> is it, Daria?</p>

<p>DARIA: You just told me that Jane's coming over--you know, the <i>"Jane"</i> that <i>likes</i> our brother? You don't sound <i>too</i> upset over this particular development <i>now</i> as opposed to when we were downstairs when we first heard it. <i>(Quinn rolls her eyes while Daria continues)</i> Okay, <i>how much</i>?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> How much <i>what</i>, Daria?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Crosses her arms, looking stern:)</i> How much <i>crap</i> did you <i>con</i> our <i>"too-nice-of-a-bro"</i> out of to <i>play</i> nice with Jane, <i>"cuz"</i>? Don't bother trying to <i>deny</i> it.</p>


     <p>Quinn fumed at Daria for a moment, then spoke.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>Fine</i>. Yeah, I <i>did</i> get something out of Darren--but it's for my <i>birthday</i> next month--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> --You mean, the <i>"cover"</i> is that it's for your birthday. <i>(Pauses:)</i> So, what was it? <i>Money</i>? <i>Clothes</i>
--? Maybe a little of <i>both</i>?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Now crosses <b>her</b> arms, defiant:)</i> Since you wanna know so badly, it's <i>clothes</i> from <i>Cashman's</i>. After we meet Jane, Darren's gonna take me there to get some <i>before</i> we come back here and get ready to go to <i>Chez Pierre</i> tonight.</p>


     <p>Daria looked at Quinn and slowly shook her head, quietly <i>disgusted</i>. After a moment, Quinn frowned at Daria, more out of confusion than anger.</p>


<p>QUINN: God, what's <i>your</i> problem, Daria? Darren <i>agreed</i> to say they were for my birthday in case mom and dad asked, so why're you goin' <i>postal</i> about this?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sighs:)</i> Quinn, you're getting Darren to spend his <i>own</i> money on you, not only for <i>Chez Pierre</i>, but <i>Cashman's</i> as well. <i>(Pauses:)</i> That money, however <i>little</i> Darren has, came as an <i>inheritance</i> from the <i>deaths</i> of his adopted parents. I'm only <i>guessing</i> that it's <i>not</i> all that much--and all of this <i>after</i> he's helped you with preparing for going to the Fashion Institute, <i>and</i> getting an internship at Circa Fashions, where his late adopted mother worked. <i>(Quinn turns pale while Daria frowns:)</i> I mean, birthday, or not--how could you just take <i>advantage</i> of him like that? <i>(Pauses:)</i> And now when I <i>think</i> about it, you've just done the same thing you thought I accused <i>you</i> of doing when you tried to pull that trick of getting Darren to go along with saying that he was your cousin, remember? How <i>incredibly</i> prophetic. Isn't he doing <i>more</i> than enough for you? Don't you have any <i>decency</i> at <i>all</i>, Quinn? I thought even <i>you</i> had at least a <i>little</i>.</p>


     <p>Quinn stared at Daria, stunned, apparently at a loss for words. She  remembered the talk she just had with Darren over calling her parents "Jake" and "Helen", and <i>why</i> he did so. The cold reality hit Quinn <i>hard</i>--she <i>was</i> taking advantage of Darren. She then looked down, <i>ashamed</i>.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(Trying to find what to say:)</i> D-Daria--I--uh--<i>(begins to cry:)</i> I'm--SORRY! <i>(Suddenly leaves Daria's room for her own)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Genuinely surprised at Quinn's reaction:)</i> Well, whattaya know--she <i>does</i> have a <i>conscience. (Goes after Quinn, thought v.o.: And I guess I <b>do</b>, too.:)</i> Wait a second, Quinn!</p>


     <p>Darren was just finishing talking to Curtis when he heard what sounded like a <i>crying</i> Quinn run by his closed door, then a door slamming. He frowned, perplexed.</p>


<p>DARREN: Hey, Curtis--something's just come up--do you mind if I call you back tomorrow or some other time?</p>

<p>CURTIS: <i>(Laughing sound:)</i> No problem, <i>"Mr. Mud Hero"</i>. Chill.</p>

<p>DARREN: Take it easy. <i>(Clicks off phone, gets off his bed, and looks in the hallway, sees Daria:)</i> Daria, what's going on? Was that <i>Quinn</i>?</p> 


     <p>Before Daria could answer, Helen and Jake had come upstairs when they heard Quinn's crying. Helen looked at Darren and Daria for an explanation, while Jake of course, was--well--being <i>Jake</i>.</p> 


<p>JAKE: <i>(Screams while holding his head:) WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG WITH MY LITTLE GIRL</i>?! <i>(Daria, having experienced this before, remains impassive, while Darren looks at Jake with a bit of a terrified look on his face) WHAT HAPPENED</i>?! <i>(Helen rolls her eyes. She, like Daria, has seen this as well.)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: Jake, calm down! <i>(Which he does, rather instantaneously, and Helen then looks back at Daria and Darren:)</i> Do you two know what's wrong with Quinn?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Prepares herself for the unenviable task of informing her parents as to why:)</i> Well, you see--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Suddenly jumps in, looks for words:)</i> --I told Quinn that--that--<i>sequin fashion</i> is out for this year, and that she's going to have to find a <i>new</i> fabric for the fall. <i>(Daria looks at Darren as if to say, <b>"Are you nuts?"</b>)</i> I guess she took it pretty <i>hard--(laughs uneasily, shrugs:)</i> you know how it is with Quinn and fashion.</p> 


     <p>Helen and Jake looked at each other for a second, baffled. Daria simply watched her parents and brother, expressionless, inwardly <i>amused</i> to see what would happen next.</p>


<p>HELEN: <i>(Now smiles with Jake, in her falsetto voice:) Ohhhh</i>, is that all? <i>(Daria rolls her eyes--Helen's brought the story.)</i> Honestly--we thought something was really <i>amiss</i> with Quinn.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Supreme deadpan:)</i> That's been <i>obvious</i> for <i>years</i>--I believe this came about when she was <i>born. (Darren holds in his humor--<b>barely</b>, while Helen rolls her eyes, exasperated)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Now suddenly concerned again:)</i> It <i>was</i>? Oh, NO! <i>(Looks at Helen, panicking:)</i> Honey, what are we gonna--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Sighs loudly, while turning Jake around and pushing him back down the stairs:)</i> Come <i>on</i>, Jakey--Daria was only <i>joking</i>. Let me take you back to your Sunday paper--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Calls to Helen while she's pushing Jake downstairs:)</i> --And you can get back to your Sunday <i>paperwork. (Helen gives Daria a quick, annoyed glare before going out of sight)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Realizes something, goes to the top of the stairs and shouts down to Helen and Jake:)</i> Oh, I forgot to tell you two that Jane's on her way over!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(From below, after a moment:)</i> Oh, she <i>is</i>? Well, we'll watch out for her, son--thank you.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Goes back to Daria:)</i> Okay, sis--I <i>bought</i> you some <i>time</i> over Quinn. What happened?</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> How do you know that <i>I</i> had something to do with Quinn crying?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Slightly smirks:)</i> Call it a wild "hunch". It sounded like she was coming from <i>your</i> room.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sighs:)</i> Good guess. Okay, here's the lowdown--</p>


<p><i>(Scene changes to down the street from the Morgendorffer's home)</i></p>


     <p>Jane walked down the sidewalk carrying the wrapped-up canvas of artwork under her arm. She hoped it would help smooth over any of the "rocky" bumps she might encounter when she would see the Morgendorffers. Jane still felt that everything would <i>not</i> be a-okay, even with Darren's assurances--after all, she felt he had <i>hesitated</i> over Quinn saying it was fine. Jane smirked to herself over this thought. She figured somehow or another that <i>"The Queen"</i> had gotten <i>something</i> in exchange for her <i>"approval"</i> of Jane seeing Darren--Daria had explained how Quinn <i>"operated"</i> to Jane in the past, as well as Jane seeing Quinn in action herself at various times. Oh well--Jane did not expect a <i>rousing</i> response from Quinn either way--might as well grin and bear it.</p>

     <p>Helen would be--<i>tolerant</i> of the relationship for Darren's sake
--Trent's little deduction about her not wanting to push Darren away was probably true, but Jane <i>really</i> did want Helen to go along with Jane liking Darren, and not just to do so for her son's sake. Jane was a little surprised that Jake actually <i>supported</i> Darren seeing her--maybe he <i>was</i> getting a backbone after all.</p>

     <p>Though sure that Daria would go along with Jane seeing Darren, Jane still felt <i>unsure</i> for some reason about Daria's <i>overall</i> response. She would have to <i>apologize</i> to Daria for <i>"misleading"</i> her on Jane's feelings for Darren--and that within itself actually gave Jane some inner <i>pain</i>, for Jane had rarely kept her opinions to herself when she talked to her <i>"Partner-In-Crime"</i> about anything. Not only that, but Jane privately believed that by liking Darren, it kind of <i>"twisted the knife"</i> in Daria's heart--Jane could actually get with <i>Daria's</i> brother Darren, but Daria could <i>not</i> get with <i>Jane's</i> brother Trent, even with Jane's "help"--though Jane could not know for <i>sure</i> that Daria even still <i>had</i> an interest in him. <i>Damn</i>, this wasn't fair--but then again, <i>what</i> was? Jane decided that at least for now, <i>that</i> little subject should be left <i>alone</i>--no need to <i>alienate</i> her friend over such speculations.</p>

     <p>Jane finally saw the Morgendorffer's home coming into view. Her heart suddenly began to <i>race</i>--why in the <i>hell</i> was that happening? <i>You've been there <b>hundreds</b> of times, girl--what's the big deal? Is it <b>seeing</b> Darren, or hoping things go well when you see the Morgendorffers? Maybe a little of <b>both</b>?</i> Feeling a bit nervous, Jane found herself clutching her wrapped-up artwork a little <i>tighter</i> under her arm--she hoped it would do the trick in making <i>peace</i> with the Morgendorffers--and even against hope, <i>Quinn</i>.</p>


<p><i>(Scene is back at the Morgendorffer's--the hallway)</i></p>


     <p>Daria had finished explaining why Quinn had cried after Daria had talked to her. Darren shook his head slowly, sighing.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Softly:)</i> Oh, Daria--look, I appreciate your <i>defending</i> me over thinking that Quinn was taking <i>advantage</i> of me, and taking some of my--<i>minuscule</i> amount of money I got from my deceased (adopted) parents. <i>(Pauses:)</i> To a certain extent, you're probably <i>right</i>, she is--but it's <i>okay</i>--I don't mind buying something for Quinn.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Arches an eyebrow:)</i> You're <i>sure</i> there's not going to be any problem, Darren? I mean, yeah, I felt <i>really</i> bad over what I said to Quinn,  but I <i>also</i> know that it was <i>true</i> about the things she does in <i>using</i> people.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Yes, you told me about Quinn <i>"pulling the wool"</i> over people's eyes, remember? <i>(Smiles:)</i> And Daria, Quinn <i>did</i> cry after you said that to her. If she didn't, Quinn would've just <i>shrugged off</i> what you talked to her about, and wouldn't have felt <i>anything</i>--</p>

<p>DARIA: --And as I um, <i>thought</i> to myself when she left my room, she <i>does</i> have a conscience. <i>(Pauses, shrugs:)</i> Well, it's <i>your</i> money, bro.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> Thanks, sis--now let's go and cheer Quinn up. <i>(Starts knocking on Quinn's door:)</i> Quinn? It's Darren and Daria! Will you let us come in?</p>


     <p>Unbeknowest to Daria and Darren, Quinn had been <i>listening</i> to their conversation in the hallway with an ear on her bedroom door, or to at least the end portion of their talk. She really <i>had</i> felt badly about using her brother to get some clothes from <i>Cashman's</i>--Daria sure had laid it on the "guilt trip" <i>thick</i>. Quinn could not remember Daria <i>ever</i> going after her like that over getting something from someone--she could even say that Daria <i>herself</i> took advantage of <i>her</i> when Daria wanted something--more than just the <i>"cousin"</i> thing, notwithstanding. Certainly, Daria had <i>blackmailed</i> her at various times, such as doing Daria's chores around the house in return for not telling their parents over something bad Quinn had done, <i>(Note to reader: See "Malled" for but one example of this)</i> or giving money to Daria for Daria to do her homework, or something else during their various <i>"bargaining sessions".</i> With some rare exceptions, this had always been the case in the past in one form, or another.</p>

     <p>Then <i>Darren</i> came into the picture, and Daria seemed to <i>change</i> somewhat <i>(in a very small way)</i>--and to a certain extent, Quinn <i>herself</i>. Daria had <i>refused</i> to go along when Quinn approached her and offered Daria money for saying that Darren was <i>Daria's</i> cousin--and Quinn saw the end result of <i>that</i> little fiasco. Darren had <i>whipped</i> Joey, Jeffrey, and <i>Jack</i>--no, wait--<i>Jamie</i>, when they thought Darren was her boyfriend, and had jumped on him in the Pizza King, thus letting them get the word out to all of her perspective suitors in Lawndale, (as misunderstood as that was) that Quinn was <i>off</i> limits. Much to her surprise, Quinn did <i>not</i> get angry at her brother for unwittingly doing so--and that of itself <i>confused</i> her in a way. Having <i>no</i> dates to go out on, she found herself <i>studying</i>, with Darren's help, and going over the curriculum for the Fashion Institute. She discovered, thanks to Darren again, that it indeed <i>did</i> take <i>"brains"</i> to get an <i>associate of arts</i> degree. Normally, Quinn would've <i>blanched</i> at doing "brainy" things, but she then began to realize that being in fashion design <i>was</i> a "brainy" thing that she <i>could</i> do, and she actually started  to--<i>enjoy</i> it--again, thanks to her brother's encouragement.</p> 

     <p>Then there was <i>Jane</i>. Quinn obviously did not like the <i>"art geek"</i>, Daria's <i>"weirdo"</i> friend, especially since Quinn thought that she was seeing that <i>Tim</i>--no, wait--<i>Tom</i> guy. Okay, <i>fine</i>--so Big Bro saved Jane's <i>life--any</i> girl would be <i>grateful</i> for that--especially by someone as <i>hunky</i> as her bro--but one <i>kiss</i>, and <i>instant</i> attraction? Come <i>on</i>! <i>Well then</i>, she had thought, <i>if you <b>really</b> find yourself attracted to her, bro, fine--but you're gonna have to <b>pay</b> for <b>my</b> approval</i>. Quinn thought about what she was going to get in <i>addition</i> for a dinner at <i>Chez Pierre</i> from Darren--nothing out of the <i>ordinary</i> for her, and laid on her sisterly <i>charm</i> to Darren--and he <i>fell</i> for it, having <i>no</i> other choice, of course. Then came Daria and her <i>damn</i> talk--and Quinn finding herself feeling <i>genuinely</i> guilty--and even <i>crying</i> over it! She came to her senses when she heard knocking on her bedroom door, and quickly wiped her wet eyes with the back of her hand--she hoped that her <i>make-up</i> wasn't running.</p> 


<p>DARREN: <i>(Finishes knocking:)</i> I guess she's <i>still</i> upset, Daria--I've been knocking for about <i>20</i> seconds, and Quinn's not answering.</p>

<p>DARIA: Well, maybe we should leave her for now, bro, and--</p>


     <p>The door suddenly <i>flew</i> open, and Quinn stood in the doorway, looking red-faced and red-eyed. She looked hesitantly between the two, and spoke before they could.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(In a contrite tone, or as contrite as someone like Quinn could get:)</i> Darren, I'm--<i>sorry. (Darren and Daria look at each other, shocked)</i> I shouldn't have asked you to buy me some clothes an' stuff like that just so that I could be nice to Jane. We <i>don't</i> have to go to <i>Cashman's, (and adds after a pause:)</i> or <i>Chez Pierre</i>, if you don't want to. <i>(Looks down)</i></p>


     <p>Daria narrowed her eyes for a second, then walked forward, and gently brushed past Quinn, going into Quinn's room, and started to look around. Quinn and Darren looked at each other, confused.</p>


<p>DARREN: Uh, Daria, <i>what</i> are you doing?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(While still looking around:)</i> I'm trying to find the <i>real</i> Quinn. The one with us here is obviously a <i>replacement</i> Quinn. <i>(Looks at Quinn:) Who</i> are you, and what did you do with <i>our</i> Quinn, and more importantly, can you keep her from <i>ever</i> coming back? <i>(Darren chuckles while Quinn rolls her eyes)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>Look</i>--I just, well, decided that um, maybe you were <i>right</i> about me wanting things from our bro, Daria--I mean, I guess Darren did help me <i>way</i> more than I realized an' stuff, and I probably was a little <i>too</i> selfish, that's all. <i>(Daria raises an eyebrow at Quinn that says, "A <b>little</b> too selfish?")</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Walks up to Quinn, puts a hand on her shoulder:)</i> Quinn, it's all right. I don't see any harm in you getting at least <i>one</i> new dress for our "date" tonight at this <i>Chez Pierre</i>. You <i>did</i> earn it--especially given what you did just now, being <i>unselfish</i>, considering everything that Daria said to you. <i>(Quinn looks shocked at Darren, while Daria says nothing)</i> Tell you what--we'll see Jane, then you and I will go to <i>Cashman's</i>, okay?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Gasps, delighted:)</i> Y-you <i>really</i> mean it, bro? I-I was really kind of <i>rezoned</i> to staying here--</p>

<p>DARIA: --Quinn, that's <i>resigned</i>--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Frowns slightly at Daria:) --whatever</i>, but if you want me to go, Darren, then I will.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Grins:)</i> Teriffic, sis. Now let's--</p>


     <p>At that moment, the doorbell rang from downstairs.</p>


<p>DARIA: That's gotta be <i>Jane</i>, bro--the <i>time</i> is at hand. See you guys downstairs. <i>(Leaves)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Right behind you, Daria--<i>(looks at Quinn:)</i> coming, sis?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Smiles weakly:)</i> Lemme fix up my face, and I'll be down in a minute, okay, Darren?</p>

<p>DARREN: Okay, sis--don't be too long. <i>(Leaves while Quinn shuts her door)</i></p>


     <p>Jane had been let in and welcomed by Helen, who gave a nice, but somewhat <i>forced</i> smile to Jane. Jane walked into the living room holding the wrapped-up painting she had done. Jake got up off the right couch and gave his usual <i>clueless</i> smile, putting his paper aside, and reached out to shake Jane's hand, welcoming her as well, while Helen noticed what Jane was holding, and inquired.</p>


<p>HELEN: <i>(Raises an eyebrow:)</i> Jane, what's that you've got under your arm?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Thought v.o.: It isn't a <b>bomb</b> or a <b>gun</b>, Helen.:)</i> It's a--<i>"peace offering"</i> of sorts, Mrs. Morgendorffer. I hope you guys like it.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Looks confused, surprised:)</i> A <i>"peace offering"</i>? Why, Jane, you don't feel like we're your--<i>(pauses:) enemy</i> just because you might not think we want you to see our son, do you?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Thought v.o.: <b>"Might"</b> not? You're <b>kidding</b>, right?:)</i> Not at <i>all</i>, Mrs. Morgendorffer--I just wanted to present you guys with something that'll kind of <i>"symbolize"</i> your <i>blossoming</i> relationship with your long-lost son, that's all.</p> 


     <p>Daria had just come down the stairs and caught the tail-end of Jane's remark. She walked up to Jane.</p>


<p>DARIA: Hey, Jane--<i>(smirks:)</i> what's this that I hear about some sort of "symbol" and "blossoming"? <i>(Eyes Jane's "gift":)</i> Hmmm--don't tell me you've painted a field of <i>condoms</i> as far as the eye can see?</p>

<p>JAKE & HELEN: <i>(Red-faced while Jane smirks:) DARIA</i>!</p>


     <p>Darren came down the stairs, saw Jane, and slowly <i>smiled</i>. Jane saw Darren and <i>returned</i> the same smile--this moment was not lost on Daria, Helen, and Jake.</p>


<p>DARREN: Hi, Jane.</p>

<p>JANE: Hi, Darren.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Walks up beside Jane and Daria, looks around at everybody else:)</i> Quinn will be down in a minute--she's making herself <i>decent</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: Now that's next to <i>impossible</i>--I thought I <i>told</i> her that already. <i>(Jane smirks some more while Darren gives Daria a little of an <b>admonitory</b> smirk, and Helen and Jake look at each other, miffled)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Notices Jane's package now:)</i> Jane, what's that your holding? It looks like some sort of canvas-shaped work of art.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Well, Darren, like I told your parents--</p>


     <p>At that moment, Quinn came down the steps with her <i>sickenly</i> (to Daria and Jane, at least) sweet smile, voice, and charm. Daria cocked an eyebrow when she noticed that somehow, someway, Quinn had actually been able to pull off <i>looking</i> decent--she had shook off the rather <i>pathetic</i>, red-eyed, red-faced visage that Daria and Darren had witnessed when they went to see Quinn. Daria glanced at her brother, and saw that even <i>he</i> had seen the difference. Though she'd <i>never</i> admit it, Daria had to give it to Quinn--her sister <i>did</i> have the talent to fix herself up in a <i>hell</i> of a hurry.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(In her singy-songy voice:) Hiiii</i>, everybody! <i>(Looks at Jane, her voice <b>neutral</b>:)</i> Um, <i>hey</i>, Jane.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Her voice neutral as well:) Hey</i>, Quinn. <i>(Quickly looks around to everyone else, goes to the front of the room, and sits the wrapped-up canvas on the center couch:)</i> Well, folks--since you're all here now, I want to give you all something that I painted from my--uh--<i>heart</i> to celebrate Darren being here with you all. <i>(Everyone looks at each other, intrigued, while Jane unwraps her "gift", and shows it:) Viola</i>!</p>


     <p>Helen, Jake, Quinn, and Darren looked <i>stunned</i>, and <i>gasped</i>, while Daria simply looked at Jane's work, wordlessly, cocking a <i>slight</i> eyebrow.</p>

     <p>The painting was a group portrait of the Morgendorffers and Darren, Jake on the left rear and Helen on the right rear of the picture, with Jake having his right hand on Quinn's right shoulder, and his left hand on Darren's right shoulder. Helen had her right hand on Darren's left shoulder, with her left hand on Daria's left shoulder. Helen and Jake were standing behind a sitting Darren, Quinn, and Daria. Darren, dressed in a brown dress jacket and suit, and smiling, was in the center, flanked by a "cute" smiling Quinn on the left, her left arm hooked with Darren's right arm. Daria was on the right, <i>not</i> smiling (of course), and looking at her family with a bit of <i>disdain</i>, but she <i>did</i> have her right arm hooked with Darren's left arm, but it was done in such a way, as if Daria wanted to <i>hide</i> it from the <i>other</i> members of her family. Helen and Jake were dressed in their usual clothing, the same for Daria and Quinn. The background was of a greenish-gray tint. Jane had caught the facial features of the Morgendorffers and Darren almost <i>perfectly</i>.</p>


<p>HELEN: <i>(Begins to cry:)</i> O-oh, <i>Jane</i>! T-this i-is so--so <i>beautiful</i>!</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Himself almost tearing up:)</i> Y-yeah--it's <i>great</i>, Jane-o!</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Still in shock, but does find the words:) W-wow</i>, Jane! You even got <i>both</i> of my good sides! I'm--so--so <i>cute</i>!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Turns to Jane with a look of disbelief, then forces himself to speak:)</i> Jane, this--is--is--<i>magnificent</i>! <i>(Jane gives him a quiet smile of appreciation)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shrugs, deadpan:)</i> Eh--it's <i>okay. (Jane simply gives Daria a look that says, <b>"Why am I not surprised?"</b>)</i></p> 


     <p>Overwhelmed with emotion, Helen rushed up to a stunned Jane and <i>hugged</i> her tightly. Jane looked like a <i>deer trapped in the headlights</i>, standing in place <i>rigidly</i>. Daria <i>wickedly</i> smirked at Jane, figuring she <i>deserved</i> to get the <i>"touchy-feely"</i> hug for painting such a <i>stomach-turningly</i> cute family portrait. While Jake was wiping his eyes, Quinn walked over to the painting, awed, and examined her painted self closer. Darren simply <i>smiled</i> at Helen hugging Jane--Jane apparently had <i>succeeded</i> in making peace with the Morgendorffers.</p> 

     <p>Everyone (save for Daria, who simply watched the "festivities" with her arms crossed) had talked about the picture, which Jake and Darren had hung up over the Morgendorffer's front wall in the living room. Jane was peppered with questions.</p>


<p>HELEN: <i>(While looking up at the picture, her arm around Jake's waist:)</i> Jane, <i>however</i> were you able to <i>capture</i> us on the canvas like that? It's as if we had <i>poised</i> for you while you painted us.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Well, Mrs. Morgendorffer, <i>(sneaks a peek at Darren, who's standing beside her looking up at the painting:)</i> let's just say that I was <i>inspired. (At Jane's emphasis on the word "inspired", Darren cuts his eyes down to her and smiles quietly, while everyone other than Jake gets the implication)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(While looking at the painting as well:)</i> How <i>long</i> did it take you to do this, Jane?</p>

<p>JANE: About <i>two hours. (Jake whistles)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Ditto like Helen and Jake:)</i> Well, I gotta say <i>this</i> is better than those <i>funny-looking</i> paintings you <i>usually</i> do, Jane. <i>(Jane rolls her eyes, annoyed, while Darren simply sighs at Quinn, exasperated, and Daria frowns at her slightly. Helen and Jake are still too engrossed in the painting to notice what Quinn had said)</i> You caught me <i>pefectly</i>!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Now smirks:)</i> Too bad she couldn't have caught you in your <i>"early-morning"</i> mode--now <i>that</i> would have been the <i>"real"</i> Quinn we all know and love <i>so</i> well. <i>(Jane and Darren look at each other, trying not to laugh, while Helen and Jake now look at Daria and give barely-noticible frowns of disapproval)</i></p> 

<p>QUINN: <i>(Looks at Daria with contempt:)</i> Oh, that's <i>reeeal</i> funny, Daria--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Still smirks:) --I</i> thought so--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Either not noticing or ignoring Daria:)</i> --but Darren and I have gotta get ready to go.</p>

<p>HELEN: Oh, that's right--you two are going to Chez Pierre tonight, aren't you? <i>(Looks at her watch:)</i> It seems <i>awfully</i> early to get ready, isn't it?</p>

<p>DARREN: We're going to <i>Cashman's</i> to get Quinn a new dress for her to wear tonight. <i>(Jane cocks an inquisitve, but knowing eyebrow at this, while Daria says nothing)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Looks at Quinn with a slight frown:)</i> Now Quinn, I don't think it's <i>appropiate</i> to--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Steps in between Helen and Quinn:)</i> --No, no, it's all right. I <i>insist</i> that I do this, okay? <i>(Looks between Helen and Jake:)</i> After all, you two haven't <i>allowed</i> me to use my money to help pay for <i>anything</i> while I've been staying here, so the least I can do is <i>this</i>. Anyway, it's just <i>one</i> dress. <i>(Smiles down at Helen, puts his hand reassuringly on her shoulder:) Please</i>? <i>(Jane and Daria look at each other knowingly--Darren's going to win over Helen--<b>again</b>.)</i></p>


     <p>Helen's face softened <i>considerably</i>, and she smiled.</p>


<p>HELEN: Well, all right--<i>(looks at Quinn, her face becomes a little stern:)</i> but <i>only</i> one dress, sweetie.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Okay, Mom. Darren, I'm gonna go upsairs and get ready to go. It'll be a few minutes. <i>(Leaves to go upstairs)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Watches Quinn go up:)</i> And the world will <i>never</i> be the same.</p> 

<p>HELEN: Jane, thank you <i>so</i> much. You put a lot of effort into the painting in such a <i>short</i> time--<i>(pauses:)</i> at least maybe we can <i>pay</i> you--?</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Comes up with Helen, begins to dig out his wallet:) Yeah</i>!</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Waves them off:)</i> No, no--like I said, the painting is a <i>gift</i>--nothing more, nothing <i>less</i>. Just you guys <i>liking</i> it is <i>more</i> than enough for me. <i>(Daria snorts to herself)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: Well--all right--if you want it that way--</p>


     <p>Daria quietly looked over to Darren and Jane, seeing that they were looking at each other and wanting to <i>talk</i>. Daria then glanced over to her mom, and began to make some very quiet <i>grunting</i> noises to get Helen's attention. Daria succeeded, for Helen took notice, and motioned to Jake.</p>


<p>HELEN: Er, Jake--let's go <i>upstairs (motions her eyes up:)</i> --I--want to <i>show</i> you something.</p>

<p>JAKE: Huh? <i>(Looks blank for a second, then looks uneasily around:)</i> Oh, well--uh, Helen--don't you think it's er, a little too <i>early</i> for that sort of <i>thing</i>? I mean, it's not the <i>evening</i> yet! <i>(Helen rolls her eyes, red-faced and embarassed, while Daria and Jane smirk, and Darren chuckles)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Takes Jake's arm:)</i> Come <i>on</i>, Jake! <i>(Pulls him upstairs)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(While being pulled upstairs, his voice fades off:)</i> Okay, Helen, but don't ya think we ought to make sure the drapes are <i>closed</i> first?</p>


     <p>Daria looked back at Jane and Darren before going upstairs.</p>


<p>DARIA: I've <i>cleared</i> the room, you two--it's your space. Jane, I'll be in my room when you come up. <i>(Leaves)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Thanks, sis. <i>(Watches her go up, turns to Jane, smiling:)</i> So.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks, walking up to Darren, holding his hands:)</i> So.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(After a pause, looking down at her:)</i> Well, get it out--<i>tell</i> me.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> Tell you <i>what</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: Tell me how Quinn <i>conned</i> me out of getting a dress from <i>Cashman's</i> in return for her being <i>nice</i> to you. <i>(Grins:)</i> I <i>saw</i> the slight <i>look</i> you had when you heard of her getting one before she and I go out to this <i>Chez Pierre</i> tonight.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Hey, I kind of <i>expected</i> it from Quinn, so I'm not <i>really</i> surprised. She got what she <i>wanted</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: Actually, yes <i>and</i> no--and you could say that <i>Daria</i> had something to do with it--and as a result, Quinn learned a <i>valuable</i> lesson about <i>herself</i> in the process.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Stares blankly:)</i> Now you've <i>lost</i> me. Who did <i>what</i>?</p>


     <p>Darren smiled at Jane's confusion, and was about to answer when the doorbell rang.</p> 


<p>DARREN: <i>(Shouts up the stairs:)</i> I'll answer it! <i>(Goes to the door with Jane in tow:)</i> Now, who could <i>that</i> be?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Famous <i>last</i> words.</p>


     <p>Darren chuckled, and opened the door. <i>Tom</i> was standing there. Both Darren and Jane looked at him shocked, and then at each other. For his part, Tom looked surprisingly <i>calm</i>, something that seemed to <i>concern</i> Jane, though she did not show it outwardly.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks at Tom, feeling foolish:)</i> Oh, uh, <i>hey</i>, Tom.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Red-faced, in a quiet tone:)</i> Yo. Tom.</p>

<p>TOM: <i>(Completely in a flat tone, "Daria-style":) Darren. Jane.</i></p> 


     <p>There was a long, awkward pause, then Tom spoke.</p>


<p>TOM: <i>(In slightly more of a normal tone:)</i> Ah--I just wanted to <i>thank</i> Daria for her <i>help</i> with trying to, well--<i>(looks away, talks low:)</i> you <i>know</i>, Jane. <i>(Darren looks confused, looks over at Jane, who knows all <b>too</b> well what Tom is talking about)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(In a small voice:)</i> Yeah, sure--<i>(pauses:)</i> you want to--come <i>in</i> to tell her <i>yourself</i>?</p>

<p>TOM: <i>(Looks uncomfortable for a moment:)</i> Er, no, that's okay, Jane, I'm not going to stay <i>long</i>, anyway--I'd appreciate if you would tell her for me, okay? <i>(Jane nods, and Tom turns to Darren, and hesitates:)</i> I'm here also to <i>thank</i> Darren for saving your life, Jane. <i>(Stiffly reaches out and shakes Darren's hand)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Now clearly uncomfortable, returning the handshake:)</i> Well, as I've said, <i>(looks uneasily at Jane:)</i> I'm just glad I happened to be around there when the sinkhole imploded.</p>

<p>TOM: <i>(Resigned, quiet:)</i> Yeah--and I'm <i>glad</i> you were, and I <i>mean</i> that. <i>(Takes a deep breath:)</i> I'm going out of town to <i>finish</i> my vacation.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Shows some slight concern:)</i> Oh? Um--anyplace in <i>particular</i>?</p>

<p>TOM: <i>(After a moment:)</i> I'll probably go and see some of my relatives in Palmerville. <i>(Looks at his watch:)</i> Well, I'd better go on. <i>(Turns around:)</i> I'll see you guys later. <i>(Starts to leave)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Uh, Tom--could you and I <i>talk</i> before you leave? <i>(Jane raises an eyebrow, while Tom gives Darren an unreadable look)</i> Jane, would you <i>excuse</i> us for a moment, please? <i>(Follows Tom out of the front, shuts the door before Jane can say anything, so Jane goes to the large front window and looks out through the drapes at the two, worried)</i></p>


     <p>Darren and Tom went out to the driveway.</p>


<p>TOM: <i>(Talks in a neutral tone:)</i> What did you want to talk to me about, Darren? <i>(Adds, arches an eyebrow:)</i> As if I <i>didn't</i> know.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Ponders for a second over Tom's words, then speaks plainly:)</i> Tom--I--didn't <i>plan</i> for this to happen with Jane and me--<i>(looks around for words:)</i> it just--<i>did</i>.</p>

<p>TOM: <i>(After a pause, then surprises Darren by chuckling:)</i> Hmm--it <i>usually</i> happens that way. The <i>same</i> thing occurred when Jane and I <i>first</i> met at the <i>Zen. (Note to reader: See "Jane's Addition")</i> Look, Darren--I am <i>angry</i>--but it's at <i>me</i> more than at anybody else, so <i>stop</i> feeling <i>guilty. (Pauses while Darren looks at him, shocked:)</i> After Jane left with Trent following our talk over breaking up, I couldn't sleep at <i>all</i> last night. All I could do is think about what happened between me and her, and of the <i>stupid</i> things that I said to her. She told me that she thought I was <i>controlling</i> her--and after I went back in my mind over what happened between us in the last few weeks, you know, she was <i>right. (Darren simply stares at Tom, deep in thought)</i> All of those dates we had--do you know that I took her for <i>granted</i>? <i>(Frowns:) Damn</i>! Why didn't I <i>see</i> what was happening before it was <i>too</i> late?</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Tries to find something to say:)</i> Tom--I--well--</p>

<p>TOM: <i>(Cuts Darren off:)</i> --She <i>liked</i> it, Darren.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks at Tom with a perplexed frown:)</i> Liked--<i>what</i>--?</p>

<p>TOM: The <i>kiss</i> she gave you at the Zen. Jane <i>wanted</i> to kiss you. She told me at the <i>end</i> of our talk. I knew then and there that there was <i>no</i> chance of us getting back together again.</p>

<p>DARREN: Yes, she <i>told</i> me she liked it.</p>

<p>TOM: <i>(After a moment:)</i> Yeah, I kind of figured that she <i>did</i>--and I assumed that <i>you</i> did as well.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Hesitates:)</i> Yeah--yeah, I <i>did</i>.</p>

<p>TOM: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Can't say I <i>don't</i> blame you. Jane was--<i>(looks off for a second:) was</i> one <i>hell</i> of a kisser --one <i>more</i> thing that I took for granted. I'm going to <i>reaccess</i> my life on my vacation, Darren. <i>(Adds:)</i> I can't believe I was such a <i>jerk</i>--how could I have been so <i>stupid</i>? <i>(Pauses:)</i> Look, I'm going to ask you for a <i>favor</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(After a moment:)</i> Sure--<i>anything</i>.</p>

<p>TOM: <i>(Sounding <b>very</b> serious:)</i> Take <i>care</i> of Jane for me, okay? That girl is a <i>wonderful</i> person, and you and Daria are <i>lucky</i> to have her in your lives. Can you do that for me?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sounding sincere:)</i> Yes, Tom--I <i>will. (Adds:)</i> But you don't seem to be such a <i>bad</i> person yourself.</p>

<p>TOM: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Oh, yes I <i>am</i>--otherwise, I'd <i>still</i> be with Jane. <i>(Darren smiles weakly)</i> Take care of yourself. <i>(Turns to go to his beat-up blue Pinto that's parked in front of the Morgendorffer's)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Quietly:)</i> Yeah--you too, Tom. <i>(Watches him get into his car, and it starts up, and leaves its usual trail of smoke, oil, and gas fumes)</i></p>


     <p>Jane watched the conversation between the two and sighed in <i>relief</i>. It looked like they parted ways on decent terms. She was about to go outside when <i>Quinn</i> came downstairs. Both girls stopped and looked at each other awkwardly. Quinn spoke up.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(Looks around:)</i> So, um, where's my bro?</p> 

<p>JANE: <i>(Motions with her eyes at the front door:)</i> He's--outside with <i>Tom</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Lets out a gasp:) Tom</i>? You mean your <i>ex-boyfriend</i>?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Glares at Quinn:)</i> Tom is <i>still</i> my friend, Quinn--it's not like we parted on <i>bad</i> terms. <i>(Thought v.o.: Unlike you and <b>your</b> so-called <b>army</b> of boyfriends--then they come running <b>back</b> for more)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Frowns:)</i> Well, I hope Tom <i>knows</i> what he's getting himself into if he wants to <i>fight</i> Darren, you know?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> Quinn, I saw Darren and Tom only <i>talk</i>, and <i>nothing</i> happened.</p>

<p>QUINN: Oh--that's a <i>relief</i>, I guess.</p>


     <p>Darren opened the front door and came in.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Walks up quietly to Darren:)</i> How--did--how did everything go between you two?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(After staring at Jane for a moment:)</i> Actually <i>better</i> than I thought. He's a <i>good</i> person, Jane--I wished it didn't end up like this.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Looks down:)</i> Yeah, I know. <i>(Looks back up:)</i> Well, I guess I'll go up and see Daria, then.</p> 

<p>DARREN: Sure, but before you do, <i>(looks at Quinn, tosses her his keys:)</i> Quinn, could you wait in my car for me, please?</p> 

<p>QUINN: <i>(Looks between the two:)</i> Um, sure, bro. <i>(Leaves, and Darren shuts the door)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Raises an eyebrow, curious:)</i> Okay, what's up, Darren?</p> 


     <p>Darren simply walked up to her and looked at Jane with a slight smile on his face. He put his hand on her cheek, softly caressing it. Jane looked at him, dumbfounded, her heart racing.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(In a soft tone:)</i> Nothing--I just wanted to get you alone to do <i>this</i>.</p>


   <p>Darren leaned over and kissed Jane <i>deeply</i>, putting his arms around her waist and pulling her up to him, then after a second, Jane began to put her arms around his neck. Unlike the <i>second</i> kiss, in which Jane initiated, (the first one was a total surprise, remember) and then Darren had followed her lead. <i>This</i> time it was <i>Darren</i> who took the lead. After about a <i>minute</i>, the two stopped the kissing.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Clearly swept off of her feet, her voice <b>squeaking</b>, looking up at Darren and hugging him around his waist:)</i> Not that I'm <i>complaining</i>, because I'm <i>not</i>--oh <i>hell</i> no, I'm not, but what was that rather <i>passionate</i> kiss for?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Because I find myself beginning to <i>care</i> about you, Jane Lane--don't you <i>forget</i> that. I'll talk to you after I come back with Quinn from <i>Cashman's. (Kisses her lightly on the lips, then speaks to her softly:)</i> See you. <i>(Leaves)</i></p>


     <p>Darren came out to his car with a <i>wide</i> grin on his face, something that Quinn immediately took note of. From all of her dates, she knew of <i>that</i> look, and sighed. Her brother <i>really</i> liked Jane, and she the <i>same</i> about him--as much as she did not like it, she'd <i>have</i> to <i>accept</i> it--more for <i>Darren's</i> sake than Jane's. As Darren got in the car, something on Darren's <i>mouth</i> garnered her attention, and she smirked.</p>


<p>QUINN: Um, <i>Darren</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looking forward dreamily:) Umm-hmm</i>?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Sounding in a "matter-of-fact" tone:)</i> You've got <i>lipstick</i> on your mouth.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Snaps out of his dream-state:) Eh</i>? <i>(Touches his mouth lightly, looks at his fingers and sees Jane's lipstick, turns red, and then wipes it off <b>furiously</b>:) Ohuhthankssis. (Quickly starts up car, and backs out of the driveway)</i></p>


     <p>Quinn stared at her brother for a second, then <i>giggled</i>. Darren <i>glared</i> at her for a moment, then he slowly broke out into a <i>grin</i>.</p>

<p>Jane could only stare at the door with a <i>dreamy</i> look on her face, having not moved an <i>inch</i> since Darren left.</p> 

     <p>Daria had come out of her room, looked down directly to the front door, and happened to <i>witness</i> the kiss near the end. She stared at the exchange <i>wide-eyed</i>, and simply said nothing, and was about to go back to her room after she saw Darren left, when she noticed that Jane kept standing there, with that <i>"I'm-in-heaven-and-I've-got-a-<b>goofy</b>-look-because-I've-been-kissed"</i> look on her face. After about <i>another</i> minute, in which Daria found herself looking <i>fasinated</i> at her friend's seemingly <i>rigor mortis</i> type of state, Daria slowly went down the stairs, came up to her best friend, and reluctantly waved her hand in front of Jane's blank-dreamy state face. Daria sighed, and pulled Jane up to her room. Jane blindly followed, still with the <i>same</i> look.</p>

     <p>Daria carefully sat a still-entranced Jane on Daria's bed, stared at her a second more, thought for the slightest moment to get a <i>paper bag</i> and <i>pop</i> it close to Jane's ear, then sighed, and started to <i>snap</i> her fingers rapidly. It took about <i>15</i> seconds before Jane finally came out of her stupor. Jane blinked, and looked at Daria.</p>


<p>JANE: Oh--uh, <i>yo</i>, Daria! <i>(Looks around:)</i> How in the <i>hell</i> did I get into your <i>room</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> I <i>retrieved</i> you from the <i>"Land of Dreamville"</i> while you were <i>"admiring the scenery". (Jane blushes)</i> Looks like you and my bro were <i>"Doin' The Nasty".</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Laughs weakly, looks sheepish:)</i> Yeah, I-I guess we <i>were</i>, huh? <i>(Pauses:)</i> Uh, I don't know <i>what</i> got into Darren like that, <i>(adds in a low voice, smirks sinisterly:)</i> but I kinda <i>liked</i> it.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shows a small smile, not quite Mona Lisa:)</i> I'm <i>sure</i> you did, <i>"Ms. Carnality"</i>.</p> 

<p>JANE: <i>(Looks off again:) Yeah. (Changes her tone, becomes hesitant:)</i> Oh--I meant--to tell you--<i>Tom</i> just came by.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:) Tom</i>? And he <i>saw</i> you guys together? <i>(Jane nods) Damn</i>. What happened?</p>

<p>JANE: Tom came to <i>thank</i> you for trying to keep me and him <i>together</i> before finishing up his vacation. <i>(Daria looks slightly concerned)</i> Now don't go and get your <i>dandruff</i> up and everything--the conversation was civil between all parties, <i>(narrows her eyes:)</i> although I thought I detected an <i>ever</i> so-slight tone of <i>hostility</i> from Tom. <i>(Adds, sighs:)</i> He also thanked Darren for saving my life.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>Oh</i>--I have to admit, <i>that</i> was big of him. I guess if I saw my <i>former</i> girlfriend that I just broke up with another guy, <i>I'd</i> be a little <i>peeved</i> myself. <i>(Jane arches her eyebrow, which Daria notices, and smirks:)</i> Hey, now it's <i>my</i> turn to say to you not to get <i>your</i> dandruff up. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Um--are you <i>sure</i> everything's okay with what happened downstairs?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Ponders:)</i> Yeah--I think so. Darren went <i>after</i> Tom to talk to him, and I watched--<i>(waits for Daria's reaction:)</i> and <i>nothing</i> happened.</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sighs in relief:)</i> Good--although potentially <i>fasinating</i>, I don't think <i>blood</i> would look too <i>appealing</i> all over our driveway--suffice it to say, <i>Tom's</i>, with my bro knowing martial arts, and all.</p>


     <p>Jane smiled at Daria weakly, looked up, and sighed. Daria looked at Jane, perplexed.</p>


<p>DARIA: Okay, what's <i>wrong</i>, Jane?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Looks pointedly at Daria:) Damn it</i>, Daria--when are you going to let me <i>have</i> it?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(With a confused frown:)</i> Uh--have <i>what</i>?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Gets up, walks around in a circle, her arms stretched out:)</i> Releasing your <i>rage</i> at me for <i>holding back</i> what I really <i>felt</i> for your brother after we kissed in the Zen, <i>that's</i> what! Why do I feel that you wanna <i>tell</i> me something?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Ah, you think I'm going to go <i>after</i> you because of that?</p> 

<p>JANE: <i>(Looks at Daria uneasily:)</i> Uh--<i>yeah</i>--?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sighs:)</i> Jane, if that were the case, I would've <i>said</i> something by now. Besides, Darren had said the <i>same</i> thing concerning <i>my</i> feelings about you two to <i>me</i>, more or less. I told Darren it was all right with me, and it was <i>no</i> problem, so <i>stop</i> worrying.</p> 

<p>JANE: <i>(Sounding pleased, wipes her forehead:) Great</i>! I'm glad everything's cool.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:) Not</i> quite.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Now confused:)</i> Huh?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Points down:)</i> You know I think your paintings are <i>cool</i>, but what, pray tell, was the deal with that <i>"fuzzy-wuzzy"</i> pro-family <i>crap</i> that you painted downstairs that's hanging up in the living room? I know you said it was a <i>gift</i>, but why'd you have to paint me with my arm <i>hooking</i> Darren's? <i>(Daria pauses, shrugs--Jane can tell that Daria's not <b>too</b> serious in her tone:)</i> Why even paint <i>me</i> at all?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks, in her "motherly" tone:) Now, now, dearie--(resumes her normal tone:)</i> I had to get in <i>good</i> with your folks over Darren, right? I had to swallow my <i>pride</i> to do that, and so I wanted to project the image of a <i>family</i>--and low and behold, it <i>worked</i>! <i>(Daria rolls her eyes, while Jane gets a wicked smirk, and speaks in a faux-mocking tone)</i> C'mon--you're gonna tell me that you <i>didn't</i> like to be seen beside a brother that's told you he's <i>proud</i> of his <i>"Little Sister"</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Narrows her eyes, reluctant:)</i> Oh, no you <i>don't</i>--you're <i>not</i> going to hit my <i>soft</i> spot over Darren--I mean, I have a <i>hard-boiled</i> reputation, and I can't afford to get <i>weak-kneed</i> and <i>jelly-backed</i> over a fellow sibling--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Cuts her off, sensing something:)</i> --A fellow sibling that's willing to <i>be</i> there for his middle sister, who's willing to help both of his sisters in their future endeavors. A <i>genuinely</i> nice guy--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Holds up her hands:)</i> --Ease up there, <i>"Booster Girl"</i>, I get the <i>point. (Pauses:)</i> Okay, I gotta admit, Darren's a--<i>teriffic</i> bro. He sort of --has this--<i>soothing</i> effect on people. <i>(Hesitates, her voice grows <b>very</b> low, looks around, leans over to Jane:)</i> Did you know that when I first told him when you and Tom officially broke up, that I--I--almost--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Leans over to Daria, listens intently:) Yeeess--</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Now almost in a whisper, red-faced:) --ItriedtocomforthimbecausehefeltkindofguiltyforthinkinghebrokeyouandTomup.</i></p>


     <p>Jane stared at Daria, slack-jawed, then she began to giggle--<i>loudly</i>. Daria gave her a <i>piercing</i> glare.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Covers her mouth, still giggles:) You</i> tried to <i>comfort</i> Darren? <i>(Playfully sneers:)</i> Ohhh, that's <i>soooo</i> cute--does this mean that you're going to <i>join</i> the rest of the human race?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan, frowns:)</i> I suppose so--it's too bad that <i>you're</i> going to have to <i>leave</i> the rest of the human race after I <i>choke the crap</i> out of you. <i>(She starts to put her hands around Jane's neck, but Jane jumps back, still laughing)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Puts her left hand up to Daria while wiping her eyes with her right hand, and getting her laughter under control:)</i> H-hold it, pard. Seriously, I think it's <i>great</i> that you did that--especially since <i>I</i> was the one that <i>created</i> the kissing situation in the <i>first</i> place. Hell, he's your <i>brother</i>, Daria. I do that with <i>Trent</i>--it's one of the <i>fringe benefits</i> of having an older brother who's there for you, so relax, and <i>enjoy</i> it.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Now back to normal, gives a Mona Lisa smile:)</i> Yeah--he has been there for me--and <i>Quinn</i> as well. Maybe that's what made her feel <i>guilty</i> over trying to take advantage of Darren.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Shakes her head quickly, makes sure she heard Daria right:)</i> Wait a sec--you said Quinn was <i>trying</i> to take advantage of Darren, and she felt <i>guilty</i>, but they've <i>still</i> gone to <i>Cashman's</i> to get her a dress, courtesy of Darren, despite Helen trying to <i>stop</i> them, and Darren <i>insisting</i> that he do so anyway? <i>(Pauses:)</i> What's going on?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Sit down, and I'll explain--</p>


<p><i>(The scene is Cashman's, about an hour later)</i></p>


     <p>Darren sat <i>slumped</i> in a chair, exhausted and bored, while Quinn went through what seemed like a <i>ton</i> of dresses. He simply watched her go into the dressing room in the back to try on yet <i>another</i> dress for him to see if he liked. To Darren, a dress was a dress, even if his (adopted) mother did head Circa Fashions--he was only familiar with the <i>business</i> end of the industry, and had left the design details for the experts. He sighed and looked at his watch. <i>Theresa</i>, the saleswoman who had noticed him the very moment he came in with Quinn, and had <i>personally</i> decided to handle the sale, (much to the chagrin of the other salesladies who wanted to do so, and had stolen glances at Darren when they figured he wasn't looking) came to him with a tray of cookies and tea. She had a <i>dreamy</i> look on her face. Darren caught her look, and <i>groaned</i> to himself--<i>here we go again.</i></p> 


<p>THERESA: <i>(Smiles:)</i> I thought you looked kind of tired, Darren, so I got this tray of cookies and tea for you. We usually do this for our customers, you understand. <i>(Sits down the tray, stares at him:)</i> Do you need anything <i>else</i>? <i>(Thought v.o.: Maybe my <b>phone number</b>?)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks up at her uneasily, smiling, while making the tea:)</i> Uh, no thank you, but if I do, I'll be sure to call you, Theresa.</p>

<p>THERESA: Okay, Darren--be sure to let me know. I'll see if Quinn needs any help. <i>(Leaves reluctantly)</i></p>


     <p>Darren sighed, and munched on a cookie while watching the dressing room. <i>Come on, sis--<b>pleeease</b> let this be the dress you want, because I can feel myself <b>slowly</b> going <b>insane</b>.</i> He thought about Jane again to pass the time. Why <i>did</i> he kiss her like that? Was it perhaps to <i>reassure</i> her that he cared about her after Tom wanted to make sure that Darren would take <i>care</i> of Jane? Maybe he did it out of some sort of <i>relief</i> after Tom <i>himself</i> told Darren that Darren should not feel guilty for liking Jane? Perhaps it was a little of <i>both</i>? Whatever the case, Darren felt <i>alive</i> for the first time in a long while, considering everything that had happened to him in almost the last three months. His birth family. Jane. Things were <i>finally</i> looking up.</p>

     <p>Then he <i>frowned</i> to himself--<i>no they weren't, not at all.</i> There was still the matter of <i>Sanchez</i>, and what he had done, and of <i>"The Lie"</i> he was giving to Daria, the rest of his birth family, and Jane. This had to stop <i>soon</i>. Curtis had already told him that the <i>media</i> were looking for him, the same for Elenor and Claude, and his <i>uncle William</i>. Sooner or later, the media horde would <i>find</i> him, and the secret would be out--what would Jane and the Morgendorffers think <i>then</i> if he did not tell them first? He decided to call Woo tomorrow morning and see if he found anything, for this--this--<i>"waiting"</i> was eating him up from the inside out. He snapped out of his thoughts when a smiling Quinn walked out in a frilly gold silk dress with Theresa. Darren's heart leapt with hope--was this <i>finally</i> the one? He got up and walked over, grinning uneasily.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(In a faux-excited mode:)</i> So, er, Quinn--is this the dress you want? It certainly looks <i>fabulous</i> on you--<i>(adds out of hope that his next remark will convince Quinn:)</i> I think that the gold really brings out the <i>cuteness</i> in your eyes.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Gasps, delighted:)</i> You <i>DO</i>, Darren? <i>(Looks at Theresa:)</i> This is <i>definitely</i> the dress that I want, Theresa. Wrap it up for me, would you?</p> 

<p>THERESA: <i>(Grins:)</i> Very good, Quinn. <i>(Looks to Darren:)</i> Will that be cash or charge?</p>


     <p>Darren suddenly <i>froze</i>. He certainly could use his <i>Northolt Platinum Card</i>, but he chuckled to himself--seeing the name of <i>"Darren Appleton"</i> on his card for the saleslady would obviously expose <i>everything</i>. Nope, <i>cash</i> would be the way to go.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Reaches for his wallet:)</i> Er--cash. How much is it?</p>

<p>THERESA: <i>$800</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Wide-eyed:) EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS</i>?! <i>(Looks down at Quinn:)</i> Quinn, she said <i>$800</i>!</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(With a smile, singy-songy voice:) Daaaaren</i>! It's a Circa <i>Original</i>! Once I show it to the Fashion Club, they'll be <i>so</i> envious! <i>(Pauses when she sees Darren's uncertain reaction, smirks slightly:)</i> Of, course, if you want me to go <i>back</i> and look for something <i>else--(begins to go back)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>NO</i>! I mean--no, that's all right, Quinn--I'll--<i>buy</i> the dress. <i>(Looks in his wallet, has only $200 on hand:)</i> Er, is there an <i>ATM</i> machine around--?</p>

<p>THERESA: Oh, yes, Darren--in the front of the store, right where you came in.</p>

<p>DARREN: Oh yes--now I remember. Thank you, Theresa. I'll be back, Quinn. <i>(Leaves)</i></p>


     <p>Darren walked up to the ATM and after looking around quickly, put his card in and punched the "withdraw" button. He came back with the cash, and purchased the dress, much to Quinn's delight. Both walked out of <i>Cashman's</i> and went back to Darren's car. After getting in, Quinn looked over at her brother.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(Smiles, in a quiet tone:)</i> Thanks, bro. <i>(Reaches over and kisses him on the cheek:)</i> You're <i>everything</i> a sister can hope to have in a brother.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks over to Quinn, grins uneasily:)</i> You're welcome, sis--I hope you take <i>good</i> care of that dress.</p> 

<p>QUINN: <i>(Waves him off:)</i> Nah, don't worry, Darren--I'll be the freakin' <i>envy</i> of everyone at <i>Chez Pierre</i> tonight, and I wanna look my best, so you better believe I'm gonna take care of my dress--<i>count on it.</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> I guess you will. <i>(Starts up the car)</i></p>


     <p>Darren and Quinn arrived back at the Morgendorffers just in time to start getting ready for their "date". In the meantime, Daria and Jane had talked to Darren as he was getting ready as well, trying to get out of him the <i>price</i> of the dress after seeing Quinn show it to Helen and Jake--just out of <i>curiousity</i>. Darren gave a coy smile, and simply told them to ask <i>Quinn</i>--it was a <i>secret</i> between the two. Daria had been tempted to ask Jane to help her to <i>tie up</i> Darren and <i>force</i> the truth out of him, but upon further thought, she figured that would probably <i>please</i> Jane and her wickedly <i>carnal</i> mind. Ah, it could wait 'till later. Darren came down the stairs dressed in his black dress jacket, tan shirt, and black tie and matching pants, with pointed dress shoes. Daria and Jane were sitting on the middle couch watching <i>Sick, Sad World</i> on the main TV in the living room, while Jake was reading the paper and Helen was working on her cases for her return to work tomorrow. Immediately, Jane saw him come down, and looked at him, smirking <i>wickedly</i>. He was <i>handsome. Very</i> handsome--<i>and he's <b>my</b> boyfriend.</i> Even <i>Daria</i> had to admit her brother looked good--though of course, she'd <i>never</i> admit it out loud. Helen gasped, and looked up from her work, and got off the couch. Jake got up, following Helen. Daria and Jane got up as well. They all gathered around him.</p>


<p>HELEN: <i>(Hugs Darren:)</i> Oh, son--you look wonderful!</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Shakes Darren's hand:)</i> Looking good, Big Guy!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Monotone:)</i> You look <i>nice</i>, bro.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Walks up to him, still with that wicked smirk, feels his lapel:) Ummm--baby</i>. You <i>do</i> look <i>fine. (Darren, Jake, and Helen turn red-faced, while Daria rolls her eyes)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smirks at Jane, then looks around:)</i> Thanks, everyone. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Is <i>Quinn</i> ready, yet?</p>


     <p>As if on cue, Quinn came down the stairs in her gold dress, with matching gold slippers, a gold purse, and elbow-length black gloves. Her make-up was added just enough to give her a radiant look. (Her hairstyle was simliar to the one she had in the episode "Just Add Water") She came down in a deliberate, slow walk, stopping dramatically at the bottom of the stairs. Daria and Jane looked at each other and rolled their eyes. They knew that Quinn was <i>eating up</i> this attention, and <i>loving</i> every minute of it. Still, even both had to admit that <i>"Princess Grace"</i> was <i>beautiful</i>--in a <i>sickenly cute</i> sort of way. Privately, Jane found herself actually <i>grateful</i> that Quinn <i>was</i> Darren's sister--otherwise, they would make a <i>dynamite</i> couple. Darren and the others walked up to Quinn.</p>


<p>HELEN: Oh, Quinn, you look lovely! <i>(Tries to hug Quinn)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Flinches:) Muh--oom</i>! I've got make-up an' stuff on me, you know?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> I know, but I'm still proud of the way you look!</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Smiles:)</i> My little girl! <i>(Thinks about hugging her, but decides against it after seeing what Helen went through)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Speechless:) Quinn</i>? Is that really <i>you</i>? <i>(Quinn giggles)</i> You're <i>stunning</i>!</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Now smug:)</i> Yeah, I <i>know</i>!</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Crosses her arms, feels <b>slightly</b> jealous:)</i> Yeah, you do look like a gold <i>bar</i>, or something. <i>(Quinn frowns slightly, while Darren chuckles)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Careful, sis--you don't want to <i>blind</i> everyone with that shiny gold dress in the restaurant--I mean even the waiters there have to earn a living with their <i>fake</i> French accents, and falling over from the <i>glare</i> of your dress in the lights and spilling their contents on other people won't make their job any easier. <i>(Quinn glares at her)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(With "The Look":) Daria--</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Gets the message, deadpan:)</i> Eh, you look like a <i>million</i> bucks, sis.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(After a second, grudgingly accepts:)</i> Thanks, Daria. <i>(Looks at Darren:)</i> Ready to go, bro?</p>

<p>DARREN: If you are, yes.</p> 


     <p>Everyone went to the door, and Quinn went out to the car. Darren was about to go, when Jake suddenly pulled him aside.</p>


<p>JAKE: <i>(Puts something in his hand:)</i> Son, here's some <i>money</i> for something to buy--<i>Chez Pierre</i> is <i>awfully</i> expensive.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks down in his hand:)</i> Oh, no, that's--</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Insistant:)</i> --Now, son--I'm not gonna take no for an answer--show your sister a good time, okay? Don't worry about the time about coming back--I know that you'll <i>protect</i> Quinn.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shrugs, pockets the money:)</i> Well--sure, okay. <i>(Goes to his car, and opens the door for Quinn, who gets in:)</i> Well, I'll see you all. Jane, I'll call you tomorrow morning, and we can go jogging.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Okay, Darren--you two have a good time.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Just don't let Quinn order the <i>whole</i> menu--she'll try out <i>everything</i> under the sun.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Looks out her passenger-side window, frowns:) Daria</i>! That only happened <i>once</i>, and you're <i>never</i> gonna let me forget it!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Isn't that what sisters are <i>for</i>?</p> 

<p>HELEN: Daria, that's quite enough. Have a good time, you two.</p>

<p>DARREN: We will. See you. <i>(Starts up the car, and backs out into the street, leaves)</i></p>


     <p>Helen and Jake went back inside, while Daria and Jane stayed outside.</p>


<p>JANE: Well, I'd better take off--it's getting dark.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Cocks eyebrow:)</i> What? No <i>"Bad Movie Night"</i> tonight?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Grins:)</i> Nah--gonna do some painting. <i>(Wiggles her eyebrows up an down, smirks:)</i> I'm--<i>"inspired"</i> some more.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks, sarcastic:)</i> Gosh, I wonder <i>who</i> caused that? Okay--see you tomorrow--Darren and I can fill you in on the assorted details of Quinn's "wonderful date".</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> Later. <i>(Leaves)</i></p>


     <p>Daria watched her friend leave, then walked back into the house.</p>
