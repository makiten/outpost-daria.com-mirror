<p> Chapter 13 - Individual Pursuits </p>



     <p>Daria sat up propped on her pillow in her nightclothes, writing in her diary(?).</p>


<blockquote><font face="comic sans ms"><p>From the "so-called" diary of one Daria Morgendorffer:</p>


<p>I'm writing in the <u>morning</u> for this entry as opposed to the evening before because I fell asleep last night while watching TV, and waiting for Darren and Quinn to come back from their "date", for I was too tired to write anything when they finally did come in. Mom and Dad had turned in for tomorrow's (or this morning's) return to the daily grind. It was about 12:30 a.m. when Quinn and Darren finally did return, and by chance, I had heard them come in, and I woke up. I was watching a movie--<u>"The Invasion of the Incredible Shrinking Aliens"</u>, an asinine, idiotic piece of 1950's Cold War-era sci-fi tripe that was on TV at the time. Usually I'm with Jane at her place for "Bad Movie Night" on Sunday evenings, but she was feeling "inspired" artistically by her new boyfriend, who happens to be my brother--I'm <u>still</u> getting used to that--Darren being Jane's boyfriend now, as well as Darren being mine (and Quinn's) Big Bro, and mom and dad's son. I wanted to find out if my sister had worn out my poor Big Bro, and if the date had become a disaster for Quinn while they were at the "phoney-baloney" French cusine <u>garbage</u> restaurant "Chez Pierre"--I could only hope it fell flat for "Queen Quinn"--after all, causing bad things to happen to Quinn is one of the joys of my hellish existence. As they came upstairs, I looked out into the hallway seeing Quinn hugging and kissing Darren on the cheek, thanking him for a good time. I motioned Darren to come to my room, while "Her Highness" had retired for the night, alarmingly with a smile on her face. Crap--I had a feeling that this wasn't going to be good news.</p>

<p>My fears were well-founded. Darren told me the moment he and Quinn went into Chez Pierre arm-in-arm, they became the <u>center</u> of attention. When they sat down at what I call "Quinn's Table", (the reserved table where Quinn always sat with her dates--I overheard her mention it once to her fashion "colleagues") several waiters <u>immediately</u> tried to serve them, and a <u>fight</u> almost occurred between the waiters. Darren said Quinn asked them to stop while she was giggling--ah, that's our Quinn--she's getting back into the groove, what, with all those drooling idiots falling all over her like that. Too bad it wasn't an <u>anvil</u> that could've fallen on <u>her</u> instead.</p>

<p>Things only grew <u>worse</u> from there--from <u>my</u> point of view, that is. Darren said several guys that Quinn apparently knew (he told me she must have, because she had said <u>all</u> of their names), had come over to their table and had asked Darren if he would give them "permission" to date Quinn. Needless to say, a stunned Big Bro looked over at a smiling Quinn, who was the one that gave the "yes" nod, and there was a loud cheer from the guys--oh well, look for the "Boy Express" to return to our house by tonight--much to my consternation. Of course, the girls who were with the guys didn't like that one iota, but their fears were immediately lost when they first eyed my brother, for they started to <u>swoon</u> over him. Darren quickly said that he already had a girlfriend, and that he was only taking his sister Quinn out to just "hang out" together--too bad he couldn't hang Quinn <u>while</u> he was out. The disappointed girls, furious that they could be dumped for Quinn by their dates, while they couldn't score with my Big Bro, turned their anger out on their dates, and promptly chased out and beat their guys from Chez Pierre--after the manager made them come back and pay, of course.</p>

<p>Darren told me he ordered the meal in French, since it was a French restaurant--simple enough. When I think of it, it's not much of a surprise, since Darren's major is Business Administration, and he'd need to know a foriegn language or two for travelling to other countries while on business. Too bad the fake-accent waiters didn't know what in the hell he was saying, so he changed it to English, and ordered "Escalope De Veau"--French for scallops. Quinn, meanwhile, ordered the most expensive item on the menu--(surprise, surprise) "Medaillons De Bceuf Bearnaise"--beef with yellow sauce. I hope that extra money that I saw dad slip to Darren came in handy. Darren told me they talked about the Fashion Institute, and Quinn actually <u>was</u> listening to what he had to say--the only problem I saw with that was if what came out of Darren's mouth just didn't go into my dear sister's hollow little head, bounced around in there for awhile, then came right out again. Sure, I think Quinn's actually beginning to understand what she's going have to do with her life once high school is over and even that she's starting to actually get serious about her schoolwork, but do I really think she'd listen to Darren while enjoying herself? I dunno. Darren is ever the <u>optimist</u>--maybe I can break him of that particularly <u>nasty</u> habit--if I can't, then maybe <u>Jane</u> can.</p>

<p>Anyway, afterwards, he and Quinn went to a movie, a sudden last-minute "addition" that Quinn conned our Big Bro out of--it was the Tom Hanks movie <u>"The Green Mile"</u>, a three hour-plus film. Maybe sis is beginning to have some taste in "deep" movies--either that, or she just wants to "die" when she sees Hanks on the big screen--at least that what she squeals about with her fellow fashion dunces when she has them over for one of their regular air-headed fashion sessions. Darren said that Quinn cried through some of the picture--now if I can only get her to cry when I threaten to torch her clothes one day in front of her "so-called" fashion friends, I can die in peace.</p>

<p>Overall, I suppose it was good for Quinn to get out and be with Darren--I get my turn today when he comes back from jogging with Jane this morning. I think a trip to the arcade is in order, plus a pizza, and then the library--I wonder if Jane would want to go with us? It'll be good to be with her again after she took her "bonding" vacation with her mom. Darren looked happy for Quinn's having a good time when he came back with her--but for some reason, I can't shake the fact that something's bugging him. He looked kind of distracted when he left my room last night--I asked if something was wrong, and he quickly played it off. I guess he's probably thinking about what he did with Jane yesterday--I guess I can't blame him--that was one hell of a kiss he gave her. Damn it--I'm happy for them, but why do I see when they get together, it seems like it reminds me of what it could've been with me and Trent, or even--T--no, I'd best not even <u>attempt</u> to go through that, even if he is "free" now. As for Trent,I'm <u>largely</u> over my crush on him--but I still get a damn small <u>lump</u> in my chest when I think about him once in awhile, though I'm <u>sure</u> I'm <u>completely</u> over him--even though Jane's occasional lapses into the yenta realm certainly doesn't help matters too much either. When she was with--Tom, she cut waaay back on her little love-matching schemes--hmmm, I wonder if she's going to try and influence Big Bro on matching up me and Trent? I shudder at that thought. Maybe I should address the little issue over Trent sometime in the future before Jane does something that will embarass me and her brother--and possibly in a way, Darren as well. At least Trent seems to finally be going in the right direction with his music career by actually moving forward on it--thanks to that "Mysterious Benefactor's" $8,000 contribution--I wonder who he or she is? What do they want from Trent and Mystik Spiral? Surely there's gotta be a catch? Ah--maybe Darren's right--maybe he or she just want to see the group succeed. Hell, I suppose anything's possible. Signing off to another hell-filled day--well, at least Big Bro and Jane are there to help share it with me.</p></font></blockquote>


     <p>Daria smirked, and put her diary(?) and pen back into her strongbox, and locked it. After putting it back into her closet and placing her glasses on her dresser drawer, she shuffled over to her bed, and plopped down face-first in her pillow. The moment she began to snore lightly, there was a gentle knocking on her door. Daria flinched slightly while staying face-down.</p>


<p>VOICE: <i>(While knocking:)</i> Daria, hello, Daria! Are you awake?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sounding muffled in her pillow:)</i> If I wasn't then, I am <i>now. (Pauses:)</i> Is this <i>20</i> questions? If so, the answer from 1 to 20 is a resounding <i>no</i>.</P>


     <P><I>Helen</I> walked in, leaving the door open, dressed in her red power suit. She came over to Daria's bed and stood beside it, placing her hands on her hips. Daria stayed in her face-down position while Helen talked.</p>


<p>HELEN: Daria, your father and I are about to leave for work. We're going to need you to go downstairs and let Darren in when he comes back from jogging, sweetie--<i>(smirks:)</i> unless you want to get up from your <i>"comfortable"</i> bed and go downstairs when you hear the doorbell ring.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Now turns over to look at her mother, props her head on her right hand, leans on her right elbow, sighs:)</i> Didn't dad say that he was gonna get a <i>key</i> for Darren this weekend?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Sighs herself, exasperated:) Yes</i>, but you know how your father's memory can <i>slip</i> from time to time--</p>


     <p><i>Jake</i>, dressed for work in his usual business suit, walked by Daria's door at the <i>very</i> instant Helen had uttered that statement, and walked in, frowning--was she <i>implying</i> that he was growing <i>old</i>?</p>


<p>JAKE: <i>Honey</i>! <i>(Points at his head:)</i> My memory's as sharp as a <i>tack</i>! I don't remember you telling me about our son needing a darn key!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Glares at Jake, talks through clenched teeth:)</i> I most certainly <i>did</i> tell you, Jake! It was this past Friday! I <i>distinctly</i> asked you to get a key for Darren while you were out on vacation!</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Glares back at Helen:)</i> No, you didn't! You said that Darren <i>might</i> need a key! You didn't say so for <i>sure</i>! <i>(Smug, crosses his arms, thinks he has one over Helen for a change:) Ha</i>!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Stares at Jake in mild disbelief, arms spread out:)</i> What in the <i>hell</i> is the <i>damn</i> difference, Jake?! It's the <i>same</i> thing!</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Raises his voice:)</i> No, it <i>isn't</i>!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Her voice now raising also:)</i> Yes, it <i>is</i>!</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Draws his face closer to Helen's:) Is NOT</i>!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Ditto:) Is TOO</i>!</p>


   <p>Daria went back down on her bed face first and put her pillow over her head to try and block out the shouting. Bad enough that they were hollering in the middle of her <i>"inner sanctum"</i> with her <i>in</i> it, but to make matters worse, her parents were arguing like a couple of <i>children</i> over a <i>stupid</i> little key. This was <i>not</i> happening--things could not <i>possibly</i> get any worse.</p>

     <p> Of course, she was <i>wrong</i>. A clearly-not-appearing-like-herself, tired-looking and frowning, frazzled <i>Quinn</i>, dressed in her nightclothes, came from the hallway into Daria's room, and shouted:</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>MUH--OOM! DA--AAD! YOU GUYS <b>KNOW</b> THAT I NEED MY <b>DAMN</b> BEAUTY SLEEP! IF I DON'T GET IT, I'LL GET <b>WRINKLES</b>! I MEAN, WE'VE LIKE GONE OVER THIS A <B>MILLION</B> TIMES ALREADY! WHY DON'T YOU TWO TAKE THE FREAKIN' ARGUMENT DOWNSTAIRS, OKAY?! (Leaves to go back to her room)</i></p>


     <p>A stunned Helen and Jake looked at each other, and then at Daria, who had come out from under the pillow during Quinn's tirade, also stunned as well. After a tense moment, Jake spoke in a sheepish, quiet tone:</p>


<p>JAKE: Er, I'll get the key during lunch--I promise. <i>(Adds after a moment:) Sorry</i> about shouting at you, honey.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(In the same tone:)</i> It's--all right, Jakey--and I'm sorry I shouted at you, too. <i>(Looks at Daria:)</i> We're sorry for coming in your room and shouting like that, sweetie.</p>

<p>JAKE: Yeah, Kiddo--it won't happen again. <i>(Looks around, now his chipper, lovable, clueless self:) Wow</i>! What have you done to your <i>room</i>, Daria? It looks like it's been <i>redecorated</i>!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sighs:)</i> It's <i>always</i> been like that, Dad. <i>(Thought v.o.: You just haven't noticed because you visit in here every <b>six months</b> or so.)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Pulls Jake along by the arm:)</i> Come <i>on</i>, Jake--we've got to get to work. Goodbye, sweetie. <i>(Both leave Daria's room, shutting the door)</i></p>


     <p>Daria got off her bed, retrieved her glasses off of the dresser drawer and put them on, went back to her closet, and took out the strongbox that contained her diary(?). She unlocked the strongbox, took out the diary(?), opening it up to the entry she had just completed, and laid it on the bed. She took the pen and crossed <i>out</i> the part about an "anvil" falling on Quinn.</p> 


<p>DARIA: <i>(With a Mona Lisa smile, thought v.o.: <b>There</b>. I figured I owed Quinn for getting mom and dad out of my room--now we're <b>"even"</b>.) (Puts diary[?] back into the strongbox and locks it, and places it back into her closet.)(Thought v.o.: All of that damn shouting's got me <b>fully</b> awake now--might as well stay up and wait for Darren to come back.) (Goes out of her room)</i></p>


<p><i>(Scene changes to a street outside in the early-morning light)</i></p> 


     <p>Darren and Jane were jogging together near the Gupty's house on their way back, and had stopped to stretch, having been out for about an hour. During that time, Darren had told Jane about his "date" with Quinn. Jane simply shook her head at the events he described, and chuckled.</p> 


<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks while stretching:)</i> So Quinn's back in the <i>"boy-getting business"</i>, eh?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles, doing the same:)</i> If you mean by having the boys <i>"catering to her whims"</i>, I'd say yes. She's promised me, however, that she'll keep the number of boys that she'll date down to a minimum of <i>three</i> a week. <i>(Shrugs, smiles sheepishly, while Jane arches an eyebrow at this, and smirks:)</i> Yeah, yeah, I know--but it's a <i>start</i>. At least she's happy again, I guess.</p>

<p>JANE: I guess. <i>(Her smirk slowly fades, hesitates:)</i> So, um--you said that those girls at <i>Chez Pierre "crowded"</i> around you? <i>(Darren nods while taking deep breaths, and Jane stops stretching:)</i> You didn't feel the least bit, uh--<i>attracted</i> to <i>any</i> one of them?</p>


     <p>Darren now stopped his stretching and stared at Jane with a puzzled look on his face.</p>


<p>DARREN: What do you mean, Jane?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Looks a little uncomfortable, goes on reluctantly:)</i> Well--you <i>are</i> attractive, Darren--and from what I can recall with what happened at the Zen the other night with those Goth girls, uh, <i>pursuing</i> you, you've had--<i>quite</i> a few members of the opposite sex making <i>eyes</i> at you, and--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Puts up his hand:) --Wait</i> a moment, Jane--<i>where</i> is this conversation going? I thought I made it <i>clear</i> yesterday that I really <i>care</i> about you, and you <i>only. (Jane blushes slightly)</i> As I told you and Daria the other night, I'm <i>not</i> interested in <i>other</i> girls. I've seen what happens when guys who think they're <i>"God's gift to women"</i> go after <i>all</i> the girls--they leave a lot of broken hearts in their wake, and it's just not <i>worth</i> it. <i>(Pauses, looks uneasy:)</i> Are you--are you having <i>second</i> thoughts about us? Don't tell me that you're feeling--<i>insecure</i>--?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Now slightly frantic, her eyes wide-open:) NO</i>! I mean--<i>no</i> way, bub! I'm <i>definitely</i> attracted to you. I'm <i>secure</i> with being with you! <i>(Goes up to Darren, speaks low, puts her hands on his sweaty chest, smiles, speaks in a low voice:)</i> I'm just wondering why someone like <i>me</i> could be so <i>damn</i> lucky to find a nice, handsome, <i>honest (Darren winces to himself over <b>that</b> word)</i> guy like you. <i>(Looks down:)</i> I know that I might not look as <i>good</i> as those other girls--<i>(Darren rolls his eyes, slowly shakes his head)</i> wait, hear me out--I mean compared to <i>Quinn</i> last night, if <i>I</i> went out with you to <i>Chez Pierre</i>, not that I would want to go to a place like that, mind you--it might kind of--well--<i>(looks away:) drag</i> you <i>down</i>, or something.</p>


     <p>Darren tilted Jane's chin up to him and softly chuckled. Jane blushed and smiled as she looked up into his deep blue eyes.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(In a quiet tone, chuckles:)</i> Jane, do you remember what you told Daria the other night while we were on our way to the <i>Zen</i> about "nice-looking people" like myself? <i>(Jane stares at him for a moment, slowly nods in realization:)</i> Good--I'm with <i>you</i>, and <i>not</i> them. That should tell you <i>something. (Then, before Jane can say anything else, he kisses her, holding her around her waist, while Jane has her hands on his chest, then he stops:) Still</i> harboring any doubts?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Gets that dreamy look again:) Uh-uh. (Shakes her head quickly to get out of the trance, changes subject:)</i> So, ah, you and Daria are gonna spend some time together painting the town red when you get back home, eh?</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gently caresses Jane's face:)</i> Yes, though I don't know what she has planned yet.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Looks up, smirks:)</i> Hmmm--lemme guess--knowing her, I'd say--the <i>arcade, pizza</i>, and the <i>library</i>--yeah, that about covers it.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Grins, shrugs:)</i> Good--I like <i>all</i> of those places to relax and hang out. In fact, we went once to the library since I've been here.</p>

<p>JANE: Yeah, me too--<i>except</i> the library. Daria loves to read there, but that's not my gig, so when she does go, I'm <i>not</i> there, save to maybe get a book about art, or something. <i>(Notices Darren looking at her, curiously, cocking his head:)</i> Hey, libraries <i>bore</i> me--they're too--<i>(shudders:) confining</i>.</p>  


<p><i>(Note to reader: Is it just me, or does it seem that when Daria does go into the library, high school or local, she does so <b>without</b> Jane in tow? My opinion only, and as a result until proven different, will remain in the story.)</i></p>


<p>DARREN: Ah, I see--<i>(pauses, smirks:)</i> so, what do <i>you</i> plan to do on this fine Monday?</p>

<p>JANE: I dunno. Maybe hang out at home and do some art, whatever. I've got nothing planned.</p>

<p>DARREN: Say, why don't you <i>join</i> Daria and me? I'm sure she wouldn't mind you coming along with us.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> Are you <i>sure</i> about that, Darren? I wouldn't want to be a <i>third</i> wheel, or anything.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks at Jane with mild disbelief:) Why</i> would you say that?</p> 

<p>JANE: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> I guess it's because since you spent time with Quinn last night, it would be only <i>fair</i> if you did the same thing with Daria the next day.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> Quinn's <i>different</i>--she seems to require my <i>complete</i> attention--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:)</i> --And everyone <i>else's</i>--</p>

<p>DARREN: --but Daria wouldn't mind <i>sharing</i> me with you. Besides, you've been out of town for almost three weeks--that and the fact that she and I <i>have</i> spent a little time together while you were on vacation. I'm sure she'd like to see her friend, too.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Ponders:)</i> Weeeeell--<i>okay. (Darren smiles)</i> Now, c'mon--we've got a jog to finish! <i>(Smirks wickedly, suddenly takes off in a full, playful run from Darren:)</i> Catch me if you can, slowpoke!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Grins:)</i> Hey, no fair! <i>C'mere you--(goes after her)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to William Appleton's Park Avenue apartment)</i></p>



     <p>William Appleton, still dressed in his pajamas and housecoat, was talking on the phone while sitting at the dining room table to Benny, who had called. William was eating a continental breakfast of pancakes topped with strawberries and whipped cream, bacon and eggs, hash browns, orange juice, and coffee that was prepared by a just recently-departed special chef, whom he had hired just for such an occasion <i>every</i> morning. William had an <i>intense</i> look of curiousity on his face.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: --And you're <i>sure</i> about this, Benny? Your source told you that the NTSB will announce that the crash we arranged will be ruled an <i>accident</i>? I thought for sure it would take <i>months</i> for them to make such a ruling.</p>

<p>BENNY: Well, Boss--my source said that the investigators listened to the tape on the Black Box they recovered from the crash site, and decided by hearing the <i>frantic</i> conversation between the pilots and what they did to try and keep the jet from crashing, that a busted fuel line was the cause, <i>period</i>. The evidence was <i>overwhelming</i>. They'll announce it this morning at the Peerdale Hotel downtown. <i>(Voice becomes excited:)</i> We're <i>home free</i>, Boss!</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Rolls his eyes, frowns, grits his teeth, and shouts:)</i> Benny, you <i>moron</i>, we're not off the hook yet! <i>(Calms down:)</i> We've still got to locate <i>Sanchez</i>, who I'm assuming will be calling you after the NTSB's findings, and asking for the second part of his <i>"fee"</i>.</p>

<p>BENNY: Hey, that's <i>right</i>! <i>(William slowly shakes his head, privately wondering if Benny has <b>any</b> brain in his head)</i> I guess I should be waiting by the phone at work when he does. <i>(Pauses:)</i> What about your <i>"nephew"</i>? With Constance Waters going <i>bon voyage</i> to Japan, and now this--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Cuts him off:)</i> --As I <i>told</i> you, Benny--we'll do <i>nothing</i> until and unless we know for a <i>certainty</i> that he suspects <i>me</i> of being involved with his <i>"parent's"</i> deaths, <i>(pauses:)</i> and in a possible <i>connection</i> to that, we hear what <i>Woo's</i> been up to, don't forget that either. You just make sure that our man we have for Darren is ready at the <i>moment</i> we need him, got that? I'll meet you at work in an hour. <i>(Curtly hangs up the phone, stares out of the window at the Manhattan skyline, frowning, thought v.o.: <b>Soon</b>, my "nephew"--very soon, I'll take care of you once and for all. You'll end up in the <b>ground</b> like your "parents", and I'll <b>"rule the roost"</b> like I <b>deserve</b> to.)</i></p> 



<p><i>(Scene changes to the Morgendorffer's, about 30 minutes later)</i></p>



     <p>Daria, who had been watching the morning news on the small TV in the kitchen and was now dressed in her customary attire, opened the front door to allow Darren in.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(While coming in:)</i> Thanks, sis.</p>

<p>DARIA: No prob, bro. How was your jog with Jane? <i>(Goes back to the kitchen, followed by Darren)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles:)</i> It was--<i>pleasant. (Daria arches an eyebrow at the way he says it)</i> We really covered a lot of ground.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> I'll just <i>bet</i> you guys did. <i>(Darren turns red-faced, looks away uneasily, slightly embarassed)</i> Will you be ready to go with me about 10:00 this morning? That's when the <i>Mr. Fun's Exciting World of Games</i> arcade will be open.</p>

<p><i>(Note to reader: This was what Lawndale's main arcade hangout was called--see the episode "The New Kid", and in "The Daria Database"--though in the book, Daria writes it as "Mr. Fun's World of Games")</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Thought v.o.: So Jane <b>was</b> right on the money! No surprise there, I suppose, she being Daria's friend and all:)</i> The arcade you say? Sure, I'll be ready then. <i>(Sees TV on:)</i> Is the morning news on yet?</p> 

<p>DARIA: Nope--it'll be on in about a minute, or so.</p>

<p>DARREN: Good. Oh, I wanted to ask if it was all right if <i>Jane</i> came along with us. <i>(Hesitates, looks at Daria a little uneasily:)</i> Would that be all right with you?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(While pouring some cereal in a bowl on the bar counter in the kitchen, and while Darren gets another bowl and puts it beside Daria's:)</i> Sure. <i>(Stops, cocks an eyebrow:)</i> Um--why <i>wouldn't</i> it be all right with me?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shrugs while getting the box of cereal from Daria, who's getting the milk out of the refrigerator:)</i> Well--for <i>some</i> reason, Jane seemed to think that you'd feel that she would be getting in the <i>way</i> of us having a good time together. I told her that you and I had spent some time with each other while she was on vacation, and that you'd want to see her, since she's your friend. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Er--did I kind of <i>"jump the gun"</i>, there?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(After a moment:)</i> I--<i>appreciate</i> that, bro--and no, what you said was cool--<i>(now surprised:)</i> Jane actually <i>said</i> that? <i>(Pours milk on her cereal:)</i> Why in the <i>hell</i> would she think such a thing? <i>(Gives milk to Darren)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Pauses, frowns, perplexed:)</i> Now when I think about it, maybe <i>she's</i> thinking that since she and I are now seeing each other, it might make you feel like--well, she was intruding on your and my time together.</p>  

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sits down and eats at the kitchen bar with Darren:)</i> That's <i>nuts</i>--Jane's my friend. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Maybe she's thinking it would be like the way I was when she first met Tom. I was a real pain in the <i>ass</i> to him because--<i>(hesitates:)</i> I felt he was <i>taking</i> Jane's time away from me. Jane felt that she had became caught in the middle of our little <i>"tug-of-war"</i>. Eventually, Tom and I came to an--<i>(hesitates:) understanding</i>, and all was right with the world--I had to get used to the fact that my <i>"Partner In Crime"</i> had a boyfriend, and she'd want to spend some of her time with him too. In a way, it's <i>ironic</i>--irony being something that I'm supposed to <i>appreciate</i> now, mind you--<i>(Darren chuckles)</i> I had just gotten <i>used</i> to Tom, and then <i>this</i> happens--go figure. <i>(Smirks, pauses:)</i> I guess I'll have to get used to it <i>again</i>, huh?</p>


     <p>Darren gave a serious stare at Daria for a moment, then put down his spoon. Daria stopped eating and stared back at him, wondering what was up.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(In a sincere tone:)</i> Daria, I hope that you'll <i>never</i> feel that Jane and I would take any time <i>away</i> from you. <i>(Pauses:)</i> If you <i>ever</i> feel that way, <i>please</i> let us know, okay? I don't want there to be any <i>problem</i> that might arise between any of us over something like this. <i>(Reaches over and absentmindedly puts a reassuring hand on a now-surprised Daria's hand, which makes her <b>freeze</b> and look at it, then Darren suddenly notices what he's done, and <b>snatches</b> his hand away, looks at it with his eyes <b>wide</b> open:) Daria</i>, oh, er--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Recovers quickly from her shock, becomes reassuring:)</i> --I--um--it's--<i>okay</i>, bro. I'm--not used to, you know--<i>contact. (Thought v.o.: Though I <b>initiated</b> it the other night when you felt guilty about thinking you unwittingly helped break up Tom and Jane when she kissed you in the Zen--<b>damn</b> conscience.) (Gives a rare, small chuckle:)</i> I'm not <i>fragile</i>, you know--I won't <i>break</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gives his own, uneasy chuckle:)</i> N-no, o-of course not. <i>(Looks at the TV to ease the tension and change the subject:)</i> Hey, the morning news is coming on.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Follows his lead:)</i> Um--yeah--let's see if the <i>missiles</i> have been <i>released</i> yet. <i>(Darren snickers)</i></p>


     <p>The morning news opened with the snazzy, important-sounding music, then a a perky-looking man and woman was on camera at the Channel Four morning news set, with the <i>fake</i> living room background. Both did those <i>annoyingly</i> cliched greetings to one another (to Daria it was like that, at least), and then faced the camera, smiling those <i>forced</i> smiles.</p>


<p>TV ANCHORWOMAN: --And good morning, everyone, welcome to <i>Morningtime. (A picture of the Appleton Industries logo appears in the upper left corner of the screen)</i> In a surprising late-breaking story, we've just received some information from our newsources that the National Transportation Safety Board will be announcing their findings concerning the crash of the private jet that carried the late Lucille and Arthur Appleton Sr., the parents of Arthur Appleton Jr., who has not been seen since the funeral of his parents. <i>(Darren's eyes grow wide in shock, and Daria casually notices his reaction)</i> The press conference will be held at about 9:30 a.m. in the main meeting room of the <i>Peerdale Hotel</i> in New York City. There has been no word over what the NTSB will say. In a related development, Appleton Industries has just announced that its Energy Division Chief, <i>Constance Waters</i>, will be transferred to <i>Japan. (Darren's mouth drops in shock, Daria picks this up as well)</i> Waters, who pulled off a stunning business coup by acquiring a sizable share in the Tsunama/Fuju Japanese energy company for Appleton Industries, was considered to be an up-and-coming name at Appleton. A spokesman for William Appleton said, quote: <i>"Constance Water's trip to Japan will ensure a smooth transition into the Far Eastern market for Appleton Industries--this is a golden opportunity for Waters to show her 'stuff'"</i>, unquote. In other news--</p>


     <p>Darren looked off, frowning, deep in thought. Daria sneaked a glance at her brother while she was eating her cereal. After about 10 seconds of silence, she spoke.</p>


<p>DARIA: Er, your cereal's gonna get soggy if you don't eat it, bro.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Snaps out of it:) Hmmm--</i>? Oh, you're right--let me finish it. <i>(Starts to eat it hastily)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(After a moment:)</i> Um--I couldn't help seeing how you <i>were</i> when it was announced that the NTSB was going to release their findings on that jet plane crash that killed those Appleton people. <i>(Darren freezes, concerned, tries to keep his reaction to Daria in check)</i> I guess it was pretty <i>quick</i> for them to find the cause of it, huh? <i>(Darrens sighs to himself in relief, nods)</i> Usually, it'll take from a few months up to a <i>year</i> or more for the NTSB to make their ruling on a crash like that.</p>

<p>DARREN: I--suppose. They certainly did find out what happened sooner than everyone thought--I guess the Black Box they recovered gave them all the information they needed, huh? <i>(Keeps eating, but doing so in a slower fashion, still thinking to himself)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> I guess. <i>(Stares at him some more, then:)</i> What do you think of what happened to that <i>Waters</i> woman? <i>(Darren cuts his eyes at Daria, alarmed)</i></p> 

<p>DARREN: What--do you mean, Daria?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shows a little of her sarcasm, mock ponders, looks up with a finger on her chin, deadpan:) Hmmm</i>--I've just worked my <i>female executive ass</i> off for my company, enabling them to get a <i>hell</i> of a large share of a foriegn company that apparently my company has <i>drooled</i> after for a certain amount of time, and to show their so-called <i>"gratitude"</i>, they ship me off <i>halfway</i> around the damn world. <i>(In an ironic tone:)</i> What a <i>wonderful</i> way to advance up the corporate ladder--I suppose the <i>old</i> way of getting ahead--you know, <i>"being in <b>'bed'</b> together"</i> can be thrown out now?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Arches an eyebrow:)</i> Can you <i>"elaborate"</i> a little <i>further</i> on that, sis?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Darren, since business administration <i>is</i> your major, I'll put this question to you--if <i>you</i> were the <i>head</i> of a corporation, and the person who worked under you, in this case, a <i>female</i>, did a great job for your company, would you <i>award</i> her by sending her off someplace else?</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Narrows his eyes slightly, thinks:)</i> No, of course not--I'd <i>probably</i> consider promoting her.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Now raises her own eyebrow:) "Probably"</i>, bro? You mean you wouldn't promote her right there on the <i>spot</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> It <i>depends</i>, Daria--if it were as you say, something <i>major</i> that my company really wanted for a long while, sure, in an <i>instant</i>. If it were something <i>minor</i>, I'd mark it down on her record for future advancement.</p> 

<p>DARIA: There--you've <i>proven</i> my point--and this <i>wasn't</i> something that was major?</p> 


     <p>Darren looked off in space, considering his sister's words.</p>


<p>DARREN: Okay, you're <i>right</i>, it <i>was</i> major. <i>(Adds after a moment:)</i> Are you <i>implying</i> that the head of Appleton Industries is some sort of <i>sexist</i> for not promoting her, and the only way <i>Co</i>--er, <i>Ms. Waters</i> could have been promoted is to get in <i>bed</i>, with--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shakes her head slowly, cuts him off:)</i> --I wouldn't go <i>that</i> far, bro--at least not <i>yet</i>, anyway. I just think it's kind of <i>unfair</i> and <i>strange</i> that this happened like that, that's all. <i>(Shrugs:)</i> But then, what do <i>I</i> know? <i>(Returns to eating her cereal)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Thought v.o., now looks at Daria seriously: Apparently a <b>whole</b> lot, sis--and not just because you're intelligent.:)</i> I guess it <i>was</i> unfair and strange at that. <i>(Pauses, gives Daria a determined stare:)</i> Look, <i>I</i> would <i>never</i> discriminate against anyone, Daria, and I wouldn't tolerate any <i>garbage</i> like that in <i>my</i> company from <i>any</i> of my subordinates if I were the head---you could <i>count</i> on that.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Chews, looks at Darren with her deadpan expression:)</i> Glad to <i>hear</i> that, bro--of course, I never <i>said</i> that you <i>would</i>.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles uneasily after seeing how he overreacted to Daria's statement:)</i> Ah, of <i>course</i> not. <i>(Finishes wolfing down his cereal:)</i> Well, I'd better shower and dress, sis. I'll see you then. <i>(Puts bowl in sink, pauses, mentions in an off-handed way:)</i> Er, since the NTSB seemed to have already drawn a conclusion as to what has happened to those--<i>"Appleton"</i> people so quickly, I'm curious as to know <i>how</i> they reached their findings. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Do you mind if we watch <i>some</i> of that news conference before we go?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(After a moment:)</i> No, I don't mind--now that you've mentioned it, I'm kind of curious <i>myself</i>. I guess we can wait for a few extra minutes.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gives a quick, quiet smile:)</i> Thanks, sis. <i>(Leaves the kitchen)</i></p>


     <p>Daria watched him leave with a slight frown on her face, perplexed.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Thought v.o.: Something about that report really <b>spooked</b> Darren. I'm guessing that it somehow hit <b>close</b> to home concerning his adopted parents. Did <b>they</b> die in a plane crash, too, or some sort of <b>similar</b> accident? He never said <b>how</b> they died yet, or <b>when</b>, and no one around here has tried to ask him about it <b>directly</b>, even when our grandmothers and aunts were here. I guess everyone was so glad he was <b>alive</b>, they didn't give a damn about how he came to us--not that I could <b>blame</b> them, I suppose. Should I--? <b>No</b>. If I did, it might <b>"alienate"</b> him for some reason--best let him tell us when he's good and ready.) (Keeps eating, then stops, thought v.o.: I <b>don't</b> want to alienate my bro? Did I really just think <b>that</b> to myself? Crap, I <b>am</b> getting softer and softer--my mind's about to <b>go</b>.) (Closes her eyes, shakes her head rapidly as if to get the thought out of her mind, then keeps eating)</i></p>


     <p>Darren went up the stairs full of questions. What would the NTSB <i>say</i> about the crash? What would the person or persons who hired Sanchez <i>do</i> after watching what the NTSB would say? Would that <i>butcher</i> Sanchez be watching <i>himself</i>? Darren wondered briefly if they would they come after <i>him</i> if the report said that <i>sabotage</i> was the cause, putting his birth family in danger
--possibly even <i>Jane</i>. Woo said that whoever did hire Sanchez did <i>not</i> consider his birth family and friends a <i>threat</i> to them. Still, <i>anything</i> was possible. Should he <i>leave</i> his birth family, going somewhere <i>secretly</i>, telling them that an <i>"emergency"</i> came up, and that he would have to go back home, or something?</p>

     <p><i>No</i>. That sudden little action would likely <i>raise</i> more questions than it would answer. Besides, he was beginning to feel--<i>comfortable</i> with the Morgendorffers, <i>closer</i> to them. He, the <i>cynical</i> Daria, and the <i>"beauty/fashion-obsessed"</i> Quinn were forming a <i>bond</i>, the same with the somewhat <i>autocratic</i> Helen and <i>comically clueless</i> Jake (though he knew both were well-meaning in their parenting). Then, of course, there was <i>Jane</i>. There was something--<i>alluring</i> about her. She certainly had a <i>carefree</i> attitude that was <i>infectious</i>--Darren had not felt so good about himself since Stephanie was alive. He could not put his finger on it, but he did <i>not</i> want to leave Jane, or his birth family hanging like that. It would not be fair to <i>either</i> of them--or to <i>himself</i>. He would have <i>no</i> choice but to wait for Woo's investigation--which reminded him to contact Woo later this morning to see if Woo found anything yet. Darren knew that Woo would probably be watching the news conference, too, and Darren could compare notes with him over the phone. It was still too early in the morning on the West coast--he looked at his alarm clock and it was a little after <i>8:00 a.m.</i> here. Darren decided to take his cell phone <i>with</i> him--he would have to <i>call</i> Woo while he was out with Daria and Jane, but to do so in a <i>discreet</i> manner. He was beginning to <i>hate</i> himself more and more for <i>lying</i> to his birth family and Jane--and to everyone <i>else</i> in and around Lawndale as well. It was <i>not</i> in his nature to do so, and it was <i>gnawing</i> at him. He walked into his room to shower and change with a <i>disgusted</i> look on his face.</p>

     <p>As he came into his room, he then thought about <i>Constance Waters</i>. Daria's question was quite <i>valid</i>--why would his uncle William send her over to <i>Japan</i>? Surely, someone <i>else</i> could have handled Tsunama/Fuju? Darren thought about <i>calling</i> his uncle to ask <i>why</i> he'd do such a thing, but then he remembered his <i>promise</i>--not to question his uncle's decisions concerning the company. After all, Darren did <i>choose</i> William to head Appleton Industries. He suspected that Constance wanted to go of her <i>own</i> accord, probably like <i>Leonard Potter</i> did as well. Speaking of Leonard, Darren decided to <i>call</i> Potter when Darren got back to the mansion after all this <i>madness</i> was over--no need to <i>bother</i> Leonard with him being so <i>busy</i> and all on the West coast. Darren then took out some clothes from his bag, and was about to go into the bathroom when his cell phone, which was connected to its charger on his dresser, rang. He frowned briefly, perplexed, wondering if Curtis was calling again--or maybe Woo <i>had</i> something? A bit nervous, he answered it.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Reluctantly speaks:)</i> Uh, hello?</p>

<p>VOICE: Well, <i>that</i> certainly sounded like a <i>definitive</i> greeting, Darren! Hello, dear nephew!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Now grins, delighted:) Aunt Millie</i>? Hey! <i>(Sits down on his bed, genuinely relieved:)</i> Are <i>you</i> a voice I needed to hear! Where are you? How are you doing?</p>

<p>MILLIE: I'm in <i>London</i> in the <i>Royal Cresent</i> hotel room, Darren--I've had a wonderful time, and I'm doing fine. I'll be back in the States late next week. I wanted to call and hear about how things are going with your birth family, the Morgendorffers. <i>(Darren grows quiet, begins to get deep in thought)</i> How--how have they <i>treated</i> you, since you've been there, dear? I know the <i>last</i> time we talked the night you came there, you really didn't know know them <i>well</i> enough to <i>draw</i> an opinion.</p>

<p>DARREN: Things have gone--<i>well</i> since I last called you, Aunt Millie--I'm starting to form a--<i>bond</i> with my birth family. I've already met my birth aunts and grandmothers too.</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(After a long pause:)</i> That's--that's <i>wonderful</i>, Darren. I'm--<i>glad</i> that you're establishing your <i>ties</i> to them.</p>


<p>Darren sensed his aunt's <i>reluctance</i> over this subject, remembering their conversation over his getting to know the Morgendorffers the night before he left the mansion--she <i>still</i> had her <i>"ridiculous"</i> concerns over him getting <i>closer</i> to them--and possibly <i>leaving</i> her. Instead of saying something he knew would do <i>little to anything</i> that would allay his aunt's feelings and fears, he smiled quietly to himself, hoping that once he <i>introduced</i> her to the Morgendorffers, she would not feel so <i>"threatened"</i> by them.</p> 


<p>MILLIE: <i>(Continues:)</i> What--what was their <i>reaction</i> to the <i>"wealth"</i> issue? <i>(Is heard chuckling uneasily:)</i> For <i>some</i> reason, I half-thought that I'd hear something in the <i>media</i> by now, you know, something like, <i>"Arthur Jr. Meets His Birth Family"--</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Grows slightly pale, then decides to <b>partially</b> tell his aunt the truth:)</i> Uh, Aunt Millie, I really <i>haven't</i> told the Morgendorffers <i>everything</i> about me, yet--especially about how <i>much</i> money I have--</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Sounding stunned, cuts him off:) --What</i>? Why not?</p>

<p>DARREN: I--<i>still</i> want to get to know them a little bit better--that and the <i>"impression"</i> they gave me that they kind of look <i>down</i> on the wealthy--I found that out about my birth mother, father, and sister Daria. <i>Quinn</i>, however, I think, is--a little--<i>(searches for words:) advantageous</i> when it comes to knowing someone that's rich. She said that she wants to <i>know</i> someone that has money. <i>(Thought v.o.: And I can only <b>shudder</b> at the thought when Quinn finds out how much money I have.)</i></p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Now with a concerned tone in her voice:)</i> What did your birth mother say?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> Don't worry, Aunt Millie--I don't think it's all <i>that</i> serious. Let's just say that Helen, who you'll remember is a <i>lawyer</i>, had a bit of a <i>"sour"</i> experience in a case with a <i>rich</i> defendant she was trying to win a lawsuit from. She said that the defendant used their <i>"money and connections"</i>, and <i>"escaped"</i> paying money to her client, the plaintiff.</p> 

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Sounding unsure:)</i> Oh, <i>dear</i>--and I suppose she was quite <i>bitter</i> about the whole thing?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Rolls his eyes, smiles:)</i> If you could've seen her <i>yourself</i>, you'd <i>pray</i> that she wouldn't know that <i>you</i> were rich--at least <i>I</i> did at the time.</p> 

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Gives an unsure chuckle:)</i> I can <i>imagine. (Pauses:)</i> How about your birth father?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sighs:)</i> Actually, not <i>all</i> that different from my birth mother's experience. He has some sort of <i>competition</i> going in his consulting business from a fellow who is <i>more</i> successful than he's been, at least financially, and he's <i>vowed</i> to match up with this guy in clients some day, and <i>beat</i> him out. He says he's going to be <i>richer</i> because of it.</p> 

<p>MILLIE: <i>(After taking everything in Darren has said:)</i> I see. What about your sister <i>Daria</i>? What was <i>her</i> problem with wealth?</p>


     <p>Darren frowned to himself, searching for words, then continued.</p>


<p>DARREN: She basically said that the wealthy used their money <i>"for <b>bribery</b> or <b>kickbacks, self-indulgent extravagance</b>, and <b>an overnight stay in the Lincoln bedroom."</b> (Pauses:)</i> I could say that I <i>felt</i> every word she said hit me like a <i>rock</i>, but she didn't sound too <i>mocking</i> when she said that. You see, Aunt Millie, I learned that Daria has a tendency to hide behind a <i>wall</i> of sarcasm when she speaks--she uses that to also hide her <i>feelings</i> as well, not only <i>verbally</i>, but <i>facially</i>, too--<i>(chuckles:)</i> I think my sister has the <i>"world's greatest poker face".</i></p> 

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Snickering sound:)</i> Hmmm--are you saying that you couldn't <i>tell</i> what she <i>really</i> meant when she criticized those who are wealthy?</p>

<p>DARREN: Well--<i>almost</i>. I'm sure that my having a lot of money would mean <i>nothing</i> to her, but it might make her think a little <i>differently</i> of me, a little more <i>skeptical</i>. Then again, I can't be too sure of <i>that</i>, either--you see, Daria is perhaps the most <i>difficult</i> person to read I have <i>ever</i> met. It's <i>very</i> hard to tell whether or not she's serious when she talks about a subject that doesn't affect her <i>directly</i>. She's <i>unflinchingly</i> straightforward and <i>uncompromising</i>, yes--but I'm <i>still</i> trying to <i>understand</i> her. Now, I have seen her get <i>angry</i> at Quinn over some things, but for the <i>most</i> part, I really can't tell--save for her <i>writing</i>.</p>

<P>MILLIE: Oh yes--you said that she was a <I>writer</I>, but you didn't really get into the <I>way</I> she wrote the last time we talked.</P>

<P>DARREN: Well, if you read what she writes <I>yourself</I>, it would probably <I>terrify</I> you to your <I>bones</I>. She's quite <I>dark</I> in her visualization of society as a <I>whole</I> in her writings--but <I>real</I> to the core. I'm going to take some copies of her writing <I>back</I> with me when I leave, so that the dean of the Journalism Department at Eastward College can read it--if you'll remember that the last time we talked, I told you that Daria's <I>top</I> choice college-wise, was <I>Eastward</I>, and I'd like to see her there <I>with</I> me. <I>(Grins:)</I> Speaking of which, do you think we can make some <I>room</I> for her to stay at the mansion <I>with</I> us if she does go to Eastward, Auntie?</P>

<P>MILLIE: <I>(Laughs:)</I> I don't see why not, Darren--I suppose we can <I>"squeeze"</I> her in somehow.</P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Smirks:)</I> Good. <I>(Pauses:)</I> If you think that her <I>writing's</I> something, you should see her <I>room</I>. A <I>schizophrenic</I> used to live in there, before the Morgendorffers moved in, and the walls are <I>still</I> padded, and she has <I>sawed-off</I> bars on her windows.</P>

<P>MILLIE: <I>(Gasps:)</I> You told me a little about <I>Quinn's</I> room, but you didn't tell me about <I>Daria's</I> room when you called me the night you got there. <I>(Pauses:)</I> Forgive me for saying this, Darren, don't take this the wrong way, but you're not--<I>afraid</I> of her, at least a <I>little</I>?</P>


     <P>Darren grinned and laughed out loud at <I>that</I> thought for a second.</P>


<P>DARREN: Aunt Millie, <I>believe</I> me when I tell you I feel <I>comfortable</I> around Daria, although I'll admit at first I didn't know how to <i>approach</i> her. I think under her <i>veneer</i> of cynicism and sarcasm, lies a really <i>loyal, caring</i>, and <i>good</i> person--and like I told you when I last talked to you over the phone--she is a very <i>funny</i> person to me when she uses her sarcasm, in and of itself quite <i>ironic</i>, because it's usually a <i>depressing</i> type of sarcasm that's suppose to put people <i>down</i>, yet it <i>cheers</i> me up. Others may see her as <i>"smart-alecky"</i>, but in reality, she <i>calls</i> them as she <i>sees</i> them. I can <i>respect</i> a person like that. <i>(Thought v.o.: I just hope she can respect <b>me</b> when she finds out the truth about me.)</i></p>

<p>MILLIE: Well, if that's how you feel about her, Darren--then I can't wait to meet her or the rest of the Morgendorffers. <i>(Lightens her tone:)</i> So--have you--met any--<i>girls</i> since you've been there? <i>(Sounding reserved:)</i> I can--<i>understand</i> if you haven't--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles, gently cuts her off:)</i> --Actually, Aunt Millie, I <i>have</i> met someone--she's the best friend of Daria, <i>Jane Lane</i>.</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Sounding delighted:)</i> Oh, Darren, that's <i>wonderful</i>! <i>(Pauses:)</i> And you say she's <i>Daria's</i> best friend? What's she like?</p>

<p>DARREN: She's <i>sort</i> of like Daria, but a little more <i>open</i> in her demeanor when it comes to people. She has a <i>wicked</i> sense of humor, and is a little <i>mischievous</i> as well, humor-wise. Jane's <i>down-to-earth</i>, and I feel really--<i>good</i> around her. She's an artist, and most of her paintings are in the <i>abstract-expressionist</i> style, sort of similiar to <i>Picassco</i> and <i>Goya</i>, with a little of <i>Pollack</i>, and <i>De Kooning</i> thrown in as well. Wait until you see her work--it's <i>terrific</i>, similar to Daria's writing, except that it's <i>art</i>. In fact, when I get back to the mansion, I'm going to talk to some of the <i>art critics</i> uncle Will knows and let them know about Jane. She wants to go to the prestigious <i>New York City Art School. (Pauses, gets an idea:)</i> Say--maybe <i>Jane</i> can stay at the mansion with me and Daria as well while she goes there? It's not <i>that</i> far from Eastward College.</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Ponders:)</i> Hmmm--if Jane <i>wants</i> to, I certainly won't object, Darren. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Well, I can certainly see that you're <i>quite</i> fond of her. I'm so <i>happy</i> for you! <i>(Becomes quiet:)</i> I don't mean to throw <i>cold water</i> on your knowing her, but what about when you <i>tell</i> the Morgendorffers your <i>real</i> last name? How will <i>Jane</i> react?</p>


     <p>Darren looked down, thinking for a moment about all that he knew concerning his parent's murder, and <i>why</i> he couldn't say anything for the time being, <i>even and especially</i> to his aunt, then he spoke.</p>


<p>DARREN: I--<i>hope</i> that Jane'll understand <i>why</i> I did <i>what</i> I did, Aunt Millie. I really <i>do</i> want her and my birth family to know who I am, and I <i>do</i> plan to tell them and her before I go back to the mansion--I <i>promise. (Thought v.o.: No matter <b>what</b> happens with Sanchez.)</i></p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Sighs:)</i> All right, Darren--I'll leave you to your--<i>"devices"</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: Thanks, Aunt Millie--now what about <i>you</i>? <i>(Grins:)</i> Have you found anyone <i>"special"</i> while on vacation, yet?</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Laughs, sounding coy:)</i> Ummm--weeell, I've met a <i>British gentleman--</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Ah-hah! <i>(In a "British" accent:)</i> And who is this, I might ask, dear madam?</p>

<p>MILLIE: His name's <i>Edward White</i>, he's tall and handsome, and he's a <i>stockbroker</i> in the European Common Market. As a matter of fact, I'm scheduled to meet him for tea in an hour.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Good for you, Auntie! I'd like to meet him when he comes to the States. <i>(Looks at watch, sees he has little less than an hour before the news conference:)</i> Er, Aunt Millie, I don't want to keep you from your meeting with Edward, and I'm planning to take Daria and Jane out on a "date" after I talk to you, so if there's nothing <i>else</i>--?</p>

<p>MILLIE: Well, yes--actually, there <i>is</i>, Darren.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Eyebrows raised:)</i> Oh? What?</p>

<p>MILLIE: I've been watching the news on my hotel room TV, and I saw on <i>World Cable Network</i> that the NTSB will report their findings on the--<i>(hesitates:)</i> crash that killed your parents.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Grows quiet:)</i> I--know, Aunt Millie--I plan on watching some of it before I leave with Daria and Jane this morning. <i>(Adds as an afterthought:)</i> I'm sure even <i>uncle Will</i> will probably be watching the news conference as well. I'll probably call him later in the week to gauge his <i>reaction</i> to the findings--I saw on the <i>Business Today Show</i> here that he's going to be pretty busy going over some <i>critical</i> business dealings with a group of Middle-Eastern businessmen over the next few days--since he's going to be pretty much immersed in that, I'll just hold off, because asking him on what he thinks about the crash could kind of <i>distract</i> him, and I wouldn't want to do that.</p>

<p>MILLIE: A good idea, Darren--and I'm <i>sure</i> he'll be watching. <i>(Sighs:)</i> Darren, please don't think me <i>callous</i> when I say this, but I probably <i>won't</i> be watching the news conference. I--don't think I can go <i>through</i> hearing what happened anymore. <i>(Pauses, sounding bitter:)</i> Do you know I've been <i>harassed</i> while I've been on vacation by some of those <i>damn</i> European reporters? Thank God for the security I've <i>hired</i>. At times, it seems like I've felt like the late <i>Princess Diana</i>.</p> 

<p>DARREN: That's all right, Aunt Millie--I can understand why'd you do that. <i>(Frowns:)</i> Curtis said that he and Lena went through the <i>same</i> thing while he was in Florida. This is becoming a <i>nightmare. (Pauses:)</i> I hope the Morgendorffers and Jane can <i>handle</i> the attention from the media when they find out who I am.</p>

<p>MILLIE: I'm sure that everything will work out in the end, Darren. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Well, I'm going to get ready for Edward. I'll talk to you later--I love you, dear nephew, and good luck.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gives a lopsided smile:)</i> I love you too, Auntie--and say hello to your <i>"friend"</i> Edward for me. Talk to you later too, goodbye. <i>(Hangs up, gathers his clothes he's going to wear for his "date" with Daria and Jane, and goes to the bathroom to shower and change)</i></p>


     <p>Downstairs, the doorbell rang, and Daria went to answer it. She opened the door to find a courier from the same delivery service that gave Trent the <i>"Mysterious Benefactor's"</i> financial contribution, and the raw results of Darren's DNA test. (But it was <i>not</i> the same courier.) He was a small, black-bearded man, and he was holding the <i>same</i> sort of gray envelope that held the raw DNA results--this was probably the <i>overall</i> DNA data, Daria assumed.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(In her deadpan tone:)</i> Yes?</p>

<p>COURIER: <i>(In a business-like tone:)</i> Are <i>you</i> Helen Morgendorffer?</p>

<p>DARIA: Afraid not. <i>(Smirks:)</i> Does that <i>disqualify</i> me?</p>

<p>COURIER: <i>(Frowns slightly, thought v.o.: The "smart-ass" girl <b>Luthor</b> told me about. Well, I'm going to get a tip--she won't blow <b>me</b> off.)</i> No, miss--just sign here, please. <i>(Gives Daria his pad and pen, which she takes and signs, and then he gives her the gray envelope:) Ahem. (Holds out his hand, and slightly steps <b>inside</b> the doorway so Daria can't shut it in his face)</i></p>


     <p>Daria cut her eyes slightly at the courier, and looked down at the man's outstretched hand, as well as his relative <i>position</i> in her doorway, and smirked.</p> 


<p>DARIA: Hang on--I'll <i>get</i> you your tip.</p> 

<p>COURIER: <i>(Looks hopeful:) Really</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: Yes, but I'm gonna have to get it out of my <i>boot</i>. I carry some money in there--<i>(pauses as the man looks at her, confused:)</i> you know, I don't want you to <i>look</i> at my <i>leg</i> when I do--?</p>

<p>COURIER: <i>(Makes a disgusted face--he doesn't want to look at Daria doing such a thing anyway:)</i> Oh, yeah, sure--lemme <i>step back and turn around. (He does so:)</i> Okay, you can <i>get</i> it.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Now smirks even <b>more</b>, this time wickedly, deadpan:)</i> Thank you, kind sir--I <i>will</i> "get" it. <i>(Promptly and calmly <b>shuts</b> the door, walks back to the living room holding the envelope with her Mona Lisa smile:)</i> The <i>door</i>, that is.</p>


     <p>When the man heard the door shut, he knew <i>immediately</i> that he had been <i>tricked</i>. He sighed, did not <i>bother</i> to turn around, (there was <i>no</i> way he was going to give that girl the <i>satisfaction</i> of seeing him look like an <i>idiot</i>) walked with a <i>foolishly dignified-looking</i> strut, got into his truck, and drove off calmly. About a block down the street, the man pulled over and <i>cried</i> his head off into the steering wheel--not only did he not get a tip, but he would also have to pay the <i>bet</i> he had made with his <i>fellow co-worker</i> over getting one from <i>this</i> family.</p>

     <p>In the meantime, Daria looked at the envelope and was about to toss it on the coffee table when <i>Quinn</i> came downstairs, stretching and yawning, having just changed into her regular clothing. She saw Daria holding the envelope.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(Points at what Daria's holding, walks up to her:)</i> Daria, what's <i>that</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> Good morning, sis, and it's an <i>envelope</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> I can <i>see</i> that. What <i>kind</i> of envelope is it?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks at the envelope and turns it over and over, smirks:)</i> Well, I believe it's a <i>large, gray, thin</i> envelope--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Frowns, becomes annoyed, cuts her off:)</i> --I <i>know</i> how the envelope <i>looks</i>, Daria. What's <i>in</i> it?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(With her expressionless look:)</i> Do I look like I have <i>x-ray vision</i>, Quinn? I just got it from the courier service, and I don't know what's in the envelope, but I'm assuming it's the <i>overall</i> DNA results on our bro, since it looks like the first one that came with the <i>raw</i> results. I'm <i>not</i> opening it, because it's addressed to <i>mom</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Smacks her mouth in disgust:) Daaaaria</i>! <i>(Suddenly <b>snatches</b> the envelope from Daria:)</i> Mom won't <i>mind</i> if we <i>open</i> it! We <i>know</i> Darren's our bro, right? This just <i>confirms</i> it!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow in surprise:)</i> You <i>remembered</i> what Dr. Mull said? Hey, I gotta admit, that's <i>damned</i> impressive for someone who usually reserves what <i>little</i> memory she has for some fashion trends and what guys she chooses to go out with based on who has the best <i>cars, houses,</i> or <i>yachts.</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Glares at Daria:) Funny</i>, Daria--and for your information, I promised our brother last night that I would only go out with <i>three guys per week</i> from now on because of me takin' my studying for the Fashion Institute <i>seriously</i>!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Gives a <b>fake</b> look of stunned disbelief, puts the palms of her hands on both sides of her face:) No</i>! <i>Only</i> three guys a week? This <i>is</i> earth-shattering!</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Daria's sarcasm going over her head yet again:)</i> It <i>should</i> be, Daria, now why don't you leave me <i>alone</i>! <i>(Begins to open the envelope:)</i> Now, let's see if Darren's <i>completely</i> our bro--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> --You mean, he's only been <i>partly</i> our bro after all this time?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Fumes:)</i> You <i>know</i> what I'm sayin', Daria! <i>(Fumbles with the envelope, pulls out the results, suddenly <b>screams</b> with her eyes wide open:) AAAAAAH! NOOOO!</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(With a stunned look on her face, takes the results from Quinn and looks at them:)</i> Quinn, don't tell me that Darren's <i>not</i>--</p>


     <p>Darren, having just taken a quick shower and stepping out of the stall, heard Quinn's scream. Alarmed and still wet, he snatched his white towel-robe that was hanging on the doorknob, putting it on and wrapping the belt around himself, and <i>tore</i> out of the guest bathroom in the hallway. Were the people who hired <i>Sanchez</i> trying to come <i>after</i> his birth family? He prepared himself, remembering <i>instantly</i> the martial arts skills he knew. Darren ran down the stairs, his heart beating fast. He came to the foot of the stairs, and saw Daria and Quinn standing in the middle of the living room, looking at each other, then noticing Darren. He looked around quickly, seeing nothing, and came over to his sisters.</p> 


<p>DARREN: <i>(Looking concerned:)</i> What's going on? Why'd you scream, Quinn?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Speaks before Quinn can for a change, smirks:)</i> Oh, our sis just got a <i>paper cut</i> on her finger while opening the envelope that contained the overall DNA results about you. <i>(Quinn puts her index finger in her mouth while Daria, who has taken the envelope back from Quinn and is looking down at the paper with the results:)</i> By the way, the overall results <i>confirm</i> that your our bro, lock, stock, and barrel.</p>

<p><i>(Note to reader: Had you <b>going</b> there, did I not?)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sighs in relief:)</i> That's good--if there <i>were</i> any mistakes, Dr. Mull would've <i>called</i> us and said something. <i>(Cocks an eyebrow at Quinn, slightly annoyed:)</i> Quinn, you scared me half to death shouting like that--I thought something was <i>wrong</i>!</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Takes her finger out of her mouth, looks and shows it to Darren:)</i> Something <i>is</i> wrong, Darren! This is <i>serious</i>! I can't wear a dress or shoes with an <i>unfashionable bandage</i> around my finger! <i>(Darren looks at Quinn, amazed)</i> I mean, it just wouldn't <i>look</i> right! What color <i>nail polish</i> would go <i>with</i> it? I'm gonna soak my finger in some water to keep it from bleeding--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Now gets into her <b>"Playing-with-my-sister's-feeble-little-mind"</b> mode:)</i> --But wouldn't that <i>wrinkle</i> your finger? You wouldn't want <i>that</i>, would you?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Realizes:) Ohmygosh</i>--ohmygosh, you're <i>RIGHT</i>, Daria! I <i>can't</i> do that! <i>(Daria smirks, while Darren chuckles to himself, shakes his head slowly)</i> I'm gonna go upstairs and wrap my finger up in a towel until it stops bleeding! I'm expectin' the Fashion Club over while you guys are gone, and I can't have them seein' me like <i>this</i>! <i>(Rushes upstairs)</i></p>


     <p>Darren and Daria watched Quinn go upstairs, and looked at each other for a moment, then Darren spoke.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Sighs, smiles sheepishly:)</i> So, I'm your's and Quinn's "Big Bro" <i>"officially"</i> official, now, huh?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Gives a small smile:)</i> Yep--and mom and dad's son <i>"officially"</i> official, too--<i>poor</i> fella. <i>(Darren laughs, not just at Daria's remark, but at the <b>irony</b> of her words)</i> It also means you're subject to <i>endless</i> teasing and sarcastic remarks from me, bro--next to <i>Quinn</i>, of course.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smirks, in a mocking tone:)</i> You mean, <i>our</i> little sister will be getting your "famed" barbs first? I feel <i>so</i> offended.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Now smirks herself:)</i> Oh, don't worry about <i>that</i>, Darren--you'll get your <i>fair</i> share of my "barbs"--after all, I have almost <i>twenty years</i> worth to make up to you.</p>


     <p>The smile Darren had slowly faded. Daria then came to realize the <i>true</i> meaning of her words. Both stared at each other for a moment more, then Darren spoke in a quiet tone.</p>


<p>DARREN: Almost <i>twenty</i> years, Daria--<i>(pauses:)</i> I hope--<i>(hesitates:)</i> I hope you, me, Quinn, and my birth parents can get--well--<i>closer</i> to each other.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> You're <i>sure</i> you <i>want</i> to be close to mom and dad? I mean, that <i>"Morgendorffer Mystique"</i> must be rubbing off <i>onto</i> you--I'll prepare the <i>straightjacket. (Darren smiles, while Daria becomes serious and quiet, searches for words, looks around so as not to be embarassed:)</i> I thought--I thought we <i>were</i> becoming closer to each other, Darren. <i>(Thought v.o.: There's goes my <b>mind</b>--the softness has <b>completely</b> taken over--<b>damn</b>!)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks a bit pained, smiles weakly:)</i> I suppose we're <i>getting</i> there, sis--I just hope that we'll get <i>so</i> close that we can <i>(searches for words:)--"overlook"</i> some of the--<i>"faults"</i> that we might find out about each other, you know, if we might <i>discover</i> some things that could be--taken the <i>wrong</i> way?</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Narrows her eyes:) "Overlook"? "Faults"? "Taken the wrong way?" (Pauses:)</i> Darren, I don't understand--what <i>are</i> you talking about?</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Grimaces, bites his lip, gives an unsure shrug:)</i> It's, well--</p>


     <p>The cell phone on the living room table rang at that moment, and Darren used it to his <i>advantage</i>.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Goes up the stairs before Daria can say something else:)</i> --that's probably Jane, wanting to know when we'll be ready to go. I'm going upstairs to change, okay? <i>(Leaves out of sight)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Watches him go:)</i> Um--sure, bro. <i>(Picks up the cell phone on the third ring, and clicks it on:)</i> Hello?</p>

<p>VOICE: Yo!</p>

<p>DARIA: Hey, Jane--I'm assuming you're calling to know when we're all going out this morning?</p>

<p>JANE: Yeah--uh--when are you and Darren gonna be ready to go to the <i>arcade</i>?</p> 

<p>DARIA: Well, we're--<i>(pauses, cocks an eyebrow:)</i> how'd you <i>know</i> that we'd be going to the arcade?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Sounding in her motherly mocking-admonishing tone:)</i> Now, <i>deeear</i>--you know you can't hide <i>anything</i> from <i>me--</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> --Maybe I can find the perfect place to hide your <i>body</i> from the authorities when I <i>kill</i> you, if they ask me where you are, provided they <i>suspect</i> me. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Since you figured out <i>where</i> we're going, I'm going to let you figure out <i>when</i> we're going.</p>

<p>JANE: Hmmm--given your habit of <i>limiting</i> human contact to as <i>little</i> as you can get on any given day, you'd want us to get there as <i>early</i> as possible, when there would be relatively <i>few</i> people, so I'd say <i>10:00 a.m.</i>--how's that?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Narrows her eyes:)</i> You're <i>good--damn</i> good. However, we might want to wait a few extra minutes to leave--my bro wants to look at a news conference from the NTSB about that private jet plane crash that killed those <i>"Appleton"</i> people almost a month ago. It's supposed to start about 9:30 a.m. this morning, and apparently, the NTSB has the <i>answers</i> as to what happened.</p>

<p>JANE: The crash that killed that <i>mysterious</i> "Arthur Jr." guy's parents? <i>(After a moment:)</i> Yeah, I heard about that just <i>before</i> we flew out for our vacation--<i>(snorts:) what</i> a way to go off--hearing about the <i>crash</i> of a plane and then going on <i>one</i> the <i>very</i> next day. I remember about being a little <i>worried</i> when I sat beside my mom for a short time on our plane, then putting it in the back of my mind. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Say, <i>why</i> would Darren want to look at <i>that</i>? You think he <i>knew</i> that guy, or something?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Ponders:)</i> Hmmm--I hadn't thought about it like <i>that</i>, but watching this news conference seemed <i>really</i> important to him. I decided to go along with his request, if nothing else, to see his <i>reaction</i> to what the NTSB said. I'm <i>half-wondering</i> if the <i>same</i> sort of a thing happened to his adopted parents. I'm sure it was an <i>accident</i>, but I'm guessing he's not telling us because it's too <i>traumatic</i> for him to remember what happened. He hasn't said anything at <i>all</i> about how they died. I thought about <i>asking</i> him--but, well--you know--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(In a quiet tone:)</i> --You didn't wanna <i>pressure</i> him. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Girl, he's <i>gotten</i> to you, hasn't he? <i>(Daria rolls her eyes, but says nothing)</i> To be honest with you, I've had the <i>same</i> feeling something was up with him while we were jogging this morning, because he seemed kind of--<i>zoned out</i> at times, but I didn't say anything--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:) --Are</i> you gonna say anything to him?</p>

<p>JANE: I've--<i>thought</i> about it, but I figure he'll say something when's he's <i>good and ready</i>--?</p>


     <p>To Daria, the tone of Jane's voice was one of a <i>question</i>, unsure, as if Jane wanted to see what <i>Daria</i> would do first. Daria pondered for a moment, then spoke.</p>


<p>DARIA: Maybe we can <i>both</i> wait until Darren's ready. I mean, with the <i>hell</i> he's gone through, he at least <i>deserves</i> our patience. I'm sure he'll say something before he has to go back to Eastward, at least--still, in <i>private</i>, it wouldn't hurt us to <i>speculate</i> on any sort of connection between Darren and these <i>"Appleton"</i> people.</p>

<p>JANE: Yeah--I guess we could do that. <i>(Lightens tone:)</i> So, do you want me to come there, or will you guys come here in Darren's car?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> Oh, I'm in a <i>"What-the-hell"</i> mood today--what do <i>you</i> want to do?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Snickering sound:)</i> You're <i>always</i> in a <i>"What-the-hell"</i> mood. <i>(Daria smirks) (Jane says nothing for a moment, then:)</i> Ah, I can wait for you guys here. Blow the horn, and I'll be out there in a <i>New York minute.</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Okay, be out there, or we'll behave like <i>impatient</i> New Yorkers and leave you hanging.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Snorts playfully:)</i> Lat--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Cuts her off:)</i> --Hold it, <i>"Calamity Jane"</i>. I almost forgot to say something <i>else</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Sounding surprised:)</i> Oh? What?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sighs:)</i> Don't <i>ever</i> think that you feel like you're in the <i>way</i> of Darren and me getting to know one another as <i>brother and sister</i>--this isn't like what happened with <i>Tom</i>, you're <i>not</i> like me when I acted like a <i>jerk</i> when you two were--<i>(pauses:)</i> going together, and I'm <i>passed</i> all that crap now. Darren's my bro, and as of right now, your <i>boyfriend</i>, but that shouldn't stop you from wanting to be with <i>us</i>. So, from this time forth, I <i>adjure</i> you to put such thoughts out of your <i>reprobate</i> mind, deal?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Sounding relieved:) Deal</i>, pard.</p>

<p>DARIA: Okay, then--we'll see you later. <i>(Clicks off phone)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to Gerald Woo's apartment, Los Angeles, about 15 minutes later)</i></p>


     <p>Gerald Woo had been awakened by David's phone call about 10 minutes ago, having heard from him about the NTSB's surprising announcement concerning the private jet plane crash that killed the Appletons. After guzzling down his quickly-made cup of coffee to help himself wake up, Woo, still in his pajamas, turned on his TV, and sat down on the couch in his living room. The news conference had just started. There was a National Transportation Safety Board spokesman, heavy-set, balding, and dressed in a blue business suit, standing behind a podium that was loaded with microphones. Behind and standing on both sides of the spokesman were several people, various officials from national and local law enforcement agencies. In the foreground were media from all over the country. The NTSB spokesman was already speaking.</p>


<p>NTSB SPOKESMAN: --Now the jet with Arthur and Lucille Appleton and the crew went off the radar screen at about <i>11:25 p.m.</i> E.D.T., 9:25 p.m. M.D.T., and the wreckage was not located until around <i>12:00 a.m.</i> E.D.T., 10:00 p.m. M.D.T., then around 12:15 a.m. E.D.T., 10:15 p.m. M.D.T., the first reports came in that the plane had crashed, based on search and rescue aircraft that had been dispatched to where the jet's position had last been reported and seen on the radar. <i>(Pauses:)</i> The NTSB, after locating and listening to the jet's Black Box, has determined that the cause of the crash was a <i>busted fuel line</i>. The valve that channeled the fuel into the plane's engine simply gave out and failed. The cause, we've concluded, was <i>obvious</i>. I'll take your questions now. <i>(Hands raised in the foreground, the spokesman points to one:)</i> Yes, you?</p>


<p><i>(Note to reader: E.D.T. is Eastern Daylight Time, and M.D.T. is Mountain Daylight Time)</i></p>


<p>REPORTER: It's a well-known <i>fact</i> that the Appletons were quite <i>insistent</i> their private jet fleet have <i>very</i> thorough flight checks. <i>How</i> could such a thing like a fuel line valve be <i>overlooked</i>? Could someone from the jet's maintenance crew at <i>LaGuardia International</i> been at <i>fault</i>?</p>


     <p>In the Morgendorffer's living room, Daria and Darren, who was now dressed in some regular clothing, were sitting on the middle couch watching the TV. Darren <i>quietly</i> nodded his head in agreement to the reporter's question, looking at the screen intently. Daria cut her eyes at her brother, looking for any show of <i>emotion</i>, and privately wondering what was going on with him. Quinn walked by the two, glanced at what was on the TV, shrugged, and went up to her room. Meanwhile, the spokesman responded to the reporter's question.</p>


<p>NTSB SPOKESMAN: No, we <i>throughly</i> checked the crew at LaGuardia International, and they were <i>cleared</i> of any wrongdoing. We were aware of the Appleton's rather <i>agressive</i> flight checks concerning their aircraft, but based on what we heard on the tape, and the wreckage we recovered from the crash site, it was indeed an unfortunate <i>accident</i>. It's a known <i>fact</i> that even in some of the most <i>thoroughly</i> maintained aircraft, something could <i>inexplicably</i> go wrong, resulting in a <i>catastrophic</i> accident. No, we're <i>sure</i> it was an accident.</p>


     <p>Darren frowned slightly to himself--the NTSB spokesman seemed so <i>confident</i>. Could Woo have been <i>mistaken</i>? He immediately put <i>that</i> thought from his mind--he had <i>faith</i> in Woo, seeing firsthand what the brilliant detective could do, having located Darren's birth family faster than Darren could have possibly hoped for. His <i>uncle Will</i> thought highly enough of Woo to recommend him to Darren just for that, so there was no way Darren was going to question Woo now, other than to later call Woo and ask how the search was going for Sanchez.</p>  

     <p>In his office, William Appleton sat at his desk and impassively watched the large projection TV that had been hidden behind a marble wall on the side, and now, thanks to a remote control located on his desk, had been exposed. Benny Lodell sat on the left couch, watched intently, then smirked <i>wickedly</i> when the NTSB spokesman said it was an accident, just as his source said. Benny looked over at William, who gave a quick glance at Benny, and said nothing. Benny's smirk slowly vanished, and he looked back at the TV screen <i>sullenly.</i></p>

     <p>Woo sat back on his couch and narrowed his eyes. <i>Those arrogant governmental idiots.</i> He then turned his thoughts to Sanchez. How in the <i>hell</i> did he pull it off? Well, <i>when</i> Woo and his agency located Sanchez, he'd find out. Woo got up and went into his kitchen to fix himself some breakfast after the news conference went back to a World Cable Network anchorwoman, who was talking to an aviation expert about the crash.</p>

     <p>In the room of a seedy apartment somewhere, a short, black-haired Hispanic man with a thin mustache dressed in a tanktop and wearing pajama pants laid on his bed propped up on his pillow and <i>grinned</i> at the broken-down but still-viewable small color TV set. <i>Those <b>saps</b>. You did such a <b>damn</b> good job with that fuel valve--just <b>loosened</b> it enough to let it <b>look</b> like it was tightened, and it busted on the way to Denver--they <b>never</b> suspected the deed was done at Los Angeles International. Soon, Lodell will be called, and the second part of the payment will be gotten--hell, maybe you should even get a little <b>more</b> money--you <b>deserve</b> that, right? You can get some <b>more</b> booze, and women--shouldn't have wasted almost all of the first payment of <b>$10,000</b>--ah, well, hell--the second payment will get you on <b>"Easy Street"</b>, then--</i></p>

     <p>There was a loud banging on the door, startling the man from his thoughts. He glared at the door with a deep frown.</p>


<p>VOICE: <i>(From outside the door:)</i> HEY, <i>GONZALEZ</i>--WHERE'S MY DAMN RENT?!</p>

<p>GONZALEZ: IT'LL BE HERE SOON, JERK! GET THE HELL OFF OF MY BACK--IT'S TOO FREAKIN' EARLY FOR YOU TO COME TO MY ROOM! <i>(Shouts and curses are heard from the other rooms from people who have been disturbed by the loud, hostile verbal exchange)</i></p>

<p>VOICE: I'LL COME ANY <i>DAMN</i> TIME I PLEASE! AS FOR THAT RENT, IT HAD <i>BETTER</i> BE HERE SOON--OR YOUR ASS'LL BE OUT ON THE STREET, YOU GOT THAT?! <i>(Steps fade away from the door for a bit, then the voice shouts at the curses:)</i> SHUT THE HELL UP, ALL OF YOU! DAMN, LOUSY, FREELOADERS! <i>(Steps fade off down the hallway)</i></p>

<p>GONZALEZ: <i>(Still glares at the door, thought v.o.: Go to hell--and the name is <b>Julio Sanchez</b>, you fat, sweaty, bald-headed <b>bastard</b>. I'll be out of this <b>hellhole</b> soon enough. I'll just rest, and then take my <b>time</b> and make that call to Lodell--or maybe <b>"The Big Apple-man"</b> himself.) (Lays back on his pillow with a smug grin on his face, and closes his eyes)</i></p>


<p><i>(Scene changes back to the Morgendorffer's, 15 minutes later)</i></p>


     <p>The news conference had just ended, with the TV scene going back to the two morning hosts in the studio. After this, Darren rose off the couch with Daria, clicking off the TV with the remote.</p> 


<p>DARREN: Well, that was an--<i>interesting</i> news conference. It seemed like the crash investigation the NTSB conducted--<i>quick</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: I'll say--I'm surprised they just didn't send a <i>fax</i> to all of the news organizations and leave it at that. <i>(Darren gives a quiet chuckle)</i> Are you ready to go, bro?</p>

<p>DARREN: Just let me go upstairs and retrieve something, and I'll be ready. <i>(Tosses keys to her:)</i> If you want, you can wait in the car for me.</p>

<p>DARIA: Okay--thanks, bro. <i>(Opens door, goes outside, sees the Fashion Club coming down the street, turns to Darren, who's about to go upstairs:)</i> Better <i>hurry</i>, Darren--<i>"fashion fiends"</i> at 3:00. <i>(Goes outside)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Thanks, sis. <i>(Comes into the hallway from the stairs as Quinn, who's carrying the gold dress Darren bought her last night, comes out of her room:)</i> Your Fashion Club friends are coming up, sis. <i>(Eyes dress:)</i> I see you're going to show off your Circa "Original" to them, eh?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Giggles:)</i> Yeah, and thanks again, bro--for the dress an' tellin' me about the Fashion Club coming up. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I hope you have a good time--even if it's <i>with</i> Daria.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> And what's <i>that</i> supposed to mean?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Smirks:)</i> You know, our sis can be so <i>boring</i> to be around sometimes, not that I'm <i>criticizin'</i> her or somethin'--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Rolls his eyes, sounding slightly sarcastic:)</i> --No, <i>of course</i> not--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> --Oh, don't get me <i>wrong</i>, bro--I'm sure that being out with Daria has it's advantages, like what <i>"brainy"</i> books to read, or studying some <i>history</i> or something, but I think after you've gone out with her, as compared to <i>me</i>, you'll see that you had a <i>better</i> time with me last night.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sighs:)</i> Quinn, I'm trying to not <i>distinguish</i> the differences between "hanging out" with you or Daria. Both of you have your own <i>ways</i>--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Frowns slightly:)</i> --You've got <i>that</i> right--</p>

<p>DARREN: --I'm just trying to <i>accept</i> the way both of you are. In my eyes, neither one of you is <i>better</i> than the other. <i>(Thought v.o.: Although it seems like you're trying to make me choose <b>Daria</b> at times, sis.)</i> And it isn't just Daria I'm going out with today--<i>Jane's</i> coming with us as well. <i>(Quinn crosses her arms, folds the dress around them, pouts, something that Darren notices:)</i> What? <i>(Pauses, frowns slightly:)</i> You're not going to <i>start</i> about Jane, are you?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Keeps the dress in her left arm, holds up one hand with her free right hand, speaks in a placating tone:) N-no</i>, bro, of course not! If you wanna take Jane with you an' Daria, then that's <i>your</i> business! <i>(Then adds as an afterthought, trails off:)</i> Of course, <i>we</i> didn't have anybody with <i>us</i> last night--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Snorts:)</i> --No, just <i>half</i> of the boys in Lawndale <i>around</i> us <i>fawning</i> all over you, and their <i>dates</i> on <i>me. (Pauses:)</i> Speaking of which, don't you think maybe you should cut back even <i>more</i> on going out with the <i>number</i> of boys per week, sis? I know you said <i>three</i>, but I've been thinking--<i>(hesitates:)</i> maybe you should consider just <i>one</i> guy per--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Now alarmed, cuts him off:) --Daaaaren</i>! I <i>need</i> to be <i>popular</i> an' in <i>demand</i> by the guys! I <i>said</i> I'd be <i>serious</i> when it came to my studies, an' I <i>meant</i> it! Why are you tryin' to--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gently cuts her off:)</i> --Fine, sis, that's <i>okay</i>. I'm sorry for bringing it up. <i>(Sighs:)</i> As long as you promised to be more serious with your studies, I guess that's <i>all</i> I can expect for now--excuse me. <i>(Goes into his room, shuts the door)</i></p>


     <p>Quinn went to the top of the stairs, about to go down to the living room, then stopped and looked back at Darren's door. She frowned to herself, frustrated, hearing the <i>annoyed</i> tone in Darren's words.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(Thought v.o.: Geez, bro, why do you <b>have</b> to be so <b>strict</b> n' stuff? You're soundin' like mom and dad! I mean, it's bad enough that I gotta <b>accept</b> you an' Jane, and gettin' <b>serious</b> about my studies--now you want me to be cuttin' <b>back</b> on my dates, too? Give me a break, okay?) (Goes down the stairs, then stops halfway, sighs to herself, thought v.o.: I know he <b>does</b> care about me, though, so I shouldn't complain all <b>that</b> much--[pauses:] great, now I'm gettin' <b>soft</b>.) (Continues down the rest of the stairs to wait for the Fashion Club)</i></p>


     <p>Darren, after getting his now fully-charged cell phone, then folding it up and putting it in his pants pocket, was about to leave his room when he saw <i>$100</i> on his dresser. Jake had given it to him last night to help out on his "date" with Quinn. Of course, he did not <i>need</i> to spend it, and secretly put it aside during the "date". He picked up the money and went out into the hallway, going to Jake and Helen's bedroom. He quickly slipped inside, and put the cash on their dresser under Jake's belongings, then slipped back out and went downstairs. Darren hoped that Jake would think that he forgot to take his money with him when he went to work, and would pocket it back, thinking nothing of it.</p> 

     <p>Outside, Daria was waiting in the passenger seat of Darren's car reading Paul Gallico's <i>Love, Let Me Not Hunger</i>. Sandi, Tiffany, and Stacy saw her and came up.</p> 


<p>SANDI: <i>(Hesitant, faux smile:)</i> Um--like, <i>hi</i>, Quinn's cou--uh, <i>Darla</i>.</p>

<p>TIFFANY: <i>(Ditto:)</i> Yeah...hi...<i>Darla</i>.</p>

<p>STACY: <i>(Begins to speak, then looks at both of her "friends", confused:)</i> Er--Sandi, Tiffany, I think her name's <i>Daria. (Sandi and Tiffany frown at Stacy, who cringes:) Eep</i>!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks up at Stacy, cocks an eyebrow, deadpan:)</i> Oh, <i>you</i> got my name <i>right</i>, Stacy--will wonders never <i>cease</i>? <i>(Pauses, does a Daria-style double-take:)</i> Um--did you all just say "Hi, Darl"--I mean, <i>"Daria"</i>?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Now forces a faux happy mood:)</i> Like, <i>of course</i>, Darl--<i>Daria</i>. We just stopped by here to say <i>hello</i> to you before we go and see Quinn.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Thought v.o., smirks: Trying to make <b>"nice"</b> with me to get on my <b>"good"</b> side so you can get in good with <b>Darren</b>, eh? You all ought to know via Quinn that I have <b>no</b> good side:)</i> If it's <i>Darren</i> you're all looking for, I'm afraid you're out of luck--<i>again</i>.</p> 

<p>SANDI: <i>(Arches an eyebrow:)</i> Like, what exactly do you mean, Darl--<i>Daria</i>?</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(In a deadpan mocking voice:)</i> Darren's going out with <i>me</i>, his <i>dear</i> sister, again, <i>that's</i> what I mean--after all, he and I have to <i>catch up</i> on our <i>lost</i> past, remember? However, my <i>cousin</i> Quinn's waiting for you guys inside, though--<i>(pauses:)</i> go on, don't keep her <i>waiting</i>, now. <i>(Goes back to reading her book, while Sandi turns red with anger for being dismissed so easily, and Tiffany and Stacy look at each other, heart-broken)</i></p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Frowns, now begins to get furious:)</i> Look here, you <i>brain</i>--</p>


     <p>At that moment, Darren came out the front door with Quinn. Sandi looked over at them, and suddenly became calm, covering herself, smiling. Tiffany and Stacy came over to both of them and looked up at Darren dreamily.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Moans inwardly:)</i> Oh, hello, uh--Sandi, Stacy, and er--Tiffany.</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Tries to act above it all, but failing miserably, comes over, smiles slightly:)</i> Like, um, <i>hi</i>, Darren.</p>

<p>STACY: <i>(Excited, giggles:) Hi</i>, Darren!</p>

<p>TIFFANY: <i>(As excited as you can imagine her getting:)</i> Hiiii...Darren!</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Off-handedly:)</i> Hi, guys. <i>(Notices them still looking at Darren:)</i> Um, <i>guys</i>?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Annoyed, rolls her eyes, glares at Quinn:) Quiiinn</i>! We're like, talking to your <i>cousin</i>! <i>(Daria looks up and smirks <b>wickedly</b> at Quinn, while Darren looks uncomfortably at both of his sisters:)</i> Can't you like, <i>wait</i> until we've finished speaking <i>to</i> him?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Silently sullen:) Sorry</i>, Sandi.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gently moves past the Fashion Club, goes to his car:)</i> Listen, I'd like to <i>really</i> talk to you all, but I'm going out with my sister and her friend Jane, and we're running kind of late, so maybe we'll see each other a little <i>later</i>--?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Looks surprised:)</i> That <i>"art-geek" weirdo</i> friend of Darl--Daria's? <i>That</i> Jane? <i>(Stacy and Tiffany smirk at Sandi's remark)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Stops, stares forward for a moment, frowns, then turns and looks directly down at Sandi:) Wait</i> a moment. <i>What</i> did you call my <i>girlfriend</i>? <i>(The Fashion Club, except Quinn, gasps in shock, while Daria gives a small Mona Lisa smile while looking at the scene)</i></p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Searches for words:)</i> D-did y-you just say--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Glares at Sandi:) --Yes</i>. Jane Lane is my <i>girlfriend</i>, and I don't appreciate <i>any</i> of you talking about her like that. Quinn, tell your friends if they want to be <i>my</i> friend, they'd <i>better</i> lay off of Jane, okay?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Gives a small smirk:) Sure</i>, Darren.</p> 

<p>DARREN: Good. <i>(Coldly to Sandi, Stacy, and Tiffany:) Excuse me. (Brushes past the rest of the Fashion Club, gets into his car, starts it up, and backs out into the street, then drives off)</i></p>


     <p>The Fashion Club looked at each other, stunned. Sandi <i>glared</i> down the street where Darren's car went, while a sad-looking Stacy and Tiffany glanced in the same direction, then went in with Quinn.</p>


<p>SANDI: <i>(Thought v.o.: I, like, don't know what hold that "Jane-person" has <b>over</b> you, Darren, but I'm <b>not</b> giving up <b>pursuing</b> you. What Sandi Griffin <b>wants</b>, Sandi Griffin <b>gets</b>.) (Follows the rest of the Fashion Club inside)</i></p>


     <p>In the car, Daria looked at her brother and noticed his deep frown. She could not recall at any time since he had come into their lives that he'd been so <i>angry</i>. No doubt about it now--he must have <i>really</i> liked Jane to stand up for her like that. After that <i>kiss</i> she saw between the two yesterday, Daria should not have been surprised.</p> 


<p>DARIA: <i>(Concerned:)</i> Darren--um, are you okay?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Now relaxes, sighs:)</i> I'm--fine, sis--the <i>further</i> we're from those <i>arrogant</i> girls, the better. <i>(Cuts his eyes over at Daria:)</i> The absolute <i>nerve</i> of that Sandi to speak of Jane like that makes me <i>hot</i>. What does Quinn <i>see</i> in those girls--<i>especially</i> that Sandi?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>Popularity</i>, bro--popularity. The Fashion Club is supposed to be <i>the</i> clique of Lawndale High School, at least in the eyes of most of my fellow <i>brain-dead</i> classmates. If you're not in Sandi's group, then you're looked <i>down</i> upon, fashion, and otherwise. Quinn got into the Fashion Club because Sandi offered her the vice-presidency the <i>first day</i> we came to town. Sandi and Quinn <i>pretend</i> to be friends, but they can <i>barely</i> stand one another, <i>competing</i> all of the time.</p>

<p>DARREN: Then why did Sandi <i>offer</i> Quinn the vice-presidency of the Fashion Club in the <i>first</i> place, knowing that she and Quinn would be at each other's <i>throats</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: I have a theory about that--<i>(smirks:) "Keep your friends close--</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smirks, looks sideways at Daria, nods knowingly:) --But keep your enemies even closer"</i>. Got you. I wish Quinn would just <i>dump</i> friends like that.</p>

<p>DARIA: Wishing <i>won't</i> make it happen, bro--Quinn's gotta see that for <i>herself</i>, and the day <i>that</i> happens, I'll be joining so many <i>clubs</i> at Lawndale High School, Jodie Landon will turn <i>green</i> with <i>envy. (Goes back to reading her book)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Not knowing about Jodie's club-joining "obsession" at the school, simply gives Daria a quick, strange look, then sighs:)</i> There's Jane's house.</p>


     <p>Darren's car rolled up in front of the Lane's, and Jane immediately came out of the house without Darren having to blow the horn, and getting into the back seat. Darren smiled as she got in, looking back.</p>


<p>DARREN: Hey, Jane.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Hey, Darren. <i>(Notices Daria next, smirks:)</i> Oh, <i>hey</i>, Daria.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(While still reading her book:)</i> Hey. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Don't mind me, you guys
--do the <i>deed</i>, and let's get the hell to the damn arcade and play some games.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Confused:) "Deed"</i>, sis?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:)</i> She means <i>this</i>, Darren. <i>(Reaches over the front seat and grabs Darren's head, turns it around and kisses him on the lips. Darren then slowly turns around, wide-eyed, and now light-headed)</i></p> 

<p>DARREN: Oh, <i>that</i> deed. <i>(Starts to slowly drive forward)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(While still reading, smirks:)</i> Want <i>me</i> to drive your car, Darren, or do you think you can handle it without <i>crashing</i> into a <i>telephone pole</i>? <i>(Jane sits back in the seat, arms crossed, smirks wickedly, while Darren keeps driving, red-faced, mockingly glares at Daria)</i></p>


     <p>About 10 minutes later, Darren's car pulled up to <i>Mr. Fun's Exciting World of Games</i> arcade, and the three got out. Jane sauntered up to Darren and hooked her arm up with his, smiling, as they went into the arcade, led by Daria. The arcade had only about five people in it (two were girls, who looked at Darren dreamily, but stopped looking when they saw Jane giving them the glare to end <i>all</i> glares), and the three basically had a run of most of the games. Daria went straight to the arcade version of the new <i>CyberKron II</i> game, and put in a token she had from a previous visit. Both Jane and Darren joined her there and watched.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Quietly:)</i> Thanks for standing up for me like that, Darren, but it's <i>cool</i>--I can handle fashion-obsessed <i>"shallowheads"</i> like Sandi Griffin and her little horde.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(In the same tone:)</i> I--know, it's just that I can't <i>stand</i> people that come across in that way. <i>I</i> never had a problem like that while I was in high school.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks, sarcastic:) You</i>? Never having a <i>"problem"</i> like that? Gee, I can't <i>imagine</i> why. What high school did you go to?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Privately hesitates over this, then comes clean:)</i> The <i>Orbison Academy</i>. <i>(Daria cuts her eyes at Darren, eyebrow cocked, then goes back to playing the game)</i></p>

<p>JANE: What's that, a <i>private school</i>, or something?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Hesitates:)</i> Well--yes--like Eastward College, my (adopted) parents really, uh, worked <i>hard</i> to get me in there. <i>(Laughs uneasily, adds:) "Nothing but the <b>best</b> for our son"</i>, they used to say. <i>(Changes subject:)</i> Hmph--what's the use of Daria having <i>all</i> the fun while we're standing around watching her? Isn't this an <i>arcade</i>? Let me get some tokens for us, and we'll join her, okay?</p>

<p>JANE: Sure thing, Darren. <i>(Watches him leave them to go to the token guy at the counter, turns to Daria:)</i> Hey, you've almost reached the second level?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(While going hard at it:)</i> Yep--actually, I heard that the home version is supposed to be <i>harder</i>, so I shouldn't be surprised to get there this fast. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Didn't my bro say that he went to the <i>Orbison Academy</i>?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Raises an eyebrow:)</i> Yeah--so?</p>

<p>DARIA: I've <i>heard</i> of it--it's a pretty <i>swanky</i> private high school--pretty <i>expensive</i>, too. His adopted parents must've really worked their <i>asses</i> off to get him in there, <i>and</i> then into Eastward. It's located near New York City--<i>not</i> that far from where those Appleton people lived. <i>(Glances at Jane, who still does not get it:)</i> The <i>Appletons</i>, Jane? You know, the people my bro and your boyfriend apparently might've <i>known</i>? <i>Those</i> Appletons? <i>(Loses a man:)</i> Crap!</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Realizes:)</i> Ohhh, <i>those</i> Appletons. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Sorry for sounding like <i>Brittany</i> there for a second, it can happen to the <i>best</i> of us. What's the <i>connection</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: I don't know--whatever it is, I haven't figured it out yet. <i>(Glances over:)</i> He's coming <i>back</i>, shhh.</p>


     <p>Darren had some tokens and gave them to Daria and Jane, while keeping some for himself.</p>


<p>DARREN: There you all go--<i>(looks around:)</i> I think I'll try those <i>virtual reality simulators</i> first. <i>(Smirks:)</i> Want to come along, Jane?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks as well:)</i> Sure, why not? Let's try the <i>"Underwater Pardise"</i> one --I can sing <i>"Under The Sea"</i> while we battle the evil sea monsters. <i>(Walks over with Darren and tells a geeky-looking, long dark-haired guy what they want, while Daria puts in another token to her game and begins to play again)</i></p>


<p><i>(Note to reader: The simulators were tried by Daria and Ted in the episode "The New Kid")</i></p>


<p><i>(Scene fast-forwards to about two hours later)</i></p>


     <p>Daria and Jane were playing a Star Wars-type of space arcade game called <i>"Nova One"</i> while Darren watched, interested. Both were going at it rather furiously, with the game emphasizing speed through a series of button-crushing moves. There were now more people in the arcade, though still considerably less than usual (most of the students that hung out here were still out with their families on vacation). As an afterthought, Darren looked at his watch, and <i>gawked</i>. Time to call <i>Woo</i>.</p>


<p>DARREN: I'm going to use the uh--<i>restroom</i>, you two--I'll be back.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Frowns while deep in thought, with her tounge sticking out:)</i> Knock yerself out, Darren.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Ever-so-slightly frowns:)</i> Don't let <i>us</i> stop you, bro. <i>(Frowns a little more:) Damn</i>--I <i>hate</i> you, Jane!</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Grins:) Hah</i>! You're in <i>trouble</i> now, amiga--now to go in for the <i>kill</i>!</p>


     <p>Darren gave a small chuckle to himself after watching the girls for a moment more, going into the arcade's men's restroom, and into the farthest stall from the door. He pulled the cell phone from his pocket, opened it up, and began to dial.</p>

     <p>Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, a street over from Woo's detective agency, the red goatee-haired man sat in his tinted glass sportscar eating a sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit, and listening to the sounds from Woo's office. So far, the only things he heard were that of a case that was about a missing <i>parakeet</i> from an elderly woman, and a missing <i>brooch</i> from a wealthy socialite. The man snickered and rolled his eyes, and drank some hot coffee he had poured out of his thermos--this was <i>boring</i> to him, but he did not care--he was getting <i>paid</i> for it, anyway. The man shrugged to himself, sat back, drank the coffee, and continued to listen.</p>

     <p>Carla had a typical morning at Woo's--filing, typing, answering the phone, welcoming a potential client, and getting coffee and bagels for Woo and the client. She <i>sighed</i> when she thought of the coffee and bagels--it reminded her of the time that the very handsome <i>Darren Appleton</i> came by the office almost a month ago with Woo, and she had given them the previously mentioned serving just to get <i>another</i> peek at Darren while he was talking to Woo. Carla had not had that much luck with men, despite her attractive looks--the old adage was true, she supposed: <i>"Good men <b>are</b> hard to find."</i> The ones she met were of the <i>jerkwad</i> variety--they only seemed to <i>want--enough of <B>that</B> thinking, girl</i>. She could not put her finger on it, but something about Darren made her see him as a <i>genuinely</i> good guy. Was it his deep blue <i>eyes</i>? His reddish-brown wavy <i>hair</i>? Those <i>perfect</i> white <i>teeth</i>? Carla smiled to herself over each one of those options, almost forgetting that he also was <i>very wealthy</i> as well--which, in a way, made her feel <i>better</i> about herself. There was more to being involved with a guy than just him having <i>money</i>, although it certainly <i>didn't</i> hurt for him to have some--liking a <i>bum</i> was out of the question. She was shaken out of her dreamy-stupor by the beeping of the phone. Carla pushed the receiver button and answered it.</p> 


<p>CARLA: Woo Detective Agency, may I help you?</p>

<p>VOICE: I certainly <i>hope</i> so. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Is this <i>Carla</i>?</p>

<p>CARLA: <i>(Frowns slightly, perplexed:)</i> Why, yes it is. Who's this?</p>

<p>VOICE: <i>(Sounding friendly:)</i> Hi, Carla--this is <i>Darren Appleton</i>. Is Woo there?</p>

<p>CARLA: <i>(Stunned, now excited:) Darren</i>--I mean, <i>Mr. Appleton</i>? Y-yes, he's in! I'll connect you to him! <i>(Is about to push the button to connect Darren to Woo, pauses:)</i> Um, <i>how</i> are you doing? Did you meet your birth family?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> I'm fine, Carla--and remember, it's just <i>Darren</i>. Yes, I've met and I'm living <i>with</i> them for the summer. Are you doing well?</p>

<p>CARLA: <i>(Very excited now:)</i> Oh yes, Mr.--<i>Darren</i>! I'm fine! Er--I'll connect you to Woo--<i>(grows quiet while pushing the button to reach Woo:)</i> it was--<i>nice</i> talking to you, Darren.</p>

<p>DARREN: You too, Carla.</p>

<p>CARLA: <i>(Sighs contentedly, smiles, with her finger still on the button:) Yeah</i>.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(From his office, sounding amused:) "Yeah", what</i>, Carla?</p>

<p>CARLA: <i>(Now panics, snaps out of it:)</i> Oh, I'm <i>sorry</i>, Woo! I'm on, that is, <i>Darren Appleton's</i> on the phone! Line one!</p>

<p>WOO: Darren Appleton? <i>(Pauses:)</i> I shouldn't be surprised <i>(adds as an playful afterthought, chuckles:)</i> either by him <i>calling</i> me, or you <i>behaving</i> like that <i>when</i> he called. Patch him in.</p> 

<p>CARLA: <i>(After mock-glaring at the phone for a moment:)</i> Here he is, Woo. <i>(Pushes the connecting line)</i></p>


     <p>In the tinted window sportscar, the man nearly <i>spilled</i> the coffee all over himself when he heard Darren Appleton first talk to Carla. He hurriedly turned up the volume on his listening device and narrowed his eyes intently.</p>


<p>WOO: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Hello, Darren. I expected that you'd call me after seeing the NTSB news conference this morning. I saw it as well, and suffice it to say, I'm really <i>not</i> surprised to hear that the NTSB rule that it was an accident.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sounding surprised:) Really</i>? Why?</p>

<p>WOO: That's what whoever hired Sanchez would want us and everyone else <i>to</i> think. Sanchez did one <i>hell</i> of a job with sabotaging that fuel line, I'm <i>sure</i> of it.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sounding quiet:)</i> Ah, of course, you're right. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Do you have any leads yet?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Leans back in his chair, sighs:)</i> We're working on it. There are some <i>rumors</i> that Sanchez is <i>still</i> in the L.A. area, and we're checking them all out. I'm about to go out myself and look as well. <i>(Pauses, looks concerned:)</i> How are <i>you</i> doing?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(After a pause:) Lousy</i>, Woo--I feel as if the walls are <i>closing</i> in on me. The media has <i>harassed</i> my friend Curtis and his girlfriend, my aunt Millie overseas, even the staff at the <i>mansion</i> is getting the same treatment. <i>(Adds:)</i> I can't even trust the <i>security</i> at the mansion or at Appleton Towers, save for my <i>uncle Will, (Woo looks uneasy at this)</i> because someone there might be <i>in</i> on what happened to my parents. Then, of course, there's the <i>lie</i> I'm giving to my birth family. <i>That</i> more than anything else is really <i>bothering</i> me. I'm <i>hating</i> myself for doing this.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Sighs:)</i> I can only <i>imagine</i> what you're going through, Darren, but try to hang in there for a little while longer. The <i>last</i> thing we need is for whoever hired Sanchez to find out about <i>what</i> you're doing, and possibly put you and your birth family in <i>danger</i>, since you're staying with them--</p>

<p>DARREN: --And my <i>girlfriend</i>, Woo. I'm just <i>beside</i> myself for <i>tricking</i> her, too.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Smiles quietly:)</i> Ah, you have a <i>new</i> girlfriend as well? It's good to see you getting on with your life, Darren. <i>(Becomes serious, tries to be reassuring:)</i> We're going to go <i>around</i> the clock on this case, Darren, and I've already gotten two other men working on it. You're <i>safe</i> in Lawndale, so try to remember that--also remember this is to protect your <i>birth family</i> as well.</p>


     <p><i>Jackpot</i>. The man in the car smirked wickedly, and pulled out his cell phone, and began to punch some numbers. Darren Appleton's <i>"safety"</i> was about to be put into <i>questionable jeopardy</i>.</p>



<p><i>(Scene changes back to the arcade, about 5 minutes later)</i></p>



     <p>Daria and Jane had finished their game, (by which Jane had won) and had now started to play another game called <i>"Bop The Teacher"</i>. Both had a large rubber hammer with a wooden handle, and were using them to hit small, mechanized "teachers" that were popping in and out of holes, on a large console, getting points for each "teacher" hit. Obviously, both girls were <i>naturally</i> drawn to this game, which enabled them to work out their <i>frustrations</i> at their mostly <i>inept</i> Lawndale High instructors, even giving each of the pop-up "teachers" the <i>same</i> names as their educational "tormentors". Judging by the <i>worn-out</i> handles on the hammers they were holding, it was quite a <i>popular</i> game to play among the youth in and around Lawndale. Daria was leading this game, 20 to 15.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Swings, smirks:)</i> Take <i>that, "Morris"</i>--that'll teach you to force <i>me</i> to do that jogging crap! <i>(Hits:)</i> Gotcha!</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Swings, smirks:)</i> You're goin' <i>down, "Li"! (Hits:)</i> Hooza!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(While swinging:)</i> Darren's taking an awfully <i>long</i> time, don't you think? Damn--missed <i>"DeMartino"</i>!</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Maybe I oughta <i>check</i>, eh? <i>(Hits:)</i> Oop, there it <i>is, "Phelps"</i>!</p>

<p><i>(Note to reader: Mr. Phelps, a math teacher, is from Kara Wild's wonderful fanfic, "Of Absolute Value"--being Quinn and Jane's math teacher, according to Kara)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Swings again:)</i> You've got a <i>dirty</i> mind, Lane. <i>(Hits:) Burn in hell, "Manson"</i>!</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Swings, sneers:)</i> And your <i>point</i> is--? <i>(The pop-ups stop, she looks at score:)</i> Hmm--you won. <i>(She and Daria give hammers back to arcade man:)</i> Another game?</p>

<p>DARIA: Well, I--</p>

<p>VOICE: <i>(From the side:) Helloooo, laaaaaadies</i>!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks at where the voice came from:)</i> Heads up--here comes the <i>one</i> person we wouldn't want to see in our <i>nightmares</i>--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Arches an eyebrow:)</i> --Or anywhere <i>else</i>, real <i>or</i> imagined. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Maybe we shouldn't have given up those hammers so <i>soon</i>, Daria. <i>(Daria smirks at Jane)</i></p>


     <p><i>Charles Ruttheimer III</i>, better known to the denizens of Lawndale High (and to some on the <i>outside</i> of it, especially at the <i>porno</i> shops) as <i>Upchuck</i>, strolled up in his usual "loverboy" mode to Daria and Jane. He grinned with the look of a hungary <i>tiger</i>, waiting to <i>pounce</i> on its prey--in this case, both of them. Both girls looked at each other, and rolled their eyes in disgust.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> Hey, Upchuck--we see you've returned from your vacation with your family--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:)</i> --Yeah--when are you going <i>back</i>?</p>

<p>UPCHUCK: <i>Grrrrrr--fiesty</i>! Nay, me and my folks have just come back from Hawaii, and we're here for the rest of the summer! <i>(Puts his hand on his chest:)</i> Both of you can now have the <i>'Ol Chuckster</i> to yourselves! I've returned, and I'm a <i>raaarin'</i> to go! You gals have entered into my <i>lair</i>, and now you should consider yourselves <i>caught</i>! Rrrrrr!</p>

<p>DARIA: I don't recall us entering <i>willingly</i> into your <i>"lair"</i>--you obviously have us confused with someone or <i>something</i> else. Maybe with your <i>real</i> female companions--like, say, the <i>gorillas</i>?</p>

<p>JANE: Yeah, you're in the <i>wrong</i> place, <i>"Chucky-boy"--(points:)</i> though it probably wouldn't be <i>fair</i> to the female apes for us to do this, I must inform you the <i>zoo's</i> in <i>that</i> direction. Go, and find your <i>true</i> love.</p>

<p>UPCHUCK: <i>(Whines, stretches out his arms:)</i> Aw, c'moooon, you <i>luscious</i> lovelies! If you come with me on a <i>date</i>, I can give you what any gal could only <i>dream</i> of--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:) --Two</i> things come right off the top of my head--your declaring that you're gonna become <i>celibate</i> forever, and your deciding to be also <i>castrated</i> to <i>enforce</i> your celibacy. (Pauses while Jane tries to hold back her laughter:)</i> Sorry, Upchuck, we're with someone <i>else</i>--use your little "pick-up" line elsewhere.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Sneers:)</i> Why don't you go to the <i>dump</i>? You can "pick up" <i>anything</i> there.</p>


     <p>Darren came out of the restroom after putting his cell phone back in his pants pocket, feeling at least a little more comfortable by Woo's assurances over finding Sanchez than before. He immediately saw a grinning, scrawny and <i>sleezy</i> looking, freckled-face, short, reddish-(almost orange-colored in nature) haired teenager that looked like a cross between <i>Howdy-Doody</i> and <i>Alfred E. Neumann</i> (of <i>Mad</i> magazine) talking to Daria and Jane in the center of the arcade. Darren noticed that both girls looked slightly <i>agitated</i>, as if the fellow were giving them a hard time. Frowning slightly, more out of confusion than anger, he went over to see what was going on. Jane saw Darren coming out of the corner of her eye and smirked.</p>


<p>UPCHUCK: Ladies, ladies, ladies! If you're worrying that there's not <i>enough</i> of me to go <i>around</i>, I can promise you that your concerns are <i>overblown</i>!</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Still smirks, watches Darren coming over, which now also catches Daria's eye:)</i> I have a feeling that <i>you're</i> gonna be <i>blown over</i> and <i>around</i> all over the <i>floor</i> of the arcade, Upchuck, if you don't leave.</p>

<p>UPCHUCK: <i>(Smug, puts up his index finger, waves it in a admonishing manner:) Ah-ah-ah</i>, Ms. Lane--this is a <i>public</i> facility. You simply cannot <i>kick</i> me out, my dear.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Watches Darren come up, smirks:) He</i> can.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow, looks Upchuck over:)</i> Everything <i>okay</i>, you two?</p>

<p>UPCHUCK: <i>(Eyes Darren warily:)</i> And who, pray tell, are <i>you</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>My</i> name's Darren. I'm Daria's big brother, and Jane's boyfriend. <i>(Narrows his eyes down at Upchuck:) You</i>--?</p>

<p>UPCHUCK: <i>(Stunned, searches for words:)</i> Uh, ah, excuse me, but did you s-say that you were the l-lovely Daria's b-big <i>b-brother</i>--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Grins:)</i> --And <i>my</i> boyfriend.</p>

<p>UPCHUCK: <i>(Still tries to comprehend, looks between the three:) H-how--b-but--</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:) --Long</i> story, Upchuck--but it <i>is</i> true--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Nods her head slowly, smirks:)</i> --Every <i>bit</i> of it, "Chuckie". <i>(Holds her right hand up as if she is going to testify in a courtroom:) Swear</i> it is.</p>

<p>UPCHUCK: <i>(Turns a little green after seeing the broad-shouldered Darren glaring at him:)</i> I-I think I'll be <i>going</i> now. <i>(Backs away:)</i> N-nice to <i>meet</i> you, Darren--<i>sir. (Quickly leaves the arcade)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Watches Upchuck go, then turns back to Daria and Jane:)</i> Excuse me, but did you just call him--<i>"Upchuck"</i>, Daria?</p>

<p>DARIA: Um-hmm. His <i>real</i> name is <i>Charles</i>, and how he got the name "Upchuck" is a story within itself--<i>somewhat. (Looks at her watch:)</i> If you guys are game, we can talk about it over at <i>Pizza King</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Rolls her eyes:) Please</i>, Daria--can't we talk about "The Chuckster" in Darren's car <i>before</i> we chow down? I don't wanna risk losing my <i>lunch</i> while we're talking about him <i>and</i> eating, okay? <i>(Darren chuckles)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shrugs, smirks:)</i> Fair enough, I suppose--<i>(pauses:)</i> of course, you <i>do</i> realize that just <i>thinking</i> about him after we talk in the car might not make you  want to <i>eat</i> a pizza by the time we get there?</p> 

<p>JANE: I'll take that chance, m'dear. <i>(Hooks her arm with Darren's, and both leave with Daria, while some of the girls with their dates <b>swoon</b> at Darren and <b>glare</b> at Jane out of jealousy)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the Appleton Towers, the meeting room)</i></p>



     <p>William Appleton was meeting with some Saudi businessmen at one end of the table with his secretary Lilly while Benny Lodell was sitting on the other end talking on his cell phone in a low voice, alone. He looked <i>stunned</i>.</p> 


<p>BENNY: --And you're <i>sure</i> about Darren Appleton asking about <i>Sanchez</i> to Woo?</p>

<p>VOICE: Yessir, <i>no</i> doubt about that. Darren Appleton <i>hired</i> Woo to find out if the crash was an accident, and Woo knows apparently that it <i>wasn't</i> one, which <i>confirms</i> Mr. Appleton's fears. Woo's agency is trying to <i>locate</i> Sanchez even as we speak--Woo told Darren Appleton that his agency is <i>following</i> several leads.</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Narrows his eyes, then in a whisper, sarcastic:) Damn</i>--this is just--<i>great</i>! All right, anything else?</p>

<p>VOICE: No sir, not at the moment. You want me to <i>continue</i> to monitor Woo's office?</p>

<p>BENNY: Yes. Inform me <i>immediately</i> if something else comes up concerning Sanchez, got that?</p>

<p>VOICE: Yessir. <i>(Hangs up)</i></p>


     <p>Benny clicked off his cell phone and glanced over at William, who had caught Benny's serious-looking gaze. Benny mouthed, <i>"Trouble, Boss"</i>, and William took his cue, looking over at the businessmen, interrupting one of them.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: Would you <i>excuse</i> me a moment, gentleman? My--<i>associate</i> wishes to speak to me. I'd like to ask you to consider the offer Appleton's making to help you lay that pipeline near <i>Mecca</i>--it's quite affordable, I can <i>assure</i> you. <i>(The Saudi businessmen nod, and William gets up and goes to the other end of the table to Benny)</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Sits down beside Benny, in a low voice:)</i> You said, "Trouble, Boss"--what is it?</p>


     <p>Benny leaned over and whispered what the man who was bugging Woo's office told him in William's ear. William's face suddenly <i>contorted</i> into a brief look of pure <i>rage</i>, something that the Saudi businessmen noticed, and looked at William with a bit of <i>fear</i> in their faces. William promptly saw how the businessmen looked at him, and he quickly changed his attitude, addressing them in a <i>pacifying</i> tone.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Laughs uneasily:) Heh</i>--I didn't mean to <i>alarm</i> you all with the look of my <i>countenance</i>, gentlemen. My associate just informed me that a--<i>(looks for words:) problem</i> has developed with one of our--<i>employees</i>. You know how it is, with good help being so <i>hard</i> to find, and such.</p>


     <p>This explanation actually seemed to go over <i>well</i> with the Saudi businessmen, for they began to smile, looked at each other, talked in Arabic, and went back to their consideration over taking Appleton's offer. The moment they had taken their eyes off William, he leaned over to Benny and spoke in a low voice.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: <i>Damn</i> Darren <i>and</i> Woo--<i>(frowns, realizes something:)</i> and for that matter, <i>myself. (Benny looks at William, perplexed)</i> I should've <i>remembered</i> that my brother and Lucille were practically <i>obsessed</i> with going over our jet fleet with a fine <i>toothcomb</i> when it came to flight checks--<i>company policy</i>, remember. <i>(Benny now has realized what William's talking about, nods)</i> Lucille lost her <i>uncle</i> when she was young in a plane crash, and she <i>moaned</i> and <i>groaned</i> over it to my dear brother for <i>years</i>. I should have <i>known</i> my <i>nosy "nephew"</i> would've checked just in case. Tell our man on standby to <i>go</i> to this--<i>"Lawndale". (Benny grins wickedly)</i> I want him to <i>spy</i> on my <i>so-called "nephew"</i>, and to get a <i>lay</i> of the area. Tell him to do <i>nothing</i> to Darren, to just <i>observe</i> for now--and continue to get any <i>details</i> on Darren's birth family. Darren <i>still</i> doesn't know if <i>I</i> was involved in his <i>"parents"</i> deaths, though for some reason, I think Woo <i>may</i> in one way or another, suspect <i>me</i>. Don't ask me <i>why</i>--I just have this <i>feeling</i>--and you <i>know</i> my <i>"hunches"</i> are generally almost always <i>right. (Pauses, looks concerned:)</i> Where in the <i>hell</i> is <i>Sanchez</i>? Why hasn't he called you yet? <i>Surely</i> he's <i>seen</i> the news conference.</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> I don't know, Boss--maybe he's just <i>biding</i> his time, waiting until he's <i>certain</i> the coast is clear.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Frowns slightly:)</i> I suppose I can <i>understand</i> him doing that, but he'd better not wait <i>too</i> long to contact you--the way Woo operates, Sanchez <i>will</i> be located, and we simply <i>can't</i> allow that--<i>(then adds as a wicked afterthought:) if</i> you know what I mean.</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Nods slowly, gets the gist of William's inference:) Right</i>, 
Boss--anything else?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: Not at the moment, Benny. I'm getting back to those Saudi businessmen and close this deal.</p> 

<p>BENNY: Okay, Boss--I'll call our man to go to this <i>"Lawndale"</i> place and watch your <i>"nephew". (William gives him a quick, smug, evil smirk, gets up, and goes back to the businessmen, while Benny punches the numbers in his cell phone)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene goes back to Lawndale)</i></p>



     <p>Over the next day-and-a-half, Daria, Jane, and Darren spent some time together during the day, with Daria and Darren reading in the public library some more (spending several hours together, getting to know one another, or what Darren <i>allowed</i> Daria to know), and Darren and Jane going out to the movies or to a burger/pizza place at night (Daria said that she wanted them to spend some time together without her there <i>all</i> of the time). Jane had produced a small clay sculpture of a jogging Darren that she showed to a very-flattered Darren and a smirking Daria. Jane also did some <i>sketches</i> of Darren while he was out with her after they finished jogging together--more <i>"artistic inspiration"</i>, Daria suspected. On the side, Daria and Jane privately speculated some more as to what seemed to have <i>bothered</i> Darren, coming up with no additional conclusions at the moment, though Daria noticed that Darren did seem a <i>little</i> more comfortable in his demeanor. Darren also promised both he'd come to <i>McGrundy's</i> for Mystik Spiral's appropiately-titled <i>"Return to the Fold Concert at McGrudy's"</i> that Friday.</p>
     
     	<p>Meanwhile, Quinn was being <i>punished</i> by her mother (backed up by Jake) because of Quinn's opening of the envelope that had the overall DNA results on Darren--Helen wanted to <i>"teach her a lesson about going through other people's mail without their permission"</i>. As a result, Quinn would <i>not</i> be allowed to go out on any dates for the weekend, something that of course, had Quinn in a whiny and angry mood, claiming to having <i>"worked"</i> hard to regain her <i>"popular-among-the-boys"</i> reputation, only to see it <i>"stifled"</i> by her mom <i>"being unreasonable"</i>. Darren spent time with Quinn by going over the classes Quinn would take in her junior year at Lawndale High, as well as the current fashion trends (much to Darren's private <i>chagrin</i>--more boredom). It was during this session that Quinn came up with what even Daria and Jane had to admit was <i>brilliant</i>--especially for Quinn (if they had known)--she asked (<i>conned</i> by her charm) a reluctant Darren to speak on her behalf when he and her mom went out mid-week on their lunch "date", knowing that her brother's affect on her mother could change the tide in <i>her</i> favor.</p>

     <p>Between all of this, Darren had spent some more time with Jake at the Sedimentary Rock Country Club and Links, (Jake took a half-day off) <i>again</i> allowing Jake to win the match, although Jake had his <i>own</i> suspicions as to whether or not his son was doing so, especially after they ran into Jake's competitive "tormentor", Calvin Hopkins, and a friend, on the green. A friendly little <i>"wager"</i> was made for the rest of the holes, and a match-play competition was born. Darren shot a 72 (even par) on the course, and with Jake's score of 81, <i>easily</i> defeated a now-angry Hopkins, who <i>threw</i> his bag of clubs into a pond near the 18th green. When Jake asked Darren how Darren could play so <i>well</i> against Hopkins and his friend (not that Jake was complaining, mind you), but <i>not</i> against Jake <i>himself</i>, Darren merely shrugged his shoulders and said that Jake's brand of play <i>"kind of intimidated"</i> him. A now-beaming Jake patted his son on the back, and assured a kindly smiling Darren not to <i>"cower"</i> to his <i>"Ol' Dad"</i> on the golf course in the future, to which Darren <i>reluctantly</i> agreed to.</p> 

     <p>On Wednesday, Darren had arrived at the law firm of <i>Vitale, Davis, Horowitz, Riordan, Schrecter, Schrecter, and Schrecter</i>, meeting every one of Helen's co-workers, including her boss, <i>Eric Schrecter</i>. Marianne was <i>stunned</i> (surprise) at how handsome Helen's son looked, and privately, though briefly, <i>cursed</i> herself for being <i>married</i> and having <i>children</i>. Helen also had showed her office to Darren, and had told him of what cases they were working on. Darren was sitting by Helen's desk reading the newspaper while she was finishing up some court documents so they could then go to lunch. Helen occasionally glanced at her son <i>lovingly</i> while watching him read--it sort of reminded her of seeing <i>Jake</i> doing the same thing. She sighed, and went back to her work. The phone rang, and Marianne answered it while typing.</p>


<p>MARIANNE: Hello?</p>

<p>VOICE: <i>(Masculine, very heavy:)</i> Hello, does a <i>Helen Morgendorffer</i> work there?</p>

<p>MARIANNE: Yes, she does, one moment, ple--<i>(phone clicks off)</i> Hello? <i>Hello</i>?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Looks up from her work, while Darren looks over his paper:)</i> Someone on the phone, Marianne?</p>

<p>MARIANNE: <i>(While hanging the phone up:)</i> Somebody asked if you were here, Helen, then they <i>suddenly</i> hung up. In all my time here, I've <i>never</i> had <i>that</i> happen to me before.</p>

<p>HELEN: Hmmm--well, perhaps the <i>power</i> went out or something from <i>their</i> end of the line. If they really want me, they'll call back. <i>(Looks at her watch, gets up:) Oh</i>, my! We'd better get a move on, Darren--do you mind if we go to a new restaurant called <i>Milligan's</i>? I've heard that it serves a <i>delicious</i> beef entree. Marianne, page me if Eric needs me--are you staying <i>here</i> for lunch?</p>

<p>MARIANNE: <i>(Thought v.o.: With all of the <b>work</b> you <b>usually</b> leave me? Do I have any choice <b>but</b> to stay here?) (Holds up her lunch bag:)</i> Yes, Helen, have a good time, you two.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gets up, folds the paper:) Milligan's</i> it is, let's go. <i>(Smiles:)</i> It was nice meeting you, Marianne. <i>(Leaves with Helen)</i></p>

<p>MARIANNE: <i>(Smiles back:)</i> You too, Darren. <i>(Though v.o. as she watches Darren leave with Helen: Whoa, mama--that "Jane" is one <b>lucky</b> gal!)</i></p>


     <p>The 10 minute trip to <i>Milligan's</i> was uneventful, though Helen did notice that Darren seemed deep in <i>thought</i> over something. She thought about <i>asking</i> him, but decided to wait until both were in the restaurant to ask.</p>

     <p>Behind them, another car, a gray-colored Camry, was <i>following</i> them from a distance.</p>

     <p>When they arrived at <i>Milligan's</i>, Helen and Darren were led to and seated near the middle of the nearly-full restaurant. The place was one of those <i>"anything crazy-looking on the wall"</i> eating establishments, with such items as old bike tires, a hat, and even a <i>car bumper</i>! Darren cocked an eyebrow at that <i>particular</i> item. Ricky Martin's <i>She's All I Ever Had</i> was playing low on the speakers. Both read the menus and began to order, with Helen asking for the beef shish kebab, and Darren the club sandwich. Helen then looked over at Darren and <i>hesitated</i> for a moment. Darren noticed her reluctance, and initiated the conversation.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Gives a quiet smile:)</i> Something bothering you, <i>Helen</i>?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Thought v.o., sighs privately to herself: Other than the fact that you're <b>still</b> calling me <b>"Helen"</b>, son?)</i> It's funny you should ask <i>me</i> that, Darren--I was going to ask <i>you</i> the <i>same</i> question. You seemed--to be thinking <i>far off</i> for some reason, like something was on your mind.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Slightly surprised, chuckles uneasily:)</i> Was I <i>that</i> obvious? Oh, I--guess I'm just--thinking about the <i>great</i> time I'm having here being with you all, that's it.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Narrows her eyes a bit, still not totally convinced:)</i> Darren, are you <i>sure</i> that's it? You can talk to me in <i>confidence</i> if you want to--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Grins:)</i> --Oh, you mean like a <i>lawyer</i>? <i>(Helen rolls her eyes playfully)</i> There's <i>nothing</i> wrong. <i>(Thought v.o.: <b>Liar</b>.)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Looks at him a second more:)</i> Well, all right, son, but you <i>know</i> you can talk to me and <i>(hesitates:)</i> your <i>father</i> anytime.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles, reaches his hand across the table to Helen's:)</i> I know, and I <i>thank you</i> for that--I <i>mean</i> it.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Blushes slightly:)</i> I--just--I just wanted you to know that Jake and I really feel like we want to be a part of your <i>life</i> from now on. <i>(Darren gives a wistful smile)</i> Daria and Quinn really are beginning to <i>bond</i> with you, and you and <i>Jane</i> are--<i>(looks for words:)</i> well, getting--<i>closer</i> to one another. <i>(Darren chuckles)</i></p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Still holds Helen's hand, in a quiet tone, takes a deep breath:)</i> 
I--I'd <i>like</i> for you and Jake to be a part of my life like Daria and Quinn--<i>(pauses:)</i> and <i>Jane</i> are beginning to be. <i>(Looks a little uncomfortable, pauses:)</i> I--<i>hope</i> that you and Jake can <i>understand</i> certain--<i>"things"</i> about me, things that I hope you can <i>overlook</i>--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Frowns, perplexed:) --"Things"</i>, son? <i>What</i> "things"? <i>(Pauses:)</i> Does this have anything to do what happened to your--um, <i>parents</i>? <i>(Darren looks stunned)</i> You haven't said anything more <i>about</i> them, other than they died in an <i>accident</i>. I can only <i>imagine</i> what you've gone through, son--maybe you can talk about <i>how</i> they were, and what <i>happened</i> to them--?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Now tries to find words:)</i> Well, uh--that is--I--</p>

<p>VOICE: <i>(From the side, with a bit of a sneer:)</i> Now, <i>this</i> is an <i>interesting</i> sight, Helen--anything I should <i>know</i> about?</p> 


     <p>Helen looked in the direction of the remark, and saw <i>Linda Griffin</i> standing in front of her, and behind Darren, smirking.</p> 


<p>HELEN: <i>(Gets up with Darren, puts on her gameface:) Ohhhh, Lindaaa</i>! Hellooo! Where did you come from? <i>(Thought v.o.: From under a <b>rock</b>, perhaps?)</i></p>

<p>LINDA: <i>(Grins like the cat that swallowed the canary:)</i> Oh, I'm here from my job with <i>Sandi</i> for lunch. She went to the restroom when we first came in. <i>(Does a double-take when she sees Darren turn around to face her, gasps:)</i> And who are <i>you</i>, young man? <i>(Thought v.o.: <b>Damn</b>! I have to admit, when Helen finally decided to <b>cheat</b> on Jake, she <b>really</b> cheated! This fellow's, like so <b>fine</b>--and just the <b>right</b> age for a <b>fling</b>, too.)</i></p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Extends his hand:)</i> Er, hello, I'm--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Jumps in:)</i> --This is Darren, my <i>son. (Linda looks confused for a moment, but <b>not</b> necessarily shocked, shakes hands with Darren)</i> I'm surprised Sandi <i>didn't</i> tell you about him--after all, he's been here with us for about a <i>month</i>, now. <i>(Pauses, realizes:)</i> As a matter of fact, I haven't heard <i>anything</i> from you concerning <i>meeting</i> my son. <i>(Thought v.o., smirks to herself: Maybe you'd feel <b>overwhelmed</b> by meeting him--like you <b>just</b> were, hmmm?)</i></p>

<p>LINDA: <i>(While Sandi is now coming up from behind and beside her, and gives a small, dreamy smirk when she spots Darren, who looks at her stoically:)</i> First of all, Helen, I have been <i>quite</i> busy with my vice-presidential marketing job at KSBC, getting <i>record</i> advertising revenues for the station for this quarter--as <i>usual. (Helen rolls her eyes)</i> Secondly, this is the <i>first</i> time I've heard that you <i>have</i> a son. <i>(Helen looks surprised)</i> Thirdly, Sandi told me that Darren was your <i>nephew</i>.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Now shocked, wide-eyed:) WHAT</i>?! <i>(People in the restaurant look at them, Helen calms down) W-what</i> did you say?</p> 

<p>LINDA: <i>(Looks at Helen disdainfully:)</i> You <i>heard</i> me--your <i>nephew</i>. Isn't that <i>right</i>, Sandi?</p>

<p>SANDI: Like, that is so <i>true</i>. Darren said that he was Quinn's <i>cousin</i>, and Quinn like, <i>confirmed</i> it, or something.</p>


     <p>All eyes converged on <i>Darren</i>, who was looking <i>up</i> at the <i>ceiling</i>.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(After a moment, looks back down on the others:)</i> Well, uh, that's true, I <i>did</i>, but it was meant to be something of a <i>joke</i> on <i>Quinn</i>, and--well--she asked me to <i>continue</i> it. I really <i>didn't</i> want to, but to Quinn, it seemed to be <i>important</i>.</p> 

<p>HELEN: <i>(Frowns, perplexed:) "Joke"</i>, Darren? I don't understand.</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Ditto:)</i> Yeah, like I don't either.</p>

<p>LINDA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> This I'd like to <i>hear. (Looks at Helen:)</i> Do you mind of we eat <i>with</i> you two, Helen?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Looks uneasily at an uncomfortable-looking Darren, sits down with Linda, Sandi:)</i> I--don't--see why not.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Grimaces, sits down slowly:)</i> Ah, it's like <i>this</i>--you see--</p>


     <p>Helen's rage began to <i>grow</i> after she heard the story from Darren about the incident when Darren and Quinn met the Fashion Club for the first time in the Pizza King, and the aftermath of claiming Daria was her "cousin" all around school. Linda smirked, and Sandi shook her head slowly, then formed a <i>gradual</i> smirk on her face, something that <i>Darren</i> noticed. During this time, they were all served, and had eaten.</p>


<p>HELEN: <i>(Red-faced:)</i> How <i>DARE</i> Quinn do something like <i>that</i>--saying that Daria was her <i>"cousin"</i> to her friends! If she thought the <i>envelope-opening incident</i> was <i>something</i>, wait'll I get <i>home</i>! She'll be <i>grounded</i> for the <i>rest</i> of the summer!</p>

<p>LINDA: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> It seems to <i>me</i> Helen, that this was the result of bad <i>parental</i> guidance! <i>(Helen glares at Linda)</i> You need to instill <i>stern</i> discipline in your children like <i>I</i> have with <i>Sandi</i>--for <i>shame</i>, Helen! <i>(Helen looks for the words to speak, but can't, so Darren intercedes)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: No offense, Mrs. Griffin, but <i>I'm</i> just as much to <i>blame</i> as Quinn, if not <i>more</i> so. I helped to <i>perpetuate</i> her saying that <i>lie</i> to your daugther.</p>


     <p>Inwardly, Sandi Griffin was as <i>happy</i> as she had <i>ever</i> been in a long time. This was <i>perfect</i>--an <i>excuse</i> to get <i>rid</i> of Quinn's influence in the Fashion Club. Quinn had <i>lied</i> to her and the Fashion Club about Darl--<i>Daria</i> being her cousin when in fact, she was Quinn's <i>sister. This was just too, too bad--looks like a new vice-president was going to have to be found. Tiffany? Perfect "yes-man". Stacy? Perfect doormat. Someone else, possibly Brooke? Her nose had long since been repaired</i>. She'd have to consider this carefully.</p>


<p><i>(Note to reader: Before Brooke's nose caved into her face in the episode "Too Cute", she was considered to be a <b>strong</b> candidate to replace Quinn)</i></p>


<p>HELEN: Now, Darren, don't try to <i>defend</i> Quinn--this--<i>"cousin"</i> thing had happened <i>long</i> before you came into our lives--</p>

<p>DARREN: --I'm <i>not</i> defending her. I <i>favor</i> a punishment of some sort, just that it shouldn't be so, well, <i>harsh. (Sees Helen looking at him, ponders:)</i> I'm just asking you to <i>think</i> about it, okay?</p>

<p>LINDA: <i>(Gets up with Sandi:) Hmmph</i>--well, why shouldn't I be <i>surprised</i> that you'd <i>ease up</i> on her, Helen? <i>(Now Darren glares at her with Helen)</i> This has been an--<i>enlightening</i> experience. Come on, Sandi.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gets up suddenly:)</i> Uh, may I <i>talk</i> to you for a minute, Sandi?</p> 

<p>SANDI: <i>(Arches an eyebrow, then after a moment:)</i> Like, I suppose. Mother, will you excuse us?</p>

<p>LINDA: Very well, Sandi--I'll pay for both of us, and I'll be out in the car. <i>(Looks at Helen, speaks coldly:) Helen. (Leaves)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(To Helen:)</i> I'll be back in a few. <i>(Leaves with Sandi while Helen looks at them go, then stares off into space, depressed over Quinn's actions)</i></p>


<p><i>(Note to reader: Any "similarities" between this fic and Kara Wild's fic "The Tie That Chokes" concerning the "cousin" thing being uncovered between Daria and Quinn are purely coincidental--there, I feel <b>better</b> now.)</i></p>


     <p>Both went to a hallway that lead off to the restrooms. Sandi followed Darren in, then folded her arms and leaned back against the wall, looking up intently at Darren.</p>


<p>SANDI: Like, what do you want, Darren?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(In a low voice:)</i> I saw <i>how</i> you looked when you heard that Quinn lied to you and your friends about Daria being her "cousin", and not her sister. <i>(Pauses:)</i> May I <i>assume</i> that this means Quinn's going to be <i>ousted</i>, not only as the Fashion Club's vice-president, but out, <i>period</i>?</p>


     <p>Sandi stared at Darren for a second, inwardly impressed at his ability to see the <i>obvious</i>, then spoke.</p>


<p>SANDI: It's, like out of <i>my</i> hands, Darren--<i>(narrows her eyes:)</i> do you think a <i>lie</i> should be <i>ignored</i>?</p>


     <p>Darren shuddered privately at the <i>irony</i> of Sandi's words. He briefly found himself wondering for some reason what <i>Daria</i> would think of all of the irony.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>No</i>, not by any means. I'm asking that you go <i>easy</i> on Quinn--</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Smirks, cuts him off:)</i> --Like your <i>mother</i>? <i>Why</i> should I? Quinn's been nothing but a <i>thorn--(catches herself:)</i> uh, like, she's <i>mislead</i> us. How do we know if she's done the same thing with <i>fashion</i>, you know, like matching the right <i>halter-top</i> with a matching set of <i>shoes</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Thought v.o.: <b>What</b>? Is that <b>all</b> these girls ever <b>think</b> about?:)</i> Look, I think you and I <i>know</i> that Quinn knows her fashions--<i>(then adds as he sees Sandi frown:)</i> like <i>you</i> do. <i>(Sandi then gives him an approving smirk)</i> Isn't there <i>some</i> way we can work this out, you know, so as <i>not</i> to kick Quinn out of the Fashion Club? She <i>needs</i> to have the Fashion Club's experience on her <i>transcript</i> for the Fashion Institute.</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Now interested a little:)</i> Like, what do you <i>suggest</i>, Darren?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Thinks for a moment, looks around a bit:)</i> Ah, how about some <i>money</i>? I could contribute to your club a small <i>"donation"</i>, or something--how about it?</p>


     <p>Sandi thought about this for a second, then began to get a <i>calculating</i> smirk on her face.</p>


<p>SANDI: <i>No</i>, I'm <i>not</i> interested in a donation--we have like, <i>more</i> than enough money. <i>Buuut--(walks slowly up to Darren, then puts her finger <b>seductively</b> onto his chest, which makes him slightly flinch back:)</i> maybe we can work out something <i>else</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Narrows his eyes, begins to realize:)</i> Oh--and what exactly <i>is</i> this <i>"something else"</i>?</p>

<p>SANDI: I'll keep Quinn in the Fashion Club <i>with</i> her position and--<i>(gives a small snicker:) convince</i> Tiffany and Stacy to do the same--<i>if</i> you go out on a <i>date</i> with me this Friday night. <i>(Smirks:)</i> Do we have like, a <i>deal</i>?</p>


     <p>Though he knew what Sandi was eventually leading up <i>to</i>, it was still a <i>shock</i> to actually <i>hear</i> the offer. After a long moment, he looked down at Sandi, and sighed. Remember, this was for <i>Quinn, Quinn, Quinn</i>.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks resigned, sighs:) Deal. (Sandi grins triumphantly) (Thought v.o.: Jane's <b>not</b> going to like this.)</i></p>
