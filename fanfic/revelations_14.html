<p>Chapter 14-Distant Rumblings</p>




<p><i>(The scene is at the Lane's--about 30 minutes later, Jane's room)</i></p>



<p>JANE: <i>(Scowls:)</i> You--did--<i>WHAT</i>?!</p>


     <p>Darren, who had come directly from taking Helen back to her job after lunch, had now stopped by the Lane's where Daria was visiting Jane, sat in a chair, while Daria was sitting on Jane's bed, who was just as stunned listening to what her brother was saying as Jane was. Jane was standing in the middle of her room.</p> 


<p>DARREN: <i>(Gingerly tries to find the right words:)</i> I said--I agreed to take <i>Sandi</i> out on a <i>date</i> this Friday night.</p> 

<p>JANE: <i>(Attempts to keep her composure:)</i> And run this by me <i>again</i> as to <i>why</i> you're doing this, Darren?</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sighs:)</i> To keep Quinn in the Fashion Club. She needs to have that experience on her transcript for admission to the Fashion Institute.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Nods her head slowly, tries to comprehend like Daria is doing as well:)</i> I see--and all this came about <i>by--</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: It all started <i>innocently</i> enough--Helen and I were talking at that new restaurant <i>Milligan's</i> during lunchtime after I picked her up from her job, and Sandi and her mother Linda Griffin had walked in. Well, Helen introduced me as her <i>son</i>, something that Mrs. Griffin and Sandi did <i>not</i> know. <i>(Jane looks at him, confused)</i> You remember about what happened at the Pizza King when I first met the Fashion Club with Quinn? <i>(Jane nods, and Daria's smirk grows <b>wicked</b> at remembering the incident)</i> Anyway, Linda and Sandi had been under the impression that I was Quinn's <i>cousin</i>--something that I <i>helped</i> Sandi and her friends to believe, I'm afraid, trying to follow Quinn's wishes, which is why I feel kind of <i>guilty</i>. From the introductions, one thing led to another, and well, Helen now knows about Quinn telling everyone in your school that Daria was her cousin.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(After a moment:) Uh-huh</i>. What did Helen <i>do</i> about Quinn?</p>

<p>DARREN: On our way back to her job, she was still trying to <i>decide</i>. I asked her to go <i>easy</i> on Quinn <i>(Daria narrows her eyes at her bro, which he sees)</i>. Come <i>on</i>, sis. I'm not saying Helen and Jake shouldn't <i>punish</i> Quinn, I'm just saying that the punishment should <i>fit</i> the crime, and not go <i>beyond</i> that.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Arches an eyebrow:)</i> And what <i>kind</i> of punishment are we talking about that should it not go <i>"beyond"</i>--?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Ponders:)</i> Hmmm--how about that Quinn be <i>forced</i> to admit before the <i>whole</i> school that you're her <i>sister</i>--that's a pretty <i>tough</i> punishment right there, facing down your <i>peers</i>. Quinn should either <i>announce</i> it in the auditorium at the start of your school year, or be forced to <i>pay</i> the money you say that she's been saving for making <i>prints</i> of <i>fliers</i> that <i>proclaim</i> you as being her sister to pass around to her fellow classmates. That's what I plan to <i>suggest</i> to Helen and Jake, though they <i>still</i> would probably want to administer their <i>own</i> sort of punishment to her at home, which I'm guessing will be something to do with her dating and fashions.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Say, that's a pretty good suggestion for a punishment--<i>(looks at Daria:)</i> it would be <i>worth</i> it to see Quinn admit before the <i>entire</i> student body that you're her sister, Daria--hell, I could take a <i>picture</i> of her <i>shocked</i> look, and paint her <i>angst-ridden</i> face--<i>(adds:)</i> on a <i>canvas</i>, that is--<i>she</i> paints her <i>own</i> face with her mascara, lipstick, and eye-liner as you well know. <i>(Smirks while Darren chuckles)</i></p>


     <p>Daria stared at the two for a moment, then sighed.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> I suppose it would be a good idea--though I would've preferred her to be <i>flogged</i>. I'll back you up on that, bro.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Thanks, sis.</p>

<p>JANE: Okay--was Quinn at your home when Darren came back from taking Helen back to her job, Daria?</p>

<p>DARIA: Nope. She left with Stacy to go to <i>Cashman's</i> about 10 minutes after Big Bro left to see mom, and hasn't been back since--said something about new shoes that <i>"had to be seen to be believed". (Smirks:)</i> I wonder if she'll <i>believe</i> the <i>punishment</i> she's gonna be getting soon. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I wonder if mom will <i>page</i> her while Quinn is out, and tell Quinn to be waiting at home when mom and dad get there from work, or just <i>spring</i> it on her when they get in? It should make for one <i>hell</i> of a <i>reality check</i> for Quinn. Maybe I'll need to buy some <i>snacks</i> when I watch her little world come crashing down <i>on</i> her? <i>(Jane chuckles while Darren shakes his head slowly)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(After a moment:)</i> You're really going to <i>enjoy</i> seeing Quinn <i>"get her's"</i>, aren't you, Daria? <i>(Jane looks at Darren, inquisitive, along with Daria)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>Shouldn't</i> I, Darren? Quinn's had a lot of things go <i>her</i> way for as long as I can remember, and now the <i>"Chickens have come home to roost". (Frowns slightly:)</i> You're <i>damn</i> right I'm going to <i>enjoy</i> it. <i>(Jane raises her eyebrows, surprised at Daria's slightly bitter-sounding outburst)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Pauses, then continues:)</i> You know, sis, it seems to me that <i>you</i> should shoulder at least a <i>little</i> of the blame for Quinn's soon-to-be current trouble. <i>(Daria and Jane stare at Darren <b>incredulously</b>)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: Darren, <i>how</i> can you <i>say</i> that? Do you <i>know</i> what Quinn's done <i>to</i> me, mom and dad, our relatives, and just about everyone <i>else</i> most of my life?</p>


     <p>As soon as Daria had finished her words, Jane looked at her and winced, and Daria immediately wished she could take them back. Darren simply stared at her expressionlessly, then spoke in a quiet tone.</p>
 

<p>DARREN: No, I <i>never</i> had the <i>chance</i>, sis. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Look, what I'm saying is that you <i>allowed</i> Quinn to keep doing the <i>"cousin"</i> thing to you. If you had <i>wanted</i> to, you could have <i>confronted</i> Quinn <i>way</i> back then and told her to <i>knock</i> it off. Remember, you <i>finally</i> drew the line when she tried to <i>manipulate</i> you into passing yourself off as <i>my</i> cousin. <i>(Sighs:)</i> I found myself <i>falling</i> for Quinn's charms like everyone else--partly because I found myself wanting to establish a <i>bond</i> with her so <i>desperately</i> like I did with <i>you</i> and my birth parents. <i>You</i>, on the other hand, had developed a <i>resistance</i> to her because you <i>knew</i> her. Perhaps you felt that it wasn't <i>worth</i> it--to <i>fight</i> her, that it was <i>beneath</i> you, and maybe it <i>wasn't</i> worth it, I have <i>no</i> idea, obviously. All I know is, while Quinn <i>does</i> deserve to be punished, <i>(hesitates:) I</i> wouldn't take any <i>pleasure</i> in seeing her punished like <i>you</i> seem to be. I told you I don't like seeing my sisters at each other's <i>throats</i>, remember?</p>


     <p>Daria simply looked at Darren wordlessly. Darren did the same to Daria, and Jane looked between the two, not knowing <i>what</i> to expect next. Daria then responded.</p>


<p>DARIA: Let me get this <i>straight</i>--basically, what you're saying is, I should feel some <i>sympathy</i> for Quinn?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> I wouldn't exactly call it <i>"sympathy"</i>, sis. Let's just call it something similar to what <i>Abraham Lincoln</i> said to the nation in his second Inaugural Address following the Civil War concerning forgiving the former Confederate states, and allowing them back into the Union--<i>"The better angels of our nature". (Narrows his eyes:)</i> You're <i>deeper</i> than Quinn is, more <i>mature</i>. Why bring yourself <i>down</i> to Quinn's level?</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(After a pause, takes in Darren's words, smirks:)</i> Quinn's <i>"level"</i> is about the thickness of a <i>fiberoptic telephone cable</i>, which is pretty <i>thin</i>--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smirks back:)</i> --And <i>you're</i> about as <i>deep</i> as the <i>Mariana Trench</i>. All I ask is that the <i>"secret"</i> is now <i>out</i>--let it <i>go</i>, sis.</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(After a moment, looks between Darren and Jane, shrugs:) Okay</i>, I will. <i>(Jane cocks an eyebrow, surprised by Daria giving in so soon)</i> I'll take <i>solice</i> in the fact that the <i>"secret"</i> is out, and leave it at that.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Relieved, smiles:)</i> Thank you again, sis.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>Allllrighty</i>--we're past the <i>"cousin"</i> thing, but we've <i>still</i> gotta deal with this <i>"date"</i> thing. Why in the <i>hell</i> should I give my <i>approval</i> to you to date Sandi Griffin this Friday night, the <i>same</i> Friday night that Trent and the guys are supposed to play at <I>McGrundy's</I>?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Pauses, takes a deep breath:)</i> You said that Mystik Spiral is going to be at McGrundy's for a <i>week</i>. We can catch them any <i>other</i> day. <i>(Gets up out of the chair, walks to Jane:)</i> Jane, I <i>don't</i> want to do this, <i>please</i> believe me. Previously, I was under the <i>impression</i> that Quinn didn't <i>need</i> to be in the Fashion Club to get into the Fashion Institute, but then I delved <i>further</i> into the <i>updated</i> version of the Fashion Institute's website and found out that participation in a fashion club for at least <i>three</i> years in a high school is a <i>mandatory</i> requirement to get into the Fashion Institute. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Jane, if it were anything <i>else</i>, I'd tell Sandi Griffin to take a <i>flying leap</i>--I can't <i>stand</i> the girl. It's <i>obvious</i> she wants to <i>"show me off"</i>, like some sort of <i>trophy</i>, similar to what Quinn tried to <i>pull off</i> at the Pizza King when she introduced me to her "friends". All I ask is that you <i>allow</i> me to do so just this once--for <i>Quinn</i>.</p> 


     <p>Jane looked up at Darren, and sighed <i>audibly</i>, exasperated. She looked over at Daria, who looked at the two, and spoke.</p>


<p>DARIA: Jane--<i>(pauses:)</i> I think we both can safely say that you can <i>trust</i> my bro--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> --But it's <i>Sandi Griffin</i> that I don't trust. <i>(Hesitates, looks at Darren:)</i> I'm not <i>insecure</i>, like I told you, Darren. It's just that--I--well--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gives a quiet smile, in an assuring tone:)</i> --Okay--in that case, to <i>soothe</i> your misgivings, Jane, I may have a <i>solution</i>--how about if you two <i>follow</i> us on our so-called "date", <i>out-of-sight</i>? You know, to just <i>watch</i> us in case if she <i>"tries"</i> anything--I'll even <i>pay</i> for your expenses. <i>(Pauses:)</i> How about it? My treat.</p>


     <p>Daria and Jane looked at each other, surprised, then back at Darren.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Hell, why <i>not</i>? As long as <i>you're</i> paying, Darren.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(After a moment, looks at Darren a little uneasily:)</i> Um, bro? Are you <i>sure</i> you'll have <i>enough</i> money to take <i>Sandi</i> out <i>and</i> treat us? I feel kind of like a <i>hypocrite</i> after giving Quinn the third degree over trying to take <i>advantage</i> of you, and I wouldn't want you to go <i>broke</i> trying to spread your <i>little</i> bit of money like that.</p>  

<p>DARREN: <i>(Waves Daria off, chuckles:)</i> Nah, it's <i>okay</i>, sis--I can afford it. <i>(Pauses:)</i> To be <i>honest</i> with you, Sandi Griffin makes me feel--<i>(shudders:) uncomfortable</i>. I'd like for you two to be <i>nearby</i> as some sort of <i>"reassurance factor"</i> for me.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Raises eyebrows, surprised:) "Reassurance factor"</i>? <i>We</i> make you feel like <i>that</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(In deadpan tone:)</i> We're losing our <i>effectiveness</i>, Lane--we used to make people feel <i>uncomfortable</i>--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Now in the same tone as Daria:)</i> --Now we're making them feel <i>comfortable</i>, Morgendorffer. This simply <i>cannot</i> be tolerated. <i>(Darren looks between the two and starts to grin, amused)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: Agreed, Lane--any <i>suggestions</i>?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Starts to walk mock-meanacingly towards Darren, smirks:) Leave</i> me with the subject to <i>interrogate</i> him, Morgendorffer.</p> 


     <p>To Daria, she could tell that Jane wanted to spend some time alone with Darren--time to make herself scarce.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Very well, Lane--I shall take my leave in your <i>kitchen</i> to consume liquid nourishment myself via your <i>Kool-Aid</i>. Report any <i>findings</i> to me. <i>(Daria leaves)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Puts her arms around a smirking Darren's neck:)</i> Acknowledged.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Grins, looks down at Jane, holds her waist:)</i> I <i>warn</i> you--I'm a <i>tough nut</i> to crack, Lane.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Wicked smirk:)</i> I just <i>love</i> a <i>challenge</i>, bub. <i>(Both kiss each other)</i></p>


     <p>After the kiss, Darren smiled weakly, then backed away from Jane, sighing, and looking a little unsure. Jane immediately noticed this, arched her eyebrow, smirked, and promptly inquired.</p>


<p>JANE: Hmmm--am I <i>losing</i> my kissing touch? What's up? <i>(Thought v.o.: Are you gonna tell me what's <b>bugging</b> you, Darren?)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(After a moment:)</i> Jane, please don't take this the <i>wrong way</i>, but do you think we're moving--<i>(looks for words:)</i> well, a little too <i>fast</i> in our relationship, here? <i>(Jane looks surprised)</i> Before you say anything, let me explain. I've been thinking that I want to like you for <i>you</i>, and not just to get past <i>Stephanie</i>, here. After all, it has been not quite <i>two</i> months since she died, a period that I <i>admit</i> is a relatively <i>short</i> time to get over what happened. <i>(Pauses, adds:)</i> I--wouldn't want to <i>mislead</i> you. <i>(Thought v.o.: As if I'm not doing it right <b>now</b>. You're a <b>capital</b> rogue, Darren.)</i> I <i>still</i> have <i>some</i> feelings for her--she'll <i>always</i> have a <i>small</i> place in my <i>heart</i>--I--<i>(hesitates:)</i> hope you can <i>understand</i> that.</p> 


     <p>Jane stared up at Darren for a moment, then let out a small, quiet, chuckle, shaking her head slowly. Now it was <i>Darren's</i> turn to look surprised.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:)</i> You know, I had the <i>same</i> sort of a feeling over how I felt about you coming so "soon" after <i>Tom</i>. Though our relationship had gone downhill <i>steadily</i> and we eventually broke up, I <i>still</i> have <i>some</i> feelings for him, too, and like I told you, we're going to <i>stay</i> as friends. As far as I'm concerned, I understand <i>perfectly. (Darren smiles slowly, relieved, then Jane adds reluctantly, looks at him expectantly:)</i> Uh--is that <i>it</i>? <i>(Thought v.o.: Maybe I can get you to <b>open up</b> to me?)</i></p>


     <p>Darren narrowed his eyes down at Jane for a second, and to her for the briefest of instants, it seemed to be a <i>pained</i> look. Darren's visage then quickly changed to an appearance of <i>normalcy</i>, then he gave a quick shrug.</p>


<p>DARREN: Ah--<i>no. You</i> have anything to add?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Thought v.o.: <b>Damn!</b> For a moment there, I thought--)</i> Er, no, not really. <i>(Walks up to Darren, holds his hands)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Okay--I been thinking about something else--do you think we should tell <i>Trent</i> about what I'm going to do Friday night? He's going to wonder about why we're <i>not</i> there.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Ponders:)</i> Um, I think he'll <i>understand</i> that we won't be able to come if we tell him something's come up at the last second. I don't want what we're doing to kind of <i>distract</i> him while he and the guys are playing.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> I can see what you're saying about him possibly being distracted, but are you <i>sure</i> he won't mind?</p> 

<p>JANE: <i>(Waves him off:) Naaaah</i>--Trent can sometimes be <i>out</i> of it at times when he's playing. It's cool--<i>(smirks wickedly, puts her arms around Darren's neck:)</i> now, <i>where</i> were we?</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles, puts his arms around Jane's waist:)</i> I think we were <i>here--(kisses her)</i></p>


     <p>Daria went to the Lane's kitchen, and found the aforementioned Kool Aid (<i>cherry-favored</i>, in case you're wondering) in the refrigerator. She took the pitcher out, and put it on the table. Daria got a glass from the Lane's cabinet, and poured the Kool Aid into the glass. She sat down at the table and was about to drink it, when she saw Trent come into the kitchen, groggily, scratching his head. He saw Daria at the table and smiled.</p>


<p>TRENT: Hey, Daria--where's Janey and Darren?</p>

<p>DARIA: Hey, Trent--they're--<i>talking</i> in her room. I came down here to get me something to drink. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I assume you just rose out of bed?</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Reaches into the cabinet to get some coffee:)</i> Yeah--we had one <i>hell</i> of a practice last night at Max's place. I don't remember when we had a <i>better</i> one than that before--it was really <i>something. (Starts to make the coffee)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(After a moment, hesitates:)</i> Trent, is it <i>me</i>, or do I sense that you and the guys seem to have a <i>new</i> sort of--<i>vitality</i> added on to your music? Darren, Jane and I heard you guys the other day while you practiced here, <i>(Trent cocks an eyebrow at Daria)</i> and it's like, Mystik Spiral's got a new type of <i>purpose</i> to play, or something?</p>


     <p>Trent stared at Daria for a moment, then slowly <i>smiled</i>, sitting at the table across from her. Daria felt that ever-so-tiny <i>"lump"</i> in her chest again--though she <i>knew</i> it was <i>nowhere</i> nearly as strong as it <i>used</i> to be--damn <i>dormant</i> feelings.</p>


<p>TRENT: Huh--you noticed that <i>too</i>, Daria? Janey said sort of the same thing to me a couple of days ago. Yeah, you can say things are a <i>lot</i> better with our music now. Man, I tell you, it's <i>rockin'</i>, Daria. it used to be that we'd play just <i>"to play"</i>, like we were going through the <i>"motions"</i>, or something, even when we were doing well on that tour we took up all the way to what happened in Reidsville. <i>(Pauses:)</i> You know, maybe the <i>best</i> thing that could've happened to us was what happened to the old Tank. <i>(Daria lowers an eyebrow at this)</i> On our way back home riding on the back of that pick-up truck, we were at a point <i>lower</i> than at any time I can remember. That experience kinda <i>humbled</i> us, Daria.</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Quiet, thought v.o.: And playing at those small <b>carnivals</b> while you all were on "tour" <b>didn't</b>?:)</i> Um, I suppose you felt that you guys couldn't get <i>any</i> lower than it was, for it was the <i>"darkest before the dawn"</i>, and then suddenly there came a <i>"light at the end of the tunnel"</i>?</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Lights up:)</i> Yeah, Daria--<i>exactly</i>! Then that <i>"Mysterious Benefactor"</i> came in and <i>saved</i> us! It gave us new <i>life</i> with what he or she did. <i>(Grows quiet:)</i> Now, we can go on and go after that <i>dream</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Gives a small smile:)</i> I'm--<i>happy</i> for you guys, Trent--I <i>really</i> am. You seem to be on your <i>way</i>, now.</p>

<p>TRENT: Yeah, I <i>hope</i> so, Daria--<i>(pauses, looks determined:)</i> but we <i>still</i> gotta work <i>hard</i> to get where we wanna be, and practice more. We even heard some <i>rumors</i> that a record agent might be <i>scoping</i> us out. I dunno if that's true or not, but we're not gonna take <i>any</i> chances on letting up. I'm glad you guys are gonna be coming to McGrundy's this Friday <i>(Daria looks down uncomfortably)</i> --it should be our <i>best</i> performance yet.</p>

<p>DARIA: Um, Trent--I meant to tell you--something <i>just</i> came up. Jane, Darren, and I <i>won't</i> be able to come to McGrundy's this Friday.</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Pauses:) Oh</i>. Something <i>really</i> important?</p>

<p>DARIA: That depends on what you think is considered to <i>be "important"</i>. Let's just say it <i>can't</i> be put off. <i>(Thought v.o.: Though I'd like to put off Quinn and Sandi on a <b>deserted</b> isle and let them fight it out to the <b>death</b>.)</i> Is it okay if we take a <i>rain check</i>? You guys'll be at McGrundy's <i>through</i> next week, and we can come anytime then, right?</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Sure, Daria, no sweat--we can catch you all later. <i>(Gets up to boil the water to make the coffee, turns to Daria, and leans back on the counter, changes the subject:)</i> So, Janey seems pretty happy being with your brother Darren. He's a <i>cool</i> guy.</p>

<p>DARIA: Yeah, Darren's great--<i>(adds:)</i> though at times, he can be a little <i>too</i> nice for his own good--especially when it comes to helping out my sister <i>Quinn</i>. He just gets a damn <i>soft</i> spot for her. <i>(Thought v.o.: Like <b>me</b> for <b>him</b>.)</i></p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Crosses his arms, ponders:)</i> Hmm--well, Daria, I think I'd rather have a brother or sister that's too <i>nice</i> than too <i>mean</i>--he could be kinda trying to <i>make up</i> the time he missed being with you guys all those years by helping out your sister. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Wouldn't you want him to be there for <i>you</i> like he is for your little sister?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(After a moment:)</i> Yeah--Darren told me and Jane kind of the same thing about Quinn before I came down here. <i>(Smiles slightly:)</i> I guess you're right when you say a big brother is <i>suppose</i> to be there for his little sister, Trent--like <i>you're</i> there for <i>Jane</i>?</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Daria, you <i>know</i> Janey means the <i>world</i> to me--I'd do <i>all</i> I could for her, and I know she'd do the <i>same</i> for me.</p>


     <p>At that moment, Jane and Darren walked into the kitchen, and both heard Trent's words. Jane turned a deep shade of red, and smiled sheepishly at her brother, while Darren looked over at Daria and smiled quietly. Jane walked up to Trent, and hugged him.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Hugs Trent:)</i> Damn it, Trent, are you <i>trying</i> to get me to go all <i>sappy</i> here? Where in the hell did all of this <i>"lovey-dovey"</i> crap come from?</p>

<p>TRENT: Daria and I were just rapping, Janey. You know that's how I <i>really</i> feel about you, don't you?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smiles uneasily while uncomfortably glances over at a now-smirking Daria and a now-grinning Darren:)</i> Yeah, yeah, I do, but geez, couldn't you tell me that when <i>no</i> one was around? Now Daria and Darren's gonna give me a <i>rough</i> time over this <i>"sibling-bonding"</i> thing.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Still smirks:)</i> Hey, what <i>kind</i> of friend would I be if I <i>didn't</i> give you a rough time, Jane?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Still grins, comes up beside Daria:)</i> Besides, why would <i>I</i> give you a rough time, Jane? Remember, I have a middle sister that I've just found that I'm awfully <i>proud</i> of. <i>(Daria cuts her eyes up at Darren, and now it's <b>her</b> turn to become red-faced) (Looks down at Daria, voice grows quiet, serious:)</i> I'd do <i>whatever</i> I could for her, too. <i>(Jane and Trent look at each other, then smile at Daria and Darren)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Now even <b>more</b> red-faced, [similar to the way Daria looked in "Ill"] looks up at Darren:)</i> Ah, <i>hell</i>--Darren, uh--we should go back home and see if Quinn is there, you know--? <i>(Suddenly gets up from her chair:)</i> We'll see you later, guys. <i>(Pushes Darren out of the kitchen)</i></p>


     <p>Jane and Trent then looked at each other, smirked, and sat down at the kitchen table.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Snickers, slowly shakes her head:) Poor</i> Daria--she really doesn't know <i>how</i> to handle having a <i>bona-fide</i> bro that's <i>there</i> for her, does she?</p>

<p>TRENT: Nope--but I think she'll <i>eventually</i> figure it out, Janey. <i>(Changes tone and subject:)</i> So, what did you and Darren <i>talk</i> about?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> Huh?</p>

<p>TRENT: Daria said you and Darren were <i>talking</i> in your room while she was down here.</p>


     <p>Jane's eyes got a little wide-eyed at Trent, remembering her little <i>"talk"</i> with Darren after Daria left them in her room. She then spoke.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Gets in a dismissive tone, shrugs:)</i> Oh, uh, we just spoke about some <i>art</i>, that's all.</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Stares at Jane for a moment:) Oh</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Ditto at Trent, leans back in her chair:)</i> Yep, just some art.</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Stares at Jane some more:)</i> You're <i>not</i> gonna <i>tell</i> me what <i>really</i> happened, are you?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks wickedly, gets up:) Nuh-uh</i>--use your <i>imagination</i>, bro. I'm gonna do some painting. <i>(Leaves with a smug look)</i></p>


     <p>Trent watched her leave, shrugged his shoulders, then got up and went to get the now-boiling pot of water to make his coffee.</p>


     <p>Darren and Daria's trip back to the Morgendorrfer home in Darren's car was going quietly. Daria was still gathering in her mind what Darren said to her in the Lane's kitchen--that he would do <i>whatever</i> he could do for her, too--like Trent would for Jane. She smiled to herself over this thought, still gathering in the events of the past month. Being told by her parents that she and Quinn almost had a brother, thinking that he was stillborn. Finding out later that he was still alive, and had now found his birth parents and sisters. A generally nice, and--<i>handsome</i> (Daria blushed at this) brother who told Daria that he was <i>proud</i> of her, the sister who had most of her life been treated as (and she did not mind it being that way) an <i>outcast</i>. A brother who was becoming an <i>important</i> part of her, and her family's lives. <i>Crap--this is becoming <b>unbelievable</b>. Me, Daria Morgendorffer, my wall that I had built up carefully over the years, only taking it down a little for Jane and Trent, have now found myself taking it down a little bit <b>more</b> for my once-thought-of-dead big brother</i>. Daria cut her eyes over at Darren, who was driving, and said nothing, just taking in the <i>new</i> feelings of <i>sibling pride</i>, something she had <i>rarely</i> experienced with Quinn (and Daria <i>knew</i> vice-versa), that threatened to <i>overwhelm</i> Daria. She was shaken out of her thoughts when Darren spoke.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(After a moment:)</i> Ah--Daria, I hope I didn't <i>embarass</i> you in front of Jane and Trent, with that, you know--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Thought v.o., smirks to herself: Too late for that, bro.:)</i> --Naah
--it's no problem. <i>(Looks uneasily at Darren:)</i> I--kinda--<i>didn't</i> mind you--saying, uh--</p>


     <p>During this time, Darren's car turned into the Morgendorffer's driveway, and simultaneously, Quinn and Stacy came out of the house to greet them. Daria gave herself a silent sigh of <i>relief</i>, especially when she noticed Darren seeing the two coming up to the car, and taking his attention off of her. Darren and Daria got out of the car.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(Smiles:) Hiiiii</i>, bro--<i>(gives a quick look at Daria, curt:) Daria</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> And a <i>"howdy-do"</i> to you, too--<i>Quinn</i>.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gives a quick sigh, slightly annoyed with Quinn's greeting to Daria in front of Stacy:) Quinn. (Looks over at Stacy, quick smile and a nod:)</i> Hello, Stacy.</p>

<p>STACY: <i>(Red-faced, looks down, in a quiet tone:)</i> Um--hi, Darren, Daria. <i>(Takes a deep breath, then:)</i> Quinn and I have been talking, and well--I just wanted to <i>apologize</i> to you for the way I acted Monday. <i>(Darren looks a little surprised, Daria simply looks at Stacy expressionessly)</i> I didn't mean to <i>act</i> like that when you said that Jane Lane was your girlfriend. I just hope you can <i>forgive</i> me.</p>


     <p>Darren stared at her for a moment, then walked up to Stacy, and extended his hand, smiling. Stacy looked up at him, and returned the handshake, a slow smile coming on her face.</p>


<p>DARREN: You're <i>forgiven</i>, Stacy. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Look, let's just <i>forget</i> about what happened, okay? I know you're Quinn's friend, and I don't think we'd want to put her in the <i>middle</i> of anything.</p>

<p>STACY: <i>(Grins:)</i> Okay, Darren--I'm just glad we could get past this. Quinn, you're <i>so</i> lucky to have a great <i>(thought v.o.: And a <b>gorgeous</b> hunk of a) cousin</i>! <i>(Quinn looks at Daria and Darren uncomfortably, while Daria gives a small smirk, and Darren simply says nothing)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: This is a <i>touching</i> scene and such, but if you don't mind, Stacy, Darren and I have to talk to my <i>(in a mocking voice:) "cousin"</i> about a private family matter, <i>(raises her eyebrows, her voice in a dismissive tone:)</i> so if you don't <i>mind</i>--?</p>

<p>STACY: <i>(Gets the message in Daria's tone of voice:)</i> Oh, uh, sure. Quinn, I'll talk to you tomorrow about the <i>Fashion Now</i> TV show that's coming up this weekend, okay?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Under her breath:)</i> You <i>hope. (Darren gives her a quick glance, and Quinn gives her a quick frown, while Stacy looks between them, a little confused)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: Okay, Stacy--see you then. 'Bye. <i>(Stacy leaves while stealing one last glance at Darren)</i></p>


     <p>Quinn watched Stacy go down the street, then turned to Daria and Darren, frowning at Daria.</p>


<p>QUINN: Like, what's <i>your</i> problem, Daria? Who are <i>you</i> to get rid of my friend like <i>that</i>? I don't do the same to your art--<i>(looks at Darren, checks herself:)</i> to <i>Jane</i>!</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Arches an eyebrow:)</i> You're <i>kidding</i>, right? Compared to what you <i>usually</i> do to Jane, I thought I was being <i>nice</i> to Stacy, and we <i>all</i> know that's a <i>miracle</i> within <i>itself</i> when it comes to your <i>"friends"</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(In a soothing tone:)</i> Okay, settle down, you two. <i>(Narrows his eyes at Quinn:)</i> Quinn, I have some <i>bad</i> news--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> --He means <i>cataclysmic</i> news for you, <i>"cuz". (Darren gives Daria a pleading, exasperated look)</i> Okay, bro--no more <i>wisecracks. (Thought v.o.: At least not until <b>later</b>, that is--I just can't <b>help</b> myself.)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Frowns, perplexed, suddenly feels on her face:) OH NO</i>! What is it? Is it my <i>rouge</i>? My <i>mascara</i>? My <i>lip gloss</i>? Am I out of <i>fashion</i>? <i>(Narrows her eyes at Darren:)</i> Don't tell me you <i>forgot</i> to tell mom about <i>restoring</i> my dates?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Thought v.o.: Substitute <b>"mind"</b> for the word <b>"fashion"</b>, and you'll be hitting on <b>all</b> cylinders, <b>"cuz"</b>--or in your case, <b>off</b> of all cylinders.)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sighs:)</i> None of the above, sis--let's just talk inside, okay? <i>(Goes into the house with Quinn and Daria)</i></p>


     <p>About 10 minutes later, Quinn sat back <i>slumped</i> against the middle couch in the living room, stunned and speechless. The <i>"ruse"</i> was over--everything concerning the <i>"cousin"</i> thing (Daria <i>and</i> Darren) was finally out, and that was <i>not</i> even the <i>worse</i> of it. Her brother--her <i>brother</i>, had decided to accept Sandi's offer to keep Quinn in the Fashion Club by going out with Sandi on a <i>date</i>, and to top <i>that</i> off, her parents were probably going to <i>ground</i> her for <i>life</i>--and this <i>after</i> possibly administering the punishment Darren had suggested! This was the <i>worse</i> nightmare Quinn had ever experienced--even <i>more</i> than having <i>split ends</i>, and <i>lipstick smudges</i>, except that it was <i>not</i> a nightmare, but <i>real</i>, all <i>too</i> real. Quinn looked sheepishly over at Darren, who was sitting on the left couch, explaining, while Daria sat on the right couch, watching both of them expressionessly with her arms crossed. Darren had just finished up what he was saying when Quinn suddenly <i>glared</i> at Daria, and <i>leapt</i> up.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(Angry, points at Daria:)</i> An' I just bet <i>you're</i> enjoyin' my <i>predictability</i>, aren't ya, Daria? My life is <i>over</i>!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> Quinn, the word is <i>"predicament"</i>, and for some reason, <i>(glances at Darren:)</i> this doesn't seem like it was as much <i>fun</i> as I thought it would be.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Crosses her arms:)</i> Oh, yeah, <i>riiiight</i>! <i>Suuure</i> it isn't fun!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Gets up, gives Quinn a serious look:)</i> Quinn--listen to me just this <i>once</i>, okay? <i>(Quinn puts her hands on her hips, frowns, while Darren gives an inquisitive look at Daria)</i> I seriously <i>wanted</i> to <i>enjoy</i> what would happen to to you, but well--<i>(gives another glance at Darren:)</i> I kind of blame <i>myself</i> a little for what happened to you as well. <i>(Darren smiles quietly while Quinn looks at Daria with her mouth hanging for a moment, then frowns at Daria suspiciously)</i> I should have <i>discouraged</i> you from doing the <i>"cousin"</i> thing when you <i>first</i> started it, but I didn't, though I kind of thought that when I made that <i>announcement</i> in the auditorium after graduating from that "low self-esteem" class that it would do the <i>trick. (Pauses:)</i> It was <i>fun</i> getting <i>money</i> from you to keep the <i>"cousin"</i> thing secret, and I had my share of <i>laughs</i> with Jane, but, now--I thought about it, and maybe it's time we all started to <i>grow up</i> a little, sis. Darren was--<i>(hesitates:) proud</i> to say that I was his sister. <i>(Narrows her eyes:) I'm</i> willing, <i>always</i> have been, to do the same for <i>you</i>. Why can't <i>you</i> do the <i>same</i> now for <i>me</i>?</p>


<p><i>(Note to reader: Daria, of course, <b>did</b> announce in front of the school that Quinn <b>was</b> her sister in the Lawndale High auditorium in the episode "Esteemers"--more than likely, Quinn was probably able to explain it <b>away</b>, save for a few students. Hey, most of them are <b>shallow</b>, remember?)</i></p>


     <p>Quinn stared at Daria for a moment, then looked over at a stoic-looking Darren, who privately was now even <i>more</i> proud of Daria, if that were possible. Quinn sighed, and plopped back down on the couch, looking down, resigned.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(Almost in a whisper, snorts, shrugs:) Yeah</i>, okay--why <i>not</i>? It's not I have much choice <i>now</i>, do I?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deeply frowns now, deadpan:)</i> Don't knock yourself out on <i>my</i> account--I wouldn't want you to go out of your way for <i>me--"cuz". (Darren moans to himself--they're about to go at it again)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Jumps up:) Look</i>, Daria--<i>if</i> I accept what punishment you and Darren have come up with, not to mention if mom and dad go <i>along</i> with it--my classmates aren't gonna look at me the <i>same</i> way again! I <i>lied</i> to them after all this time! <i>(Darren, seeing how Quinn's words have hit home, gives her a quick, pained look)</i> I'll be <i>lucky</i> if they even see me as an <i>outcast</i> like <i>you</i>, Daria! Popularity means <i>everything</i> to me! Don't you all <i>see</i> that?</p>


<p>Quinn suddenly sat down on the couch and started to <i>cry</i>, burying her head in her hands, this time not shedding the <i>crocodile tears</i> of trying to elicit <i>pity</i> she usually reserved for her parents (especially Jake) in order to get something, but <i>real</i> ones.</p>

     <p>Daria looked down at her sister, and for the first time in a long while, felt genuinely <i>sorry</i> for her. She could not remember the last time she saw Quinn cry, save for a moment when Daria took Quinn's (actually her) toy bear away from Quinn when Daria was eight, and Quinn was six-and-a-half. Of course, this was a rather <i>awkward</i> situation that now had developed, and Daria was rather ill-equipped to deal with the sight before her, having put as as many emotions behind her <i>"wall"</i> as much as possible. She was mulling over what to do when <i>Darren</i> had gotten up and walked past her, and sat down beside Quinn, who buried her face in his shoulder, hugging him. Darren consoled her, hugging her back. Daria shrugged, went and sat down on the far end of the same couch, watching them.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(In a gentle tone:) Shhh</i>--it's okay, Quinn--it'll be all right. You'll get by this in <i>no</i> time.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(While sniffling:) R-really</i>, Darren?</p>

<p>DARREN: Yes, sis--if they're your <i>true</i> friends, <i>(Daria rolls her eyes at this)</i> they'll <i>forgive</i> you. <i>(Thought v.o.: Just as if you guys are my <b>loving</b> birth family, you'll forgive me for <b>my</b> lie--I <b>hope</b>.)</i> Besides, Sandi <i>did</i> agree to <i>keep</i> you in the Fashion Club if I went out with her, remember?</p>


     <p>Quinn <i>frowned</i> at those words, and gently pulled away from Darren, getting up.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(Sounding a little angry:) Yeah</i>, I <i>remember</i>, bro--how can she <i>do</i> that? Doesn't she know that you're seein' <i>Jane</i>? <i>(Daria cocks an eyebrow, slightly surprised)</i> I mean, yeah, you guys said that Jane was <i>willin'</i> to let you do it, but still, I can't believe Sandi would actually go <i>through</i> with it!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks, thought v.o., <b>I</b> can.:)</i> Who says that Sandi's gonna <i>be</i> alone with our bro, sis? Jane and I are going to <i>follow</i> him and Sandi at a <i>distance</i> to make sure your <i>"president"</i> doesn't try and put the <i>"moves"</i> on him.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Wide-eyed, mouth agape:)</i> You and Jane are gonna <i>follow</i> them? <i>(Smirks:)</i> Hmmm--yeah, that'll serve Sandi <i>right--buuut--</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> --But <i>what</i>, Quinn?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Frowns, considers:)</i> Maybe--maybe I can <i>convince</i> her to <i>not</i> do this, you know? I could ask her for some sort of fashion <i>sabbatical</i> punishment, or something--?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sighs:)</i> I don't know, sis--she seemed to be <i>very</i> determined to do this. <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> You know her <i>better</i> than we do--do you <i>really</i> think she would simply just <i>allow</i> a change in punishment?</p>


     <p>Quinn thought hard about Darren's question for a second, then slowly shook her head, looking down.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>No</i>. Sandi <i>won't</i> change her mind--though when I think about it, I wouldn't be surprised if she gave me the fashion sabbatical in <i>addition</i> to goin' out with you--you know, to just keep up our <i>rules. (Pauses, looks around, tries to get out the words:)</i> Maybe--maybe--I--should--should--well--um--<i>leave</i> the Fashion Club so you won't haveta go? <i>(Darren, and especially Daria, look shocked)</i> I know you're doin' this for <i>me</i>, bro--an' I wanna <i>thank</i> you for puttin' yourself on the <i>line</i> like that. <i>(Suddenly pulls up Darren form his sitting position and hugs him:)</i> You don't have to do this, bro--you've done <i>more</i> than enough, with helpin' me out an' stuff.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Thought v.o.: That's <b>it</b>--this <b>can't</b> be my <b>reality</b>. I'm having a actual talk-to-talk with Quinn, and Quinn wants to <b>leave</b> the Fashion Club to keep our bro from going out with Sandi? What's next, <b>Kevin</b> becoming a <b>"brain"</b>? If <b>that</b> happens, I'll <b>strip buck naked</b> for <b>Upchuck</b>, I <b>swear</b> I will.)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Holds her at length, looks down at her, narrows his eyes:) Hold on</i>, sis--let me ask you a <i>direct</i> question, okay? <i>(Quinn nods)</i> Do you <i>want</i> to go to the Fashion Institute?</p>

<p>QUINN: O-of <i>course</i>, but--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Cuts her off softly:)</i> --Good, I didn't think you were going to <i>quit</i> on me, sis. <i>(Pauses:)</i> What good is it to do what you and I did in trying to prepare you for the Fashion Institute, and have it all go to <i>waste</i>?  Don't worry about <i>me</i>, Quinn--I'll be <i>fine</i>. Daria and Jane will be there--worry about what Helen and Jake will <i>do</i> when they come home from work.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Snorts, rolls her eyes:)</i> Yeah, all I have to worry about is <i>that</i> now. <i>(Sighs:)</i> Well, Darren, if <i>that's</i> what you want to <i>do</i>--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smirks with Daria:) --No</i>, I <i>don't</i>, but I'll <i>survive</i>.</p> 

<p>DARIA: And don't forget, <i>"sis"--we'll</i> suggest your punishment to mom and dad, so things might not be <i>that</i> bad.</p> 

<p>QUINN: <i>(Smirks:) Hmmph</i>--should I kinda <i>worry</i> about the way you <i>put</i> that, Daria?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks back:)</i> You know, I think I'm gonna let you <i>wonder</i>, Quinn. <i>(Darren looks between the two and chuckles to himself)</i> And on <i>that</i> note, I'm gonna go to my room and finish some reading and writing. <i>(Leaves to go upstairs)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: I've got a--call to make, bro, 'cuse me. <i>(Leaves as well)</i></p>


     <p>Darren watched Quinn go into the kitchen, and then sat down to watch some TV in the living room.</p>

     <p>Quinn picked up the cell phone on the kitchen table, and went upstairs to her room. Before she started to walk in, however, she looked around, then went in. She sighed, <i>dreading</i> what she was about to do next, then punched some numbers. The phone rang for a few times, then it was answered.</p>


<p>VOICE: <i>(Sounding drowsy:)</i> Hello?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Hesitant:)</i> Um, <i>Trent</i>? This is Quinn.</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Now a sounding like a sneer:)</i> Oh, yeah--<i>"Daria's Sister".</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Annoyed, having heard this before:)</i> I <i>just</i> told you--my name is <i>Quinn. (Pauses:) Look</i>--can I talk to <i>Jane</i>, please?</p>

<p>TRENT: Huh--sure--just a minute.</p>


     <p>A minute later, Jane's voice was on the other end of the phone.</p>


<p>JANE: Yo--<i>Quinn</i>? What's <i>wrong</i>? <i>(Sounding a bit concerned:)</i> Did something happen to Daria or Darren?</p>

<p>QUINN: Uh, no--look, I'm gonna ask you if you can give me your <i>word</i> that what I'm about to say <i>won't</i> reach Daria, Darren, or anyone else--<i>(adds as an afterthought:)</i> includin' your <i>brother</i>, okay?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(In a questioning tone:) Word</i>? Word about <i>what</i>?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Irritated, smacks her mouth in a disgusted way:)</i> Jane, would you just gimme your <i>word</i> that you won't say <i>anything</i> to anyone what I'm about to say to <i>you</i>?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Now in a slightly amused tone:) Hmmm</i>--you and me <i>sharing a secret</i>--I gotta admit, I'm awfully <i>curious</i> to know what you want to tell me--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Hopeful:)</i> --Then I <i>do</i> have your word you won't say anything to them?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Snickering sound:)</i> Ah, hell--<i>why not</i>? Okay, I'll give you my word. So, lemme have it.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(After taking a deep breath, closes her eyes:) Ijustwantedtothankyouforlettin'mybrogooutwithSandiFridaynighttokeepmeintheFashionClub!</i> There! I <i>said</i> it, an' I got your <i>word</i> you <i>won't</i> say anything! <i>'Byeee</i>! <i>(Hangs up)</i></p>


<p><i>(Scene changes to the Lane's, Jane's room)</i></p>


     <p>Jane looked at the phone with a slightly perplexed frown on her face for the briefest of moments. She caught very <i>little</i> of what Quinn had said, but it was <i>just</i> enough for her to put together. Jane then gave a <i>slow</i> smirk of <i>realization</i> to herself, and feeling a little <i>grateful</i>, as well as <i>stunned</i> by what the <i>diva</i> sister of her best friend and boyfriend just did. She clicked off the phone and started to paint some more at her easel just as Trent walked by the open door to her room.</p>


<p>TRENT: <i>(Smirks:)</i> What did <i>"Daria's Sister"</i> want, Janey?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks back:)</i> Oh, to just talk about <i>art</i>, Trent.</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Cocks eyebrow:) Art</i>? <i>(Pauses, realizes:)</i> You're not gonna tell me anything about <i>that</i> either, huh?</p>

<p>JANE: You're batting a <i>thousand</i> today, bro. <i>(Grins)</i></p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Shrugs, gives a lopsided smile, knows when he's beaten:) Whatever</i>. I'm gonna go over to Nick's and practice with the guys. <i>(Leaves)</i></p>


     <p>Down the street from the Morgendorffer's, about several houses down, the gray-colored Camry that had followed Darren's car to and from Helen's job, the restaurant where Darren and Helen ate, to the Lane's, and then back to the Morgendorffer's, was parked. The driver, a muscular, bald, African-American man wearing dark black sunglasses, and a diamond-studded earring, was looking down at his notepad, writing something. He looked up and around, stared at the Morgendorffer's home for a moment, looked back down to his pad, and then kept writing.</p>


<p><i>(Scene fast forwards to the Morgendorffer's, a few hours later)</i></p>


     <p>Helen stood in the middle of the living room, pacing back and forth, with a <i>stern</i> look on her face, cutting her eyes over at Quinn. Jake, who had been told of what Quinn had done while at the office from a call by Helen, also had a stern look (out of <i>backing up</i> Helen, of course), doing the same. He was sitting on the left couch, while Daria and Darren were sitting on the right couch. Quinn was sitting on the center couch, alone, akin to a <i>defendant</i> in a trial, and she had an <i>uneasy</i> look on her face. Helen and Jake found themselves somewhat <i>surprised</i> when Darren and Daria had interceded on Quinn's <i>behalf</i>, and had requested the punishment. Helen, after <i>"consultation"</i> with Jake, decided to <i>accept</i> the punishment, (thanks to <i>Darren's</i> primary influence) and allowed <i>Quinn</i> to decide which punishment to accept. Quinn decided to take the <i>announcement</i>, seeing as it would keep her from spending any of her money to print the fliers. Daria said that she would talk to <i>Ms. Li</i> and arrange the announcement on the first day of school, getting the matter out of the way as soon as possble, so it would not "interfere" with the rest of the school year for Quinn (who, if you will remember, had promised her brother she'd begin to crack down on her books).</p> 
     
     <p>The decision now was what <i>additional</i> punishment Helen and Jake would administer on Quinn that was <i>separate</i> from the school-related punishment. Helen motioned to Jake, and he got up, with both going over to the side of the living room, to <i>"consult"</i> with each other again. Quinn narrowed her eyes at her parents, leaning forward, trying to figure out what they were saying, while Daria leaned over to Darren, and spoke, whispering.</p> 


<p>DARIA: I'm thinking it's gonna be <i>fashion-related</i>, bro.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Whispers back:)</i> No, I think it'll be <i>date-related</i>, sis.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks, sees Helen and Jake break their little conversation up:)</i> Guess we're gonna find out, bro.</p> 


     <p>Helen went back in the middle of the living room, standing and looking at Quinn, narrowing her eyes, while Jake sat back down on the couch, and resumed (or tried to) his stern stare, crossing his arms. Quinn glanced at both, unsure, while Daria and Darren listened intently as Helen spoke.</p>


<p>HELEN: <i>(In a firm voice:)</i> Quinn, your father and I have decided to punish you additionally by not allowing <i>any</i> purchases of clothing for the next month. <i>(Quinn looks devastated, her mouth agape, while Daria smirks secretly at Darren, who shrugs) Also</i>, you'll not date <i>any</i> boys for the <i>same</i> period of time, and you'll be on an <i>8:00 p.m. curfew</i> for this time as well. <i>(Darren gives a smirk right back at Daria, who actually looks surprised at the additional punishments, while Quinn's eyes get <b>huge</b>, as huge as Daria has ever seen them, and Quinn jumps up, angry)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: How could you <i>do</i> this to me, Mom!? Wasn't tellin' everyone this fall that Daria's my <i>sister</i> and takin' my fashions away <i>enough</i>? I <i>need</i> fashion <i>and</i> guys to be <i>popular</i>! Without me keeping in <i>practice</i>, I can't <i>do</i> that! <i>(Outstretches her arms:) They</i> both <i>need</i> me!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan, low tone to Darren out of the side of her mouth:)</i> What will they do, what <i>will</i> they do? <i>(Darren tries not to laugh, looks at Daria)</i></p>


<p><i>(Note to reader: Daria's little quip [said once before by her in this fic] comes from old commercials done by pitchman Karl Malden for <b>American Express</b> traveler's checks--<b>"Don't leave home without them"</b>! Do <b>you</b> remember?)</i></p>


<p>HELEN: Then you should have <i>thought</i> of that <i>before</i> you did that <i>"cousin"</i> thing to your sister! Quinn, you have to learn the <i>consequences</i> of your actions! Right, Jake?</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Jumps up, points to Quinn:)</i> That's <i>right</i>, honey! Quinn, listen to your mother!</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Grabs her hair, starts to sob:) ARRRGH</i>! <i>(Suddenly turns around and while running up the stairs:)</i> I'm <i>never</i> coming out of my room <i>again</i>! My life's <i>over</i>! <i>(Darren, concerned, looks as if he is going to go after her, but Daria gently grabs his arm, and a second later, a door is heard slamming upstairs)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shakes her head:)</i> Let her go, bro--she'll come <i>out</i> of it--remember what happened after you said she was your cousin to the Fashion Club? She came around <i>then</i>, and she'll come around over this, eventually. <i>(Thought v.o.: And she'll probably also come around with some sort of <b>plan</b> to <b>con</b> mom and dad to cut down on her punishments)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Still looks after Quinn:)</i> I--suppose you're <i>right</i>, Daria.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Sighs, sits down where Quinn sat:)</i> I hope we did the <i>right</i> thing.</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Gets up and sits beside Helen, squeezes her shoulder:) Sure</i> we did, Helen! Our sweetie will <i>learn</i> from this ol' <i>bump-in-the-road</i>, and will come out on <i>smooth</i> asphalt! <i>(Begins to look in space, gets angry, narrows eyes:)</i> Unlike <i>me</i> when it came to my <i>Old Man</i>! <i>(Daria and Darren look at each other uneasily) My</i> road was <i>never</i> smooth with <i>him</i>! It was always a damn <i>crater</i>, twenty-four hours a day, with <i>no</i> let-up! Why, there was one time when I--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Glares:)</i> --Jake, <i>please</i>!</p> 

<p>JAKE: <i>(Suddenly smiles:)</i> I'm <i>okay</i>, Helen! <i>(Looks over at Darren with that idiotic grin:) Right</i>, Big Guy? <i>(Gives that "thumb's-up" sign)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Responds uncomfortably while Daria smirks at him:)</i> Uh, <i>right. (Thought v.o.: I don't think I'll <b>ever</b> get used to that.)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the office of Leonard Potter, Los Angeles, the same time)</i></p>



     <p>Leonard Potter sat at his desk, deep in thought. The past few days had been nothing short of a complete <i>shock</i> to him--like touching a <i>live</i> wire off of one of those <i>high voltage power lines</i>. He had been convinced that William would not <i>dare</i> do something as <i>brazen</i> as transfer Constance Waters, but William <i>showed</i> him--and everyone <i>else</i>. Within the company, <i>questions</i> were being bandied about, but Leonard <i>knew</i> in his heart the <i>real</i> reason--that William somehow or another had <i>pressured</i> Constance into heading up Appleton's stake in Tsumana/Fuju--he was <i>sure</i> of it, though he could not <i>prove</i> it. Leonard had tried to <i>call</i> Constance, but had found out that she was <i>gone</i> already--more than likely <i>rushed</i> off to Japan by William, so she wouldn't be able to <i>answer</i> any lingering questions. Maybe after she had settled in Tokyo, he would call her and see what she <i>really</i> knew about what William did. Leonard sighed to himself--Arthur Sr. would have <i>never</i> done that to her, more than likely probably <i>promoting</i> her on the spot for getting a significant share in Tsunama/Fuju.</p>

     <p>He frowned to himself, perplexed--would <i>Darren</i> had done that if <i>he</i> were involved in the company right now? Leonard had wondered occasionally about the heir to the Appleton fortune, having heard from <i>Millie</i> when she had called Leonard a few days ago that things were going <i>well</i> for Darren while he was staying with his birth family for the summer. <i>Good</i>--that young man had been through <i>enough</i> hell these past few weeks, and it was about <i>time</i> he had something <i>good</i> happen to him.</p> 

     <p>Of course, Leonard <i>knew</i> that Darren would <i>not</i> take over the Appleton conglomerate following the deaths of his parents. Arthur and Lucille <i>themselves</i> had <i>told</i> Leonard as much. Leonard remembered them both telling him once that Darren would not be ready for a few <i>years</i>, at least until he had gotten out of Eastward, and probably going to a business-only school, then getting experience by <i>observing</i> and <i>learning</i> the inner workings of Appleton's business. Arthur and Lucille were <i>terrified</i> of <i>"The Secret"</i> getting out before Darren had turned twenty-two, and they decided to <i>rewrite</i> the will beforehand, actually having taken it <i>away</i> from <i>William</i>, whom they were <i>originally</i> going to give primary control to, because of his strange <i>"attitude"</i> change following the meeting in the Florida Keys--<i>what</i> in the world happened there that caused William to <i>change</i> like that? Still, after the deaths of Darren's parents, it turned out to seemingly be a <i>wise</i> choice, Darren's choosing of <i>William</i> as Appleton Industries' new Chairman (personal bias aside)--or so he <i>thought</i>. Now, after all that had happened in almost the past month, he <i>wasn't</i> so sure anymore. He had experienced the <i>"wrath"</i> of William's newfounded power, and he found himself <i>not</i> liking it <i>one</i> bit--and he felt the <i>same</i> thing from the private <i>rumblings</i> of some other business people at Appleton Industries, too.</p>

     <p>He then thought about the detective <i>Gerald Woo</i>. Obviously, Woo <i>suspected</i> William of <i>some</i> sort of <i>wrongdoing</i>, what, with all of those <i>questions</i> Woo asked Leonard when Woo visited his office--but <i>what</i>? <i>Who</i> was Woo's <i>client</i>? Could it be someone Leonard <i>knew</i>? Perhaps he should <i>call</i> Woo to <i>inquire</i>, or maybe offer to <i>volunteer</i> whatever assistance he could to Woo if Woo asked any <i>further</i> questions <i>about</i> William? It certainly couldn't hurt to <i>ask</i> Woo--he had <i>little</i> to <i>no</i> work to do here, anyway. He turned on his intercom button.</p>


<p>LEONARD: <i>Hannah</i>, could you find the number of the detective Gerald Woo, so I can call him, please?</p>

<p>HANNAH: Yessir, Mr. Potter. <i>(Reaches for the company's phone directory)</i></p>


<p><i>(Scene changes to the Woo Detective Agency, a few minutes later)</i></p>


     <p>Carla was typing on the computer keyboard at her desk when her phone rang. In one motion, she answered it while still typing.</p>


<p>CARLA: Woo Detective Agency, may I help you?</p>

<p>VOICE: Yes--is Gerald Woo there? This is Leonard Potter, legal counsel for Appleton Industries, West coast division, and I wished to talk to him about a
--<i>private</i> matter.</p>

<p>CARLA: I'm sorry, but he's out for the moment, Mr. Potter--I could try and <i>page</i> him for you--</p>

<p>LEONARD: <i>(After a moment:)</i> --No, no--that's all right--I'll try again later. Please tell him I called, thank you.</p>

<p>CARLA: <i>(Stops her typing long enough to write down Leonard's name:)</i> All right, I will. Goodbye, Mr. Potter. <i>(Hangs up, resumes typing)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to Appleton Towers, New York City, William Appleton's office, the same time)</i></p>



     <p>William Appleton was sitting at his desk with Benny standing at his side, while a nervous-looking Sam Norwood stood before them, looking in some files.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Scowls:)</i> All right, Sam--tell me I can legally <i>take</i> Appleton away from my <i>"nephew"</i>.</p>

<p>NORWOOD: <i>(Looks up from his file with an <b>ashen</b> look on his face, sweats:)</i> B-Boss, I-I-I'm s-s-sorry, but I <i>tried</i>, I r-r-<i>really</i> tried, I <i>did</i>, b-but P-P-Potter--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Cuts him off:) --Damn</i> it, man--just <i>spit</i> it out! <i>Can</i> I get Appleton?!</p>

<p>NORWOOD: <i>(Looks down:) No</i>, sir--it's <i>airtight</i>. P-Potter covered <i>e-e-every</i> legal base--Darren Appleton is the <i>sole</i> heir over Appleton Industries. <i>(Adds quietly:)</i> I did my <i>best</i>, sir. <i>(Cowers, while Benny cuts his eyes warily at William)</i></p>


     <p>William's visage, to the surprise of Benny and Norwood, became <i>expressionless</i>, as if <i>resigned</i>. He slowly got up, and walked around the desk, whereas Norwood suddenly became <i>wide-eyed</i> and <i>terrified</i>. His body became <i>rigid</i> when William walked towards, and then at the last second, <i>past</i> him. Norwood took a deep breath and <i>relaxed</i> when William went to one side of the office and stared at the wall for a long moment, with his hands in his dress pants pockets. Both men stared at each other, confused. In a way, to both of them, it seemed it would have been <i>better</i> for them if their "Boss" had gone into a <i>rage</i>, having been used to seeing it <i>many</i> times. Instead, they were greeted with a <i>quiet</i> response--it seemed--<i>frightening</i> to both men in a way. William then turned around, looking pointedly at a <i>again-afraid</i> Norwood with the same expressioness look, then spoke.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: <i>(In an eerily calm tone:)</i> Very well, Sam--you did your <i>level</i> best. <i>(Norwood looks at him, shocked:)</i> In a way, I should have <i>expected</i> Potter to do such a <i>thorough</i> job. Arthur Sr. always said he was the <i>best</i> at what he did
--<i>(quietly chuckles:)</i> and who am <i>I</i> to argue?</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Carefully gets out his next words, looks at Norwood uneasily, and vice-versa:)</i> Uh, Boss--are you <i>okay</i>? We thought, well--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(In the same tone, cuts him off:)</i> --I'm fine, Benny--just fine.
<i>Reality</i>, you see, has just hit me in the <i>face. (Both men look at him like he's lost his mind:)</i> Don't you two <i>morons</i> know what this <i>means</i>?</p>

<p>NORWOOD: Uh, nooo--Boss--what <i>does</i> it mean?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Now shows a dark look:)</i> It means <i>we</i> deal <i>directly</i> with my <i>"nephew"</i> right after Sanchez--I'll get to that in a minute. <i>(Frowns:)</i> Speaking or which, what-in-the-damn-hell is taking Sanchez so <i>long</i> to call, Benny?</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Shrugs, sighs, exasperated:)</i> Beats me, Boss, we--</p>


     <p>The intercom on William's desk suddenly beeped. William walked over and pushed the receiver button.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: Yes, Lilly--what is it?</p>

<p>LILLY: A call for <i>Mr. Lodell</i>, sir.</p>

<p>BENNY: Thank you, Lilly. <i>(Goes over to the desk, picks up the phone:)</i> Yes?</p>


     <p>William walked back in the middle of the room with Norwood, waiting, while Benny talked.</p>


<p>BENNY: And you're <i>sure</i> about that? <i>(Pauses:)</i> Good work--return to your post.
<i>(Hangs up:)</i> That was our man spying on Woo--guess <i>who</i> just called him?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Frowns:)</i> I don't have <i>time</i> for guessing games, Benny. Who was it?</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>Leonard Potter</i>--he wanted to speak to Woo, but he wasn't there at the moment.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> Oh? So now <i>Potter's</i> asking <i>questions</i>, is he? <i>(Pauses:)</i> I'm beginning to <i>wonder</i>--is he working <i>with</i> Darren? <i>(Narrows his eyes at Benny, realizes:) Wait</i> a minute--<i>where</i> was Woo?</p> 

<p>BENNY: Our man said that he went to get a late <i>lunch</i>, and--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Now furious:) YOU IDIOT! (Benny cowers:)</i> I wanted to keep an eye on Woo at <i>all</i> times! He could be </i>paged</i> by one of his men while out eating, that Sanchez has been <i>located</i>, and we might <i>never</i> know!</p> 

<p>BENNY: <i>(Tries to understand:)</i> B-but Boss--you said--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Goes up to Benny's face, grabs his coat collar:)</i> --I SAID, TO KEEP AN <b>EYE</b> ON WOO! THAT MEANT AT <b>ALL</b> TIMES, NOT JUST DURING THE DAY!</p> 

<p>BENNY: <i>(Completely sputters:)</i> O-oh, <i>t-that's</i> what you meant. I-I'll get <i>another</i> man to help out the one already there, Boss.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Snatches his hands off of Benny, still frowns:) Do</i> that, you fool--you're <i>lucky</i> that our man has said that they haven't found Sanchez yet! <i>(Goes back to his desk, sits down:)</i> Sam, I want you to draw up some <i>new</i> legal papers--I'm formulating a plan in my mind now on how to get Appleton Industries from my <i>"nephew"</i>, and I'll need the legal paperwork from you to make that happen--by the time everything's over and done, Darren will have <i>willingly</i> given everything to me <i>legally. (Benny and Norwood look at each other)</i></p> 

<p>BENNY: <i>"Paperwork"</i>? Your "nephew" <i>willingly</i> giving you the whole conglomerate? Boss--<i>(pauses:)</i> what's going on? I thought you'd want to <i>kill</i> Darren after we've dealt with Sanchez, and leave it at that.</p> 

<p>WILLIAM: And kill him we <i>shall</i>, Benny--but it's going to involve <i>"persuading"</i> him to see things my way, and the way I do that is to <i>"secure"</i> the dear boy's <i>birth family. (Frowns:)</i> Why do you think I have our man <i>scoping</i> out all of this <i>"Lawndale"</i>? Gathering <i>information</i> on Darren's birth family and their friends? Their <i>habits</i> at work and at home? I want to make sure that my <i>"nephew"</i> sees that I hold <i>all</i> of the cards here, and that he'll have <i>no</i> choice, other than to <i>sign</i> the papers that Sam here will draw up that will have Darren hand over <i>complete</i> power to me. I simply can't <i>trust</i> the Board to vote me in power by a majority to replace Darren after he <i>dies</i>--I need what I call <i>"assurance insurance".</i></p>

<p>NORWOOD: But <i>how</i> will you do that, Boss?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Scowls, looks up:)</i> Lord, <i>help</i> this man--<i>(looks directly at Norwood, talks to him like an adult speaks to a child:) didn't-I-just-say-that-we-want-to-<b>secure</b>-Darren's-birth-family? (Norwood gets an "Ohhhh" look on his face)</i> That means we <i>kidnap</i> them, and <i>force</i> Darren to sign the papers, then we'll <i>kill</i> him. As for his <i>birth family</i>--weeell--I haven't decided on <i>what</i> to do with them yet--depends on if I'm in a <i>"good"</i> mood at the time if my <i>"nephew"</i> cooperates fully. <i>(Changes tone:)</i> Now, gentleman, you have your assignments--hop to it. <i>(Benny and Norwood immediately leave)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the Morgendorffer's, a few hours later)</i></p>


     <p>Helen, Jake, and Daria were sitting around the kitchen table finishing eating, while Darren was gathering up the dishes, and putting them in the dishwasher. (Quinn had <i>refused</i> to come out of her room to join the others, still pouting over her punishments, and a portion was sat aside for her to eat for later.) An offer went out to <i>Jane</i>, but she was helping Trent and Mystik Spiral out on a painting a <i>poster</i> of them that they had asked her to do to help the "promotion" of their "comeback" tour, so she respectfully declined, also adding that Darren should spend some "quality" time with his birth family, and that they'd <I>"make up"</I> for it later, with a <i>sinister</i> grin. Helen and Jake had offered to help clean up, but Darren had said no, insisting that <i>he</i> clean up--he figured he owed them at least <i>that</i> much for their hospitality while he had stayed here, not to mention the fact that he also had <i>prepared</i> the meal, volunteering to do so, much to the surprise of the others. Jake, who primarily did the cooking in the Morgendorffer household, was <i>estatic</i>, and had tried to <i>help</i> out in the kitchen, but was <i>shooed</i> out by Helen after Darren had quietly asked her to do so, saying that he wanted to <i>"surprise"</i> them with the dish. After scavenging around in the kitchen, and a quick trip to the grocery store, Darren came up with the dish he was looking for--a <i>sausage and rice casserole</i>. Daria, ever the <i>cynic</i>, had privately found herself wondering if Darren <i>knew</i> what he was doing, putting himself on the <i>line</i> like that, suspecting that the <i>real</i> reason he was doing this was to get <i>out</i> of having lasagna <i>again</i>--not that she could <i>blame</i> him. (She was <i>partially</i> right after asking him out of the hearing range of the others, but he assured her he <i>could</i> cook the dish.)</p> 

     <p>After eating their portions, Darren, who had finished putting all of the dirty dishes into the dishwasher, decided to ask for their opinions, wanting complete <i>honesty</i>. Inwardly, he felt a bit of <i>nervousness</i>--would they <i>like</i> what he had prepared? Jake <i>jumped</i> in first.</p>


<p>JAKE: <i>(Grins, leans back in his chair and pats his stomach:)</i> Darren, that was a <i>great</i> meal! <i>Where'd</i> you get the recipe?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Thought v.o.: From <b>Henri</b>, the chef at the mansion, but you'll know that soon enough.:)</i> From--a <i>cookbook</i>, and--<i>experimenting</i> at home, and in home ec.</p>

<p>HELEN: Oh, Darren, that was a <i>superb</i> dish! <i>(Thought v.o.: Jake can take a few <b>lessons</b> from him.)</i> Daria, what did <i>you</i> think?</p>


     <p>Daria looked between the three for a long moment, then spoke.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> It didn't <i>kill</i> me, and it <i>was</i> tasty--so, I suppose it was <i>okay. (Thought v.o.: Let's see now--you're an almost-too perfect nice brother, martial-arts expert, an art critic, and now a good cook who by sheer coincidence might've known these "Appleton" people who died in that jet plane crash--what <b>other</b> secrets are you <b>hiding</b>, bro?)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Glares at her for a moment, sighs loudly:)</i> Why am I <i>not</i> surprised by your reaction, Daria? I think--</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Inquisitive look, cuts in:)</i> --Just <i>"okay"</i>, Kiddo? Your 'Ol Dad likes to think of himself as a <i>connoisseur</i> of fine cooking, <i>(Helen rolls her eyes, while Daria simply stares at him, and Darren gives a little smile)</i> and I gotta say I <i>loved</i> the taste!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(More deadpan:)</i> How's this, then--<i>wowee, whoopee, way-to-go, bro? Your dish <b>awoke</b> the taste buds in my mouth, filling it with culinary delight, the likes which I can only experience once in a <b>blue</b> moon? (Pauses:)</i> Now, can <i>that</i> be considered <i>beyond</i> "okay", Dad? <i>(Helen frowns at Daria, while Jake tries to understand what she's said)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Laughs at Daria's remark:)</i> Thanks, all of you--I appreciate your comments. I just thought you'd all would like to have something--<i>different</i> for a change of pace. <i>(Thought v.o.: And <b>anything</b>, and I <b>do</b> mean anything, would've been better than <b>more</b> lasagna.)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Gets up and hugs Darren:)</i> It was <i>different</i>, son--and <i>delicious</i>. Thank you <i>so</i> much for fixing this. <i>(Pauses, sighs:)</i> I only wished <i>Quinn</i> could've eaten with us instead of staying upstairs in her bedroom, <i>angry</i> at us.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:) Forget</i> it, Mom--we might not even <i>see</i> Quinn until the next <i>"Ice Age"</i>--or fashion <i>evolution</i>, whichever comes the hell first. <i>(Drinks some water)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Frowns for a second:)</i> Now, Daria--Quinn will <i>have</i> to come out of her room soon--</p> 

<p>JAKE: <i>(Cuts Helen off:)</i> --Yeah, Kiddo! She's gotta <i>eat</i>, and use the--<i>(motions his head up, uncomfortable:)</i> you know--<i>"potty-room". (Darren shakes his head slowly, chuckles to himself, while Helen rolls her eyes)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Gets up:)</i> Gee, I'll mark down <i>that</i> rather <i>historical</i> moment when it occurs, Dad. I'm going up to my room.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Puts the leftover on a tray, gets up as well:)</i> Daria, on your way there, could you please <i>drop</i> this off to <i>Quinn</i>? I'm sure she's <i>hungary</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Caught off-guard:)</i> Uh--Mom--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Steps in:) --I</i> can--<i>(stops as he sees Helen give him a <b>sharp</b> look:)</i> ah, I'll finish cleaning up down here. <i>(Turns quickly around, starts to faux-wipe the kitchen counter with a paper towel he sees on the side)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Jumps up, eager:)</i> Hey, honey, <i>I</i> don't mind--<i>(sees the same look as Darren did, turns immediately into the living room:)</i> eh, that's <i>right</i>! There's another baseball game on the <i>"Prosports" Channel</i>! Hey, Big Guy, when you finish cleaning up, you wanna <i>join</i> me to watch it on the ol' "telly"?</p>


     <p>Darren glanced at Jake for a moment, then looked between the stoic-looking Daria, and the determined-looking Helen. Though he certainly had not been around long enough to <i>know</i> his birth mother, it was <i>clear</i> to him that she seemed to want to talk to Daria about Quinn. Best to let them converse.</p>


<p>DARREN: Oh, yeah--sure. <i>(Looks around the kitchen:)</i> As a matter of fact, I've basically finished in here anyway, <i>(laughs uneasily:)</i> with the, ah, <i>dishwasher</i> doing the work and all, so I'll come with you right now. <i>(Leaves with Jake into the living room)</i></p>


     <p>Daria watched Jake and Darren go into the living room, and turned to her mother, her eyebrow cocked.</p>


<p>DARIA: Okay, Mom--Darren and dad have now <i>abandoned</i> the kitchen premises. I'm guessing that you wish for me to take that leftover dish up to Quinn so I can talk to her and bring her out of her self-imposed <i>"funk"</i>, am I right?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(After a moment:)</i> You're <i>partially</i> right, Daria--I just don't want Quinn to hold her punishment against <i>you</i> in particular for no <i>real</i> reason, maybe for a <i>long</i> while, and risk letting her anger <i>fester</i>. I'd talk to her <i>myself</i>, but--</p>

<p>DARIA: --She's still <i>PO'd</i> at you, and dad, well--<i>(trails off)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Chuckles a little:) --Exactly</i>, dear--though he does mean <i>well</i>, your father, you <i>know</i>--</p>

<p>DARIA: --Yeah, Mom--dad could make it <i>worse</i> without meaning to. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Then again, <i>Darren</i>--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Cuts her off:)</i> --Sweetie, we <i>shouldn't</i> ask Darren to talk to Quinn, even though I <i>know</i> he would do it in an <i>instant</i>. This is something that I think you and Quinn should settle between <i>yourselves</i>, seeing as this <i>"cousin"</i> thing has been going on for awhile, hmmm--?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:) "Settle"</i>, eh, Mom? Well, I think I may have some <i>boxing</i> gloves somewhere in my closet--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Sighs, then talks in a soft admonishing tone:)</i> Daria, I'm asking you to do this <i>verbally</i>, not physically. <i>(Holds out the tray to her, smiles quietly:)</i> Do this for me <i>free</i> just this once, okay, sweetie?</p>


     <p>Daria stared at her mother a moment more, then sighed--that damn <i>conscience</i> was speaking to her again.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Takes the tray:)</i> Okay, Mom, but don't blame <i>me</i> if you hear any <i>blood-curdling</i> sounds of <i>shouting</i> and <i>thumping</i> on the floor upstairs after a while. <i>(Walks away, while Helen shakes her head slowly, smirking)</i></p>



     <p>Quinn was laying down back on her bed, fuming, her arms crossed, looking at the ceiling (like <i>Daria</i>, though she did not know that). <i>No</i> fashions. <i>No</i> dates. A <i>curfew</i>. Why didn't they just <i>kill</i> her and get it <i>over</i> with? All of these three things over the span of a one whole <i>month</i>. All because she wanted to <i>"protect"</i> her popularity by saying that Daria was her <i>"cousin"</i> after all of this time. She bit her lower lip in frustration, then looked on her dresser at the cell phone she had kept in her room after talking to Jane. Quinn <i>seriously</i> thought about calling <i>Stacy</i> or <i>Tiffany</i>, eager to explain why she pretended that Daria was her <i>"cousin"</i>, possibly putting her own <i>spin</i> on the situation to <i>counter</i> Sandi's newfound discovery, like Quinn had done when Daria announced practically to the whole school that Quinn was her sister after the self-esteem course during their first week at Lawndale High. It was Quinn's <i>greatest</i> effort at spin control, but it was well <i>worth</i> it when every one of the <i>"popular"</i> people (<i>especially</i> Sandi,) thought that Daria was under the <i>influence</i> of a <i>"medicine"</i> that had <i>"affected her mind"</i> when she had made the speech, and, as a result, Quinn had <i>weathered</i> the <i>"storm".</i></p> 

     <p>Quinn then rolled over onto her stomach and sighed--knowing Sandi, she <i>already</i> probably had called Tiffany <i>immediately</i> after finding out the truth, and then Stacy when Stacy got home from Quinn's. <i>One</i> thing about Sandi --she <i>sure</i> worked fast when she needed to--especially at <i>Quinn's</i> expense, and judging by the <i>control</i> Sandi had over those two, they'd wait until she gave her <i>"approval"</i> to even <i>talk</i> to Quinn--after Sandi had taken her brother out on their "date". She half-expected for <i>Joey, Jeffrey,</i> and <i>Jim</i>--no, wait--<i>Jamie</i> to call by now and <i>cheer</i> her up with their <i>fighting</i> over her, but she then remembered that they were <i>out</i> of town with their families--<i>Stacy</i> had told her as much while she was over--otherwise, they would have been here as soon as they heard that the "moratorium" on any guy taking her out was <i>over</i>--not that it would any good <i>now</i>, since she couldn't go <i>anywhere</i>. She painfully closed her eyes for a moment, feeling alone.</p>

     <p><i>Where</i> was <i>Darren</i>? She was <i>sure</i> he'd be up here by now, <i>consoling</i> her. Quinn missed her big brother's soothing words, and she felt she needed it right now. She considered about talking to <i>Daria</i> for a second, then rolled her eyes at <i>that</i> thought. Despite her sister's little <i>"appeal"</i> downstairs, Quinn guessed that Daria was quietly <i>enjoying</i> Quinn's troubles--this, on top of everything else, was the <i>worse</i> thing from Quinn's viewpoint. The <i>"Brainy Sister"</i> was <i>laughing</i> at Quinn behind Quinn's back. Quinn knew she couldn't <i>compete</i> with her sister in the <i>"brains"</i> department--(well, until Darren came into the picture, and encouraged her to study for the Fashion Institute) having given that up long ago, but knew she had the advantages of <i>beauty</i> and <i>personality</i> in comparison to Daria's <i>intelligence</i>--at least it was <i>something</i> to hold in Daria's <i>face</i>--even though at times it <i>seemed</i> to Quinn that her sister did not <i>care</i> at all. Now, even <i>that</i> was gone.</p>

     <p>Suddenly, there was a knock at her door, and Quinn shot up from her bed, expecting that her "Big Bro" had arrived to cheer her up. She literally ran up to her bedroom door, and quickly opened it, smiling.</p>


<p>QUINN: Oh, Dar--<i>(sees Daria holding a tray full of food, surprised:) Daria</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan, smirks, shoves out the tray to her:)</i> I hate to disappoint you, <i>"sis"</i>, but it's just <i>me</i>--the </i>"other"</i> sibling. Here--mom thought you'd be hungary, so she asked me to deliver your food. You can <i>tip</i> me, oh, say--<i>15%</i>?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Scowls now:) Huh</i>! I'll have you to know, Daria, that I'm <i>not--(suddenly Quinn's stomach <b>growls</b>, Daria smirks even wider at this, and Quinn turns red-faced:) uhh</i>--those are just--um--<i>diet</i> sounds! That's it!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Rolls her eyes:) "Diet sounds"</i>, you say? <i>(Pauses:) Uh-huh</i>. Well, now--I guess I can <i>throw out</i> this sausage and rice casserole <i>Big Bro</i> prepared, then, so those <i>"diet sounds"</i> can continue their <i>"natural noises". (Begins to turn around)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Does a double-take, gasps:) Wait</i>! <i>Darren</i> made <i>that</i>? <i>(Narrows her eyes suspiciously at Daria, who turns back around to her:)</i> You're not <i>makin'</i> this up, are you? Since when does our <i>brother</i> know how to <i>cook</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Since he got <i>tired</i> of eating lasagna all of the damn time. <i>(Holds out the tray again:)</i> Are you gonna take the tray or not?</p>


     <p>After a moment, Quinn quietly took the tray, and went to her dresser, while Daria followed her in, shutting the door. Quinn, who was so <i>enamored</i> with the aroma of the food, did not notice her sister, and began to <i>ravishingly</i> dig into the cassarole, obviously hungary. Daria smirked at the sight and spoke.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(After a moment:)</i> You're <i>welcome</i>. Careful, Quinn--those <i>"diet sounds"</i> might be <i>"silenced"</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Goes at it, stuffs food into her mouth:)</i> Boy, I'll say--this is <i>great</i>, Dar--<i>(startled, some bits of food come out of her mouth:) AAAGH</i>! You're <i>still</i> here, Daria? What do you want?</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Walks by her, sits down on Quinn's bed, while Quinn watches her for a second, then resumes eating:)</i> To <i>talk</i>, sis--look, I told you I wanted us to get <i>past</i> the <i>"cousin"</i> thing, and I <i>meant</i> it, at least for our <i>brother's</i> sake. <i>(Pauses, obviously uncomfortable with her next words, crosses her arms:)</i> So, um, how <i>about</i> it? Can't we let <i>bygones be bygones</i>?</p>


     <p>Quinn stopped eating for a moment, and stared at her sister, not quite believing Daria to be <i>sincere</i>.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(Narrows her eyes:)</i> You're <i>really</i> serious about this, Daria?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> And <i>you're</i> not, Quinn? <i>Everything's</i> out, now
--so why <i>hang on</i> to the <i>anger</i> you feel at mom and dad--and at <i>me</i>? Besides, it's <i>just</i> a month--practically the <i>same</i> time we've known our bro, and <i>that</i> month has just about <i>flown</i> by us, so it'll be over sooner than you think. You're <i>still</i> gonna be in the Fashion Club as vice-president, and you can always--<i>(searches for the right words:)</i> uh--<i>catch up</i> on the latest fashion trends. <i>(Pauses:)</i> So--what do you <i>want</i> to do? <i>Keep</i> the anger--or let it <i>go</i>? I'm willing to meet you <i>half-way</i> on this--are you gonna meet me on the <i>other</i> half?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(After a moment, looks as if she is under <b>tremendous</b> strain--hesitates to get out the words, sighs:) Okay</i>, Daria--from this moment on, in <i>front</i> of everybody else in <i>public</i>--you an' I are--are--<i>(shudders slightly:) sisters. (Gives a weak smile, extends her hand:) Shake</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Gets up, extends her hand as well, smirks:) Shake. (Pauses, while her hand shakes Quinn's:)</i> You know, if the others <i>saw</i> us like this, we'd <i>never</i> live it down.</p>


     <p>Suddenly, as if on cue, the door <i>busted</i> open, and a smiling <i>Jake</i> came into the room holding his <i>camcorder</i>, and video-taping the now-startled sisters shaking hands, followed by Helen and Darren, who were also smiling.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Shrugs, in a sheepish tone:)</i> I <i>tried</i> to stop them, guys, I <i>really</i> did.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> And a <i>sterling</i> job you did at that, bro--I can see the <i>strain</i> from your doing so on your face. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I <i>knew</i> I should have <i>locked</i> that damn door. <i>(Darren laughs)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Looks as if she is about to cry:)</i> Oh, girls--this is such a <i>beautiful</i> moment! <i>(Rushes up to <b>hug</b> both of them)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smirks, remembers Daria's quip about Quinn using the "potty-room":)</i> Don't forget that it's a "historical" moment, too. <i>(Daria glares at her brother)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Horrified:) Muh--oom</i>! Can't you at least let me <i>finish</i> eating? <i>(Glances at Jake with the camcorder:) Daddy</i>! Make sure you get my <i>good</i> side! <i>Both</i> of them!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Horrified:)</i> Oh, <i>God</i>--not a <i>"sappy-personal-loving-family-moment"--Jane</i> had better <i>not</i> see this crap, bro--I'd <i>never</i> hear the end of it.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smirks, leans against the doorway, arms crossed:)</i> Hmmm--I don't know, sis--in fact, I might just send her a <i>copy</i> of this <i>"historical"</i> moment to <i>cherish</i> forever. <i>(Daria glares at her brother some more while Helen still holds her and Quinn, sobbing)</i></p>


     <p>The cell phone in Quinn's room suddenly rang. Darren, nearer to it than anyone, picked it up on the dresser and answered it.</p>


<p>DARREN: Hello--Morgendorffer residence.</p>

<p>VOICE: Oh, Darren--good. Like, you're the one I've been <i>expecting</i> to talk to.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Now sounding stoic:)</i> Uh--hello, <i>Sandi. (Daria and Quinn stare at him, while Helen and Jake are still going on about <b>"The Moment"</b>, not noticing who Darren's talking to)</i> Er--could you wait a moment, please? <i>(Covers the speaking end, looks at Helen and Jake:)</i> I was wondering if you two could leave me with Daria and Quinn for a few minutes, please?</p> 

<p>HELEN: <i>(After looking at Jake, releases Daria and Quinn:)</i> Of course, son--who's that on the phone?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(At a loss:)</i> Uh, well, it's, ah--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Jumps in:)</i> --It's <i>Jane</i>, Mom--she wants to talk to me, Quinn, and Darren about some, uh--ah--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Takes over from Daria:)</i> --Some <i>fashions</i>, Mom. <i>(Daria and Darren look at Quinn like she's insane)</i> She, uh, wants my <i>advice</i>, and Daria and Darren want to hear it as well. <i>(Laughs uneasily, while Daria and Darren look at each other uncomfortably)</i></p>


     <p>After a second, Helen smiled, and pulled a still-video-taping Jake out of the room--she was <i>so</i> happy about her daughters <i>"bonding"</i>, that she did not question Quinn's <i>weak</i> reason.</p>


<p>HELEN: <i>(Leaves:)</i> Well, all right, you three--tell Jane I said hello. <i>(Darren gives Daria and Quinn a look that says, "She brought <b>that</b>?", while Daria and Quinn look back at him as if to say, "What do <b>you</b> think"?)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Sad look:)</i> Aw, Helen, I'm not even finished yet!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Sighs:)</i> We can get some <i>more</i> taping done later, Jakey. <i>(Leaves the room, shuts the door)</i></p>


     <p>Almost instantly, Daria and Quinn gathered around Darren to listen to the conversation.</p>


<p>DARREN: Sorry, Sandi--something came up. I'm assuming you want to come up with a time for Friday's <i>(groans inwardly:)</i> ah--"date"?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(After a moment:)</i> Ummm--yes I would, Darren, and I would like to be shown a <i>good</i> time while we're out.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Leans over to Quinn, in a low voice:)</i> I think our bro would rather show her the <i>door. (Quinn smirks)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Clenches his teeth at Sandi's impertinence:)</i> Of course, Sandi--do you have any <i>ideas</i> as to where we should go?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(In her usual haughty "Valley Girl" tone:)</i> As a matter of fact, I <i>do</i>. We'll go to a restaurant called <i>Pastroni's. (Quinn's eyes light up, and her mouth hangs open, agape, while Daria drops an curious eyebrow at her reaction)</i> Afterwards, we can go to a <i>dance</i> at a nightclub called <i>The Haven. (Quinn frowns, now angry, balls her fists, grits her teeth)</i> If I think of something <i>else</i>, I'll let you <i>know</i> before you pick me up at my house at <i>7:00</i> this Friday night. <i>(Pauses, sneering sound:)</i> I'd speak to <i>Quinn</i>, but she has to understand that she's on a--<i>fashion sabbatical, (Quinn narrows her eyes)</i> and will not be <i>allowed</i> to speak to the other members of the Fashion Club for a <i>week</i>. I've <i>already</i> talked to Tiffany and Stacy, and they know the <i>"drill". (Snickering sound:)</i> Tell Quinn to <i>enjoy</i> her sabbatical. See you then, Darren. <i>(Hangs up)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks at the phone, frowns, clicks it off, gives it to Quinn, who tosses it on her bed, annoyed) Well</i>, now--she certainly has all of her ducks in a <i>row</i>, doesn't she?</p>

<p>DARIA: Too bad she isn't <i>one</i> of the ducks--I'd <i>shoot</i> her down in an instant in a booth at a carnival.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles softly at Daria's remark:)</i> At least Quinn was <i>right</i> about the <i>"fashion sabbatical"</i> thing--we don't have to worry about any <i>other</i> Fashion Club punishments Sandi might've <i>imposed</i> on her. Quinn, do you--<i>(stops when he sees what Quinn is doing)</i></p>


     <p>Quinn was stomping around in her room, <i>furious</i>, while Daria and Darren watched her curiously. She spun around, and glared at them both, frustrated.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>Damn it</i>! <i>Pastroni's</i>? That's the most <i>expensive</i> restaurant in the area, even <i>more</i> than <i>Chez Pierre</i>, an' it's not even <i>in</i> Carter county! I've wanted some guys to take <i>me</i> there since I came to Lawndale, but they weren't <i>rich</i> enough! <i>(Pauses:)</i> The <i>only</i> reason she's doin' <i>that</i> is to <i>outdo</i> me when I told her an' the rest of the Fashion Club about Darren takin' me to <i>Chez Pierre</i>!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> And the <i>"Can-You-Top-This"</i> competition continues.</p>


     <p>For the briefest of an instant, Darren wondered if Sandi <i>knew</i> of his secret, wanting him to take her to an <i>expensive</i> restaurant, then he reconsidered--this was the <i>deal</i> they had made to keep Quinn in the Fashion Club, and Sandi was going to get all she <i>could</i> out of it. He <i>froze</i> for a second, thinking--did <i>"could"</i> also mean that he'd have to go to <i>b--</i> no, <i>don't go <b>there</b>. Put <b>that</b> thought completely out of your mind.</i> He gave a quick glance at his sisters, and they seemed to think Sandi was getting "greedy", too.</p>


<p>DARREN: How <i>far</i> is this <i>Pastroni's</i> from Lawndale, Quinn?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Snorts:)</i> About <i>30</i> miles, bro. It's in nearby <i>Colby</i> county, near Leeville. <i>(Pauses, scowls:)</i> Then she wants to take you to <i>The Haven</i>!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>Dare</i> I ask, <i>where</i> and how <i>expensive</i> is <i>The Haven</i>, Quinn?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> About <i>15</i> miles from here, Daria, just inside Carter county--an' it's <i>ultra-expensive</i> like <i>Pastroni's</i>! It's a <i>high-class teen-themed nightclub</i>, an' I--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> --Let me guess--you tried to get guys to take you there, <i>too</i>, but their <i>pockets</i> weren't <i>deep</i> enough for <i>there</i> as well? <i>(Quinn frowns at Daria, who looks at Darren, concerned:)</i> Darren, I just thought of something--what Sandi is doing seems to be awfully <i>expensive</i> here. Yeah, I know you told me and Jane that you could <i>afford</i> this, but that was <i>before</i> we found out that she would <i>demand</i> the whole damn <i>state. Surely</i> there's <i>no</i> way you can take her out to the <i>boondocks</i>, and treat <i>us</i> while we're following you, too? Maybe I can <i>convince</i> Jane that we should stay <i>behind</i>--?</p>


     <p>Darren sighed, then walked up to his sister, and, like the time he did with Daria on the front porch, when they came back from the Zen that night following Jane's kissing him, put his hands on her shoulders, and spoke to her in an <i>assuring</i> tone. Unlike that previous time, Daria seemed to feel <i>comfortable</i> this go-around, for she <i>didn't</i> flinch. Quinn looked between the two, cocking an eyebrow at the exchange, privately <i>amazed</i> that her sister did <i>not</i> draw back--she supposed that even <i>Daria</i> was completely at <i>ease</i> with her brother, now, in a way like he had been there <i>all</i> of their lives--the <i>same</i> for Quinn.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks down at Daria:)</i> Sis, <i>don't</i> worry--I can--<i>afford</i> this. I <i>want</i> you and Jane there, okay? <i>(Ponders, realizes:)</i> Do you think Helen and Jake will <i>allow</i> you to take their <i>car</i> to follow us? If not, I can maybe get a <i>taxi</i>--?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> With the way mom and dad have been <i>after</i> me to get <i>out</i> more, bro, I can <i>swing</i> it. Here's the plan: You'll tell them that you're going by Jane's to take her out Friday--in your car, of course, and I'll tell them that I'm going out with a <i>guy</i> at the same time, leaving when you do in one of mom and dad's cars, then <i>I</i> can swing by Jane's, and pick her up, and we'll follow you to Sandi's, and then to those places. <i>(Quinn snorts and rolls her eyes) What</i>?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>Daaaaria</i>! You can't just <i>take</i> the car and say <i>you're</i> gonna go and pick up a <i>guy</i>! It just doesn't <i>work</i> that way! It's gotta be the <i>guy</i> who picks up the girl, <i>not</i> the other way around! Believe me, I <i>know</i>! Mom and dad would be kinda <i>suspicious</i>!</p>

<p>DARIA: Quinn, check the <i>calendar</i>--this is the year <i>2000</i>, not the turn of the <i>last</i> century. Mom and dad <i>know</i> that some <i>girls</i> pick up some <i>guys</i> in this day and age, and they're gonna be <i>eager</i> enough to believe that I would go out with a <i>biker</i> if that's what it would take to get me out of the damn house. <i>(Sneers:) You</i> pick guys up <i>all</i> of the time, right? Only you <i>don't</i> have to drive <i>cars</i> to do so, if you catch my <i>drift. (Quinn glares at her while Darren sighs to himself)</i> I'll just explain that the guy's car is being <i>repaired</i>, and that he'll be riding with me.</p>

<p>DARREN: Then it's <i>settled</i>--I'll give you and Jane some money for gas and food, and everything will be fine, though I don't know <i>what</i> you'll do about the <i>nightclub</i>. It could be <i>hard</i> to try and watch us while all of those people are around, though I'll do <i>my</i> part if Sandi tries any <i>hanky-panky</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: No problem, Darren--Jane and I can <i>handle</i> ourselves. <i>You'll</i> be there to cover our <i>asses</i> if something goes wrong, like say, some <i>idiot</i>, who'll be turned <i>down</i> by me or Jane if he asks us for a <i>dance</i>, and tries to <i>harass</i> us.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Well, I guess you guys know what you're doin'. Don't forget to get <i>reservations</i>, too. <i>(Goes to her dresser, pulls out the drawer, takes out a menu labeled <b>"Pastroni's"</b>, gives it to Darren:)</i> Here--call 'em for you, Sandi, Daria, an' Jane. The number's on the inside of the front cover--they can take reservations <i>24</i> hours in advance.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan, smirks:)</i> Quinn has a menu to the place--<i>why</i> doesn't that <i>surprise</i> me?</p> 

<p>QUINN: <i>(Waves Daria off:)</i> Daria, I have menus to <i>every</i> expensive place in the area! <i>(Smirks at Darren:)</i> I could've asked <i>Darren</i> to take me to <i>Pastroni's</i>, but, hey, he's my <i>bro</i>--I couldn't do <i>that</i> to him, could I?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> No, I suppose you couldn't, sis. <i>(Pauses, looks down at the menu, opens it:)</i> Now, I'll call on my phone, and--<i>(cocks a slight eyebrow:) oooooh</i>--er, <i>$60</i> for a <i>steak</i>? <i>Hmm--interesting. $45</i> for a bowl of <i>soup</i>? This--is--<i>well, now--(looks for words to speak)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Looks up dreamily, sighs:) Yeaaah</i>--isn't it <i>great</i>? I'll <i>go</i> there, one day--you'll <i>see--</i></p>

<p>DARIA: --Yeah, if it doesn't work out at the Fashion Institute, you can always apply for a <i>job</i> there serving <i>tables</i>, and <i>fulfill all of your dreams. (Quinn looks at her disdainfully, while Darren quietly slips out to his room to call the restaurant, chuckling)</i> Well, now that our little <i>"bonding"</i> session is over, much to my <i>delight, (reaches to the cell phone)</i> I'm gonna call Jane if Darren doesn't first, and--<i>(phone starts to ring)</i> I do believe that phone has a <i>mind</i> of its <i>own. (Clicks it on:)</i> Hello?</p>

<p>VOICE: Um--is <i>Quinn</i> there?</p>

<p>DARIA: Yes, your fellow <i>"fashion-Nazi"</i> is here--<i>(looks at Quinn:)</i> so much for "Lord Sandi's" <i>decree</i>--it's <i>Stacy. (Gives the phone to Quinn, smirks:)</i> I know you'll probably be here for the rest of the <i>night</i> talking to her, <i>(Quinn gives Daria a smug look)</i> so I'll ask for the use of <i>Darren's</i> phone after he finishes calling <i>"Restaurant Fort Knox"</i>. See ya. <i>(Leaves)</i></p>


     <p>Quinn sat down on her bed, and spoke.</p>


<p>QUINN: Hi, Stacy--why are you callin' <i>me</i>? Sandi's <i>forbidden</i> you an' Tiffany from doin' so for a <i>week</i>!</p>

<p>STACY: <i>(Now becomes frantic:)</i> Hey, Quinn--<i>I know, I know</i>! I realize I'm taking a <i>chance</i> in doing this, but <i>why</i> did Sandi want us <i>not</i> to? <i>(Gasps with realization:)</i> Oh, Quinn--<i>please</i> don't tell Sandi I called!</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Rolls her eyes, exasperated:)</i> Don't worry, Stacy, I won't. <i>(Cocks an eyebrow, curious:)</i> You mean, you <i>don't</i> know why I can't talk to you guys?</p>

<p>STACY: <i>(Sounding like she's about to <b>cry</b>:) No</i>! All Sandi said was that you were under <i>"fashion sabbatical"</i> for an entire week! <i>(Adds after a second:)</i> You didn't wear your <i>lavander polyester skirt with that lemon cotton midriff shirt</i>, did you?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Makes a face:) Ugh</i>! <i>No</i> way! I'd sooner <i>die</i> than to do <i>that</i>! <i>(Pauses, frowns, confused:)</i> I thought for <i>sure</i> Sandi would've said something to the both of you by now.</p>

<p>STACY: <i>(Sniffles:)</i> N-no, she didn't. <i>(In a quiet tone:)</i> W-what happened, Quinn?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Sighs:)</i> You might as well know, Stacy--God knows everyone else will this fall--<i>(hesitates, takes a deep breath:)</i> Daria's my--my--my--<i>sister</i>, an' <i>not</i> my cousin, an' Sandi <i>found</i> out about it, an' is <i>punishing</i> me for it. <i>(Thought v.o.: Just like mom an' dad are.)</i></p>


     <p>There was a long silence on the other end of the phone, and for a moment, Quinn thought Stacy did not hear her. She was about to speak again when Stacy spoke in a <i>very</i> quiet tone, almost a <i>whisper</i>.</p>


<p>STACY: <i>(Meekly:) O-oh. (Pauses:)</i> So, uh--w-what's <i>wrong</i> with a <i>"brain"</i> being your sister? <i>(Quinn looks surprised a bit at Stacy's words, then Stacy suddenly gasps:)</i> T-that means Darren's <i>your</i> brother, too? <i>(Squeals, then realizes:)</i> Quinn, <i>why</i> would you be ashamed of <i>him</i> being your brother?
<i>(Quinn looks shocked)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: Um--Stacy, did you <i>hear</i> what I said? <i>Daria's</i> my sister? Yeah, Darren's my <i>"Big Bro"</i>, but--</p>

<p>STACY: <i>(Not hearing Quinn, on a roll:)</i> Daria's art friend is <i>so</i> lucky! If <i>I</i> had a <i>hunky</i> brother like you, I'd <i>brag</i> about it all over Lawndale! I'd try to make guys <i>jealous</i> by <i>pretending</i> he was my <i>boyfriend</i>, and I'd--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Looks up, tries to be patient:) --Staaacy! (Thought v.o.: Great--now I'm sounding like <b>Sandi</b>.)</i> I--well, I tried to do <i>something</i> like that when, I--um, first <i>introduced</i> him to you all in the Pizza King.</p>

<p>STACY: <i>(Sounding confused:)</i> Huh? Quinn, I don't understand.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Bites her lower lip, then grimly goes on:)</i> Well, Stacy, you--<i>see--(phone rings on the line)</i> hang on, it's probably a client for my mom, or something. <i>(Clicks phone off, then on:)</i> Hello?</p>

<p>VOICE: Hey...Quinn.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Raises both eyebrows, surprised:) Tiffany? You're</i> goin' against Sandi?</p>

<p>TIFFANY: <i>(Hesitates:)</i> Um...yeah...but...would...you...not...tell--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Cuts her off:)</i> --Don't worry, I won't. In fact, Stacy's on the phone, too. Lemme switch on the three-way call connect, and we can <i>all</i> talk to each other. <i>(Does so, pauses:)</i> I hope you guys can <i>forgive</i> me for what I'm about to <i>tell</i> you--if you <i>can't</i>, well--<i>(voice trails off, looks away)</i></p>

<p>TIFFANY: Hey...Stacy. Quinn...what...are...you...talking...about?</p>

<p>STACY: Hi, Tiffany! That's what I was wondering about, too.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Sighs heavily:)</i> Well, like I was about to tell Stacy, it happened when you guys first met Darren--</p>


     <p>The day-and-a-half leading to Friday passed quickly. Darren had been "briefed" by a suddenly <i>happy-looking</i> Quinn over what to expect from Sandi, such as Sandi's likes and dislikes in food and what she does and does not do on dates, based on what Quinn had heard from boys who had gone out with Sandi (after going out with Quinn <i>first</i>, of course). Darren had been able to secure the dinner reservations from <i>Pastroni's</i> for him, Sandi, Daria, and Jane, with Daria and Jane in a spot where Sandi could not see Daria and Jane. (Secretly, Darren had made sure of the locations--that is by sending a special <i>"payment"</i> to the restaurant's management, and insuring the preferred spots there.)</p>

     <p>During this time also, Darren had taken out Jane at night to a movie at the <i>Playhouse 99</i> theatre, seeing the French film, <i>"Les Miserables"</i>, a movie Jane wanted to see, just to help <i>reassure</i> her that he had absolutely <i>no</i> interest in Sandi--though Jane <i>insisted</i> that she did not feel threatened by a <i>"shallow, egotistical, self-centered, fashion-obsessed twit like Sandi Griffin"</i>. He did so <i>anyway</i>, especially when Daria had privately conferred to him that Jane had appeared to be a little <i>depressed</i>, seemingly having <i>second</i> thoughts about agreeing to the "date" while she and Daria had gone with Darren during the same day to the arcade again.</p>

     <p>In the meantime, Daria's little plan to get the car (Helen's red SUV in this case) <i>worked</i>, with a delighted and estatic Helen and Jake, who were happy Daria was going out on her own, and all too willing to allow her to do so. At first, Helen had suggested that Daria and her "companion" go out with Darren and Jane on a <i>double-date</i>, but Daria quickly suggested that she and her "date" were going to a <i>different</i> place than Jane and Darren. <i>Quinn</i> also backed up Daria, and that little gesture in itself was more than enough for Helen and Jake to allow Daria to do so.</p>

     <p>Jake had Darren come to see what a consultant does for a living, showing Darren around the office, and generally <i>bragged</i> about his work. Darren listened politely to his birth father, occasionally smiling between Jake's loud-yet-proud boastings. A difficult-to-please, attractive, female client that wanted to try and sell a new invention about a type of eyeglass, came into Jake's office, and after seeing and talking to <i>Darren</i>, promptly gave Jake her <i>okay</i>, signing the proper papers for a contract. Jake, completely <i>beyond</i> delighted, proclaimed to Darren that <i>Jake's</i> selling skills went a long way in getting the contract. Just as the woman was leaving, she slipped a piece of paper into Darren's hand--it was her <i>phone number</i>! Darren looked at it, becoming wide-eyed. He quietly balled it up, and threw it into Jake's <i>wastebasket</i>.</p> 

     <p>Privately, Darren had hoped to hear something, <i>anything</i>, from Woo on Sanchez by now, but there <i>still</i> was nothing. Darren then knew he had to be <i>patient</i>--after all, Woo <i>was</i> doing his best. Darren decided to concentrate on getting this <i>ridiculous</i> "date" with Sandi out of the way for Quinn, and the sooner, the better.</p> 

     <p>Darren also remembered to call his <i>uncle William</i> about the NTSB's findings on the crash from earlier in the week, concluding that a call to him tonight would come <i>after</i> the "date". He was getting ready for the "date" for this evening in his room with Daria, who was sitting on his bed. Darren was looking over his clothes he was going to wear when Quinn came in, smiling.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(In her sing-songy tone:) Hiii</i>, guys!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sounding a little depressed:)</i> Hello, sis. <i>(Goes back to looking in his bag)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks at Quinn:)</i> You're sounding awfully <i>happy</i> for someone who's bro is about to make the ultimate <i>sacrifice</i> for you.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Rolls her eyes:) Pleeease</i>, Daria--I'm the <i>last</i> person that would wanna see our bro out with Sandi tonight, you <i>know</i> that. I'm just happy 'cause mom an' dad are lettin' me go over to <i>Stacy's</i> tonight for a <i>slumber party</i>, an' Tiffany's comin' over there, too! <i>(Daria and Darren look at each other, surprised)</i> I've been <i>workin' on</i>--er, <i>talkin'</i> to mom an' dad since right after I got off th' phone with Stacy an' Tiffany.</p> 

<p>DARREN: Ah, <i>that's</i> why you've been sounding <i>happy</i> the last day-and-a-half.
<i>(Goes back to looking in his bag)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Looks away slightly:)</i> Well, um--that's <i>partly</i> true, bro. I was happy <i>first</i> 'cause Tiffany an' Stacy <i>forgave</i> me for lyin' to them about Daria an' you, Darrren.</p>

<p>DARIA: Hold the <i>phone</i>--and I don't mean the one you're always <i>talking</i> on--you were able to get <i>"Dumb and Dumber"</i> to <i>forgive</i> you for lying to them, <i>defying</i> Sandi in the process, I might add, as well as arrange this apparent <i>secret</i> sleepover with those two--and <i>then</i> you got mom and dad to let you get <i>off</i> of curfew to go over to Stacy's and have your little <i>"fashion powwow"</i>? What did you do--catch mom and dad <i>making out</i> on the couch again, and are holding <i>that</i> over their heads as some sort of <i>guilt-trip</i> to get them to let you go? <i>(Darren stops looking in his bag for a moment and looks at Daria strangely)</i> I'll explain <i>later</i>, bro.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Closes her eyes, shakes her head, disgusted at the thought of seeing such a sight:) EWWWWWW</i>! Don't <i>go</i> there, Daria! Actually, it was 'cause of what happened between you an' me the other night, with makin' up an' all. <i>(Giggles:)</i> I just took <i>advantage</i> of our parent's <i>good</i> feeling's at th' time, and my natural <i>charm</i> took over from there!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Rolls her eyes:) Naturally</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: I still can't go out on a date for at least <i>two</i> weeks, <i>includin'</i> tonight, the <i>same</i> for buyin' any clothes. Th' curfew will last for <i>three</i> weeks, with th' exception bein' <i>tonight</i>. I tried to get mom an' dad to make it <i>two</i> weeks as well, but mom said if I did that, I couldn't go over Stacy's tonight. So, I said I'd do it.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Glances at her while looking at his dress shirts:)</i> You'd trade a <i>day</i> for a <i>week</i>, sis? I don't get it.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Gets a small scheming smirk on her face:)</i> Oh, tonight will be <i>worth</i> it, bro--<i>trust</i> me. <i>(Daria cocks an eyebrow at this)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Does the <i>Fashion Now</i> TV show have a special on not wearing baggy <i>clothing</i> while you have baggy <i>eyes</i>?</p> 

<p>QUINN: <i>(Snorts:) Really</i> funny, Daria. <i>(Pauses, looks her over:)</i> You're not gonna wear your--ugh--<i>regular</i> clothin' to <i>Pastroni's</i>, are ya?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Gets up off the bed, twirls around with her arms stretched out, similar to a ballerina:)</i> Do you <i>like</i> it? I call it, the <i>"To hell with what anybody else thinks"</i> look. <i>(Darren tries to hold back his laugh while Quinn frowns)</i> And get <i>this:</i>
--I don't have to put on <i>any</i> damn thing <i>else</i>! It's <i>amazing</i>! I've already convinced <i>Jane</i> to do the same, too. Maybe we could both go into business convincing <i>others</i> to do it as well! What do <i>you</i> think? Could we pull it <i>off</i>?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Clenches her teeth:)</i> Damn it, Daria! <i>Pastroni's</i> is a <i>high</i>-class restaurant! You should at least <i>look</i> like you belong there! <i>(Sneers:)</i> Besides, you an' Jane don't wanna draw any <i>attention</i> to yourselves by people lookin' at you <i>strangely</i>, do ya?</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sits back down:)</i> People do that all the time <i>anyway</i>, Quinn. Jane and I will keep our "unique" styles, thank you. <i>(Quinn slowly shakes her head)</i></p> 

<p>DARREN: It's okay, Quinn--Jane and Daria will be sitting <i>away</i> from us, out of the way. <i>(Looks for some pants to go with his shirt)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Walks up beside Darren, snorts:)</i> Well, I suppose that's a relief--at least you guys won't <i>embarass</i> Darren if you do draw attention. <i>(Looks at Darren's clothing:)</i> Do you need any help with matchin' your stuff for tonight, bro?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(After a moment, shrugs:)</i> Sure, Quinn. <i>(Holds up a charcoal-colored dress shirt:)</i> What do think of this color with my white dress pants?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Puts her index finger to the bottom of her mouth, ponders for a moment:)</i> Hmmm--that could work. Maybe you can match your black coat with that.</p>


     <p>Having just come in from work, Helen came into Darren's room smiling, and began to <i>beam</i> with pride at seeing her daughters and son together.</p>


<p>HELEN: <i>Hellooo</i>, everyone! I see you're getting ready quite <i>early</i> for your date with <i>Jane</i>, son. <i>(Looks at her watch:)</i> It's only <i>5:15</i> in the afternoon.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Uneasily chuckles:)</i> Oh, uh, right--5:15. Well, one can't afford to be <i>too</i> unprepared, right? I'm just--looking for the right thing to wear with Quinn's help.</p>

<p>HELEN: I see--Daria, maybe you should be getting ready for <i>your</i> date with--what was his <i>name</i> again? <i>Martin</i>, I believe--?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Yeah, Mom--and for the record, I <i>am</i> ready. Ask <i>Quinn. (Darren chuckles to himself quietly)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Looks at Quinn, confused:) What--</i>?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Sighs:)</i> Never mind, Mom--I'll tell you about it later. Speaking of gettin' ready, I'd better get ready to go over Stacy's tonight. Bro, that outfit will look <i>perfect</i> on you! Sis, um, have a good time with that <i>"Marty"</i> fellow! Byeeee! <i>(Leaves)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Thanks, sis--have a good time.</p>

<p>DARIA: Yeah, don't let the <i>"fashion bugs"</i> bite. <i>(Looks at Helen:)</i> Where's <i>dad</i>? Is he gonna burn the late-afternoon oil, or something?</p>

<p>HELEN: Your father had a late after-work meeting with a client. He'll be here in another hour.</p> 

<p>DARREN: You two have any <i>plans</i> while we're all gone?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Oh, we'll think of <i>something</i>, Darren--we'll think of something. <i>(Daria shudders to herself, knowing what her mom means, by <b>"something"</b>, while Darren shrugs, and tends to his clothes)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to Woo's Detective Agency, Los Angeles, about an hour later)</i></p>



     <p>Gerald Woo just came in from yet <i>another</i> cold trail, slumping down in his chair, looking frustrated, and staring into space. It was as if the whole <i>ground</i> had swallowed up Sanchez, for there was <i>absolutely</i> no sign of anyone seeing him anywhere. Yet, for all of this, Woo's gut instincts told him that Sanchez <i>had</i> to be nearby. He and his staff had checked at all of the nearby airports and bus and train stations, quietly flashing Sanchez's picture, but no people who worked at any of those places could recall seeing him--that could indicate that Sanchez was still in the L.A. area, having never left--if that were the case, <i>why</i> had he not?</p>  
 
     <p>Woo and his people had also checked in any old hangouts they thought he'd be at, going back over Sanchez's history, according to his police records. They had a <i>small</i> break when a prostitute (Woo had discovered from the hacked police files that Sanchez had a "weakness" for these types of women) told Leroy of meeting someone of Sanchez's description, but a subsequent check in a nearby hotel turned up nothing. When Woo called Leonard Potter to return Potter's call, Woo half-expected some sort of new information Potter may have had, only to receive <i>disappointment</i> when Potter told him nothing of any value.</p>

     <p>Woo leaned back into his chair, rubbing his face, and closing his eyes, trying to catch a quick nap. He had had very little sleep since promising Darren Appleton about working <i>nonstop</i> on finding Sanchez. The quiet darkness became a welcome distraction, as he began to slumber off into dreamland, snoring lightly.</p>

     <p>He was suddenly jarred out of his sleep by a smirking <i>Carla</i>, who was nudging his shoulder.</p>


<p>WOO: <i>(Blinks his eyes open:)</i> Uh, whatzat, Carla? Who--</p>

<p>CARLA: Geez, Woo--I tried <i>beeping</i> you, but you must've really been under. It's <i>David</i>, and he has some info about Sanchez. Line two. <i>(Leaves)</i></p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Wipes his eyes:)</i> David about Sanchez? Thank you, Carla. <i>(Punches line two:)</i> Go ahead, David.</p>

<p>DAVID: Woo? I <i>know</i> where Sanchez is.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Suddenly sits up, alert:)</i> You <i>do</i>, David? Where?</p>

<p>DAVID: At some run-down apartments called--<i>(pauses:)</i> let me make sure I wrote this down right on my pad here--the--<i>"Suni Apartments"</i>.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Looks up, tries to remember:) Suni</i>--Suni--<i>(realizes:)</i> that <i>dump</i>? I thought it was <i>condemned</i> by the building inspector last year! How far are you from it?</p> 

<p>DAVID: About 15 minutes. I'm standing here at the corner of <i>Hikhali</i> and <i>Nobles</i> with a <i>vagrant</i> who said that he saw Sanchez coming out of a Hispanic-themed nightclub located near the Suni night before last with a prostitute. He remembered it because the vagrant tried to ask Sanchez for some money to get some food, but Sanchez <i>pushed</i> him down, and <i>kicked</i> him a couple of times, then Sanchez and the prostitute left <i>laughing</i>, while the vagrant lie on the ground in pain.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Shakes his head slowly, frowns:) Charming</i> fellow.</p> 

<p>DAVID: <i>(Snorting sound:) Tell</i> me about it--anyway, the vagrant happened to watch them go into the Suni, then crawled away to nurse his wounds. I guess uh--one moment, Woo--<i>(voice goes off:)</i> what's your name, again?</p>

<p>VOICE: <i>(In the background, sounding bitter:) Lew</i>.</p>

<p>DAVID: Yeah--Lew, here--thought that calling the police would do <i>no</i> good since he's a, well, a <i>"lowly"</i> vagrant, and they wouldn't give a <i>damn</i>.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Gets up out of his seat, stretches:)</i> I see. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Does uh--<i>"Lew"</i> want <i>something</i> in return for his--<i>"troubles"</i>?</p>

<p>DAVID: Yeah--he wants about <i>$50</i> and Sanchez's <i>ass</i> in jail.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Heh--give "Lew" <i>$300</i>, and give him that number at the employment agency where I can <i>guarantee</i> that he'll get a <i>job</i> where he can get back on his feet--he can buy some clothes and clean himself up. Oh, and call <i>Leroy</i> so he can join us. Stay where you are. After I call <i>Darren Appleton</i> to let him know we found Sanchez, I'm on my way.</p>

<p>DAVID: I <i>figured</i> you'd want Leroy, so I've <i>already</i> called him. We'll be here waiting for you, Woo--and I'll see to "Lew" like you said.</p>

<p>WOO: Excellent, David--thank "Lew" again. See you. <i>(Hangs up, dials some numbers)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the Morgendorffer's, the same time)</i></p>



     <p>Helen Morgendorffer was going over her documents from her law firm while walking down the hallway to go downstairs to be with Jake, who was now at home and fixing dinner for the two in the kitchen. The work had <i>piled up</i> while she was on vacation, and she <i>still</i> had not caught up yet. She wanted to finish it up as soon as possible so she could be with him for a quiet--and maybe a <i>sexy</i> time alone with Jake, while Daria, Quinn, and Darren were out. She sighed contentedly when she thought about how they were all getting along, and how her son had helped bring Daria and Quinn closer together. As she was walking by Darren's room, the cell phone he had in there had started to ring. Helen smirked for a moment--it was the <i>first</i> time she could recall hearing it ring. She had known that her son had used it to talk to his friends or relatives about his birth family while staying with them, but she and Jake had decided that when he was ready to discuss them, he would do so on <i>his</i> terms--like his <i>adopted</i> parents, and <i>how</i> they died. She had <i>regretted</i> privately about inquiring about them that day while they were at <i>Milligan's</i>, and it <i>bothered</i> her slightly. Helen was about to go in his room and get Darren's cell phone when she stopped, somewhat <i>hesitant</i>--perhaps feeling that she would be <i>meddling</i> in his private affairs if she picked up his phone. After a moment more, she quietly pushed his door open, and answered the phone--out of a sense of <i>curiousity</i> more than anything else, maybe she could get an <i>idea</i> about how his friends or relatives were.</p>


<p>HELEN: <i>(In her falsetto voice:) Helloooo</i>?</p>

<p>VOICE: Uh, hello--is Darren A--er, <i>Coverton</i>, there?</p>

<p>HELEN: No, I'm afraid not. He just left for the evening, and won't be back until later tonight. May I take a message?</p>

<p>VOICE: <i>(After a moment:)</i> Yes--tell him to call <i>(pauses:) "G.W. about Sanchez".</i>
He'll know what I'm talking about, Ms.--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>Mrs.</i> Morgendorffer, and you may call me <i>Helen</i>,  Mr.--</p>

<p>VOICE: Uh, <i>Gerald</i>--Mr. Gerald. It was nice talking to you, er, <i>Helen</i>. Thank you. <i>(Hangs up quickly)</i></p>


     <p>Helen frowned slightly, perplexed, looked at the cell phone, then clicked it off. She scribbled what <i>"Mr. Gerald"</i> told her on a small sheet of paper, then put it beside the charger.</p>


<p>HELEN: What an <i>odd</i> man. <i>(Puts back the phone on the charger, then leaves the room)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to William Appleton's Park Avenue apartment, about five minutes <b>earlier</b>)</i></p>


     <p>William Appleton sat on his couch looking in some business-related files. He decided to leave the office early today to get a quick start on the weekend, having put up with a <i>hectic</i> week, with what the NTSB "found out" about the crash, <i>Potter's</i> attempts to supply Woo with information, which fell <i>flat</i>, (much to William's amusement) and Sam Norwood's <i>futile</i> efforts in trying to find a legal loophole that would enable William to take the Appleton conglomerate from his <i>"nephew"</i>. Add the deal he just completed with the Saudi Arabian businessman over the pipeline near Mecca, and putting <i>Constance Waters</i> on a plane to Japan, thus <i>effectively</i> putting her in a corner of the world where she'd poise <i>no</i> threat to him, not to mention speculating where that <i>ignoramus</i> Sanchez was, and he felt he <i>deserved</i> some time off. <i>Benny Lodell</i> suddenly emerged from William's bathroom, wiping off his hands with a towel, then sitting down beside William on the couch.</p>


<p>BENNY: What do you want to do about dinner, Boss? <i>(Smirks:)</i> Wanna <i>paint the town</i>? Find some girls, and--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(While looking in the files, cuts him off:) --No</i>. We have too much work still to do, so we can order in. I want--</p>


     <p>William's cell phone suddenly rang, and he answered it.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Curtly, while still looking in his files:)</i> Yes, what is it?</p>

<p>VOICE: <i>(Sneering sound:)</i> Hey there, Mr. Appleton--you're just the man I've been wanting to talk to, <i>not</i> your little <i>"guard-dog"</i>, Lodell. I tried to call you at your office, but you were gone home already. I called Mr. Lodell's apartment, but I was told he was with you, so I called here.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow, now curious:)</i> Eh? Who <i>is</i> this?</p>

<p>VOICE: Why, don't you know me? It's <i>Sanchez. (William's eyes light up, and his mouth is suddenly agape, which draws Benny's attention)</i> I'm calling about my <i>"second"</i> payment.</p>


     <p>William quickly motioned to Benny, who turned on the intercom that connected the speaker to the phone so they could both hear, much like they did when Darren had called a few weeks ago.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Gets up, faux smile and friendly tone:)</i> Why, <i>Julio</i>! <i>(Benny's eyes light up, gets off the couch)</i> We've been <i>trying</i> to locate you, so we can give you your second payment! Obviously, the NTSB has concluded the crash was an <i>accident</i>, so we can <i>close</i> out our <i>"business"</i>, and go our separate ways. It was <i>$20,000</i> as agreed upon, right?</p>

<p>JULIO: Well, I've been <i>thinking</i> about that amount, and for <i>some</i> reason, I don't think it's <i>enough--(William and Benny frown at each other)</i> I did a <i>great</i> job on that fuel valve, making <i>fools</i> out of the NTSB, and no one suspected a <i>damn</i> thing. Don't you think I deserve a little <i>more</i> than $20,000? I'm kinda running <i>low</i> on cash reserves here, if you know what I mean.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Clenched teeth while talking:) Oh</i>? How <i>much</i> more do you think you deserve, Julio?</p>

<p>JULIO: Oh, about <i>$200,000-- (Benny is about to say something when William motions to him to silence)</i> that should make us even. What do <i>you</i> think?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Tries to keep his composure:) Hmmm</i>--that <i>much</i>, huh? Maybe--<i>(the phone rings on the line:)</i> could you hold on for a second, Julio? There's another call coming in, okay?</p> 

<p>JULIO: <i>(Begins to sound angry:)</i> Hey, don't cut <i>me--(William cuts him off)</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Clicks his phone on, again:)</i> Yes, this this William Appleton.</p>

<p>VOICE: <i>(In the background, it's obvious there's a moving car sound interminged with the voice:)</i> Boss, I'm following <i>Woo</i> with our <i>other</i> man in our car--Woo's <i>found</i> where Sanchez is. What should I do? <i>(Benny gets a panicked look on his face, while William stays calm)</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(His voice matching his calmness, then begins to grin slowly in realization, which Benny picks up slowly, then he grins the same way:)</i> Do you know <i>where</i> Woo's going?</p>

<p>VOICE: A place called the <i>"Suni Apartments"</i>. Woo's going to meet his men first on the way there, and they're then going there to see Sanchez.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Narrows his eyes:)</i> Do <i>you</i> or the man you're with <i>know</i> where these <i>"Suni Apartments"</i> are? Talk to your partner--this is <i>very</i> important.</p>

<p>VOICE: <i>(After consulting with the man beside him:) Yessir</i>, we do.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Grins sinisterly:) Excellent</i>. Hang on a second, would you? <i>(Clicks line to Sanchez, in a faux codensending tone:) Julio</i>? Are you still there?</p>

<p>JULIO: <i>(In a furious tone:)</i> You're <i>damn</i> right I am! I didn't like to be cut off like that, and--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Cuts him off:)</i> --I'm <i>so</i> sorry for doing that--we had a <i>$100 million</i> deal that we have to close today--you know how it is, business and all. <i>(Pauses:)</i> You said you wanted <i>$200,000</i>, right?</p>

<p>JULIO: <i>(Sounding bitter:)</i> Yeah, and if I'm cut off <i>again</i> like that, the price will <i>double</i>, got that? <i>(William's visage turns dark along with Benny's)</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Then smirks sinisterly, resumes his calm voice:)</i> Of course, Julio, I understand <i>perfectly</i>. There's <i>no</i> need for <i>hostility</i> here, we're all <i>friends</i>. I <i>agree</i> to your amount. <i>Where</i> are you?</p>

<p>JULIO: <i>(Sounding stunned for a second, then delighted:)</i> You DO? I mean--uh, a place called the <i>"Suni Apartments"</i> in Los Angeles. I can meet one of your men--</p>


<p>WILLIAM: --Yes, of course! I'll <i>send</i> a man over to these <i>"Suni Apartments"</i> and have him give you what you so <i>richly deserve</i>. What's your room number?</p>

<p>JULIO: <i>(Still sounding excited:)</i> Room 308, Mr. Appleton, under the name <i>"Gonzalez". When</i> will your man be here so I can expect him? I could give him <i>directions</i>--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Looks up, faux concern:)</i> --No--no, that <i>won't</i> be necessary. I'm <i>sure</i> he knows <i>where</i> it is. Now, as for when he'll arrive there--ah, say <i>10 minutes</i>? Be <i>sure</i> to be there, now--and <i>stay</i> in your room--we don't want to draw <i>attention</i> from any curious tenants.</p>

<p>JULIO: No sweat. <i>(Hangs up)</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Frowns:) "No sweat"</i>, indeed. <i>(Clicks phone back on:)</i> All right--here are your orders--<i>eliminate</i> Sanchez--he's become a <i>problem</i>, and has to be <i>dealt</i> with, understood? Break off from Woo, and get to these damn <i>"Suni Apartments"</i>, and do the deed, then get the <i>hell</i> out of Los Angeles as soon as you can, and meet me in this "Lawndale" place <i>tomorrow</i> around 3:00 p.m., you understand that? I want you to get in touch with our man there, and he'll give you directions on how to get there, and what <i>other</i> things we'll need to <i>deal</i> with my so-called <i>"nephew". (Benny looks at William strangely)</i></p>

<p>VOICE: Yessir--we'd like to add that Woo also tried to call <i>Darren Appleton</i> about Sanchez, but he wasn't there. He left a message with Darren Appleton's birth mother.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: Don't trouble yourself about my <i>"nephew"</i>--at least not <i>yet</i>, anyway --I have a man watching him--you just deal with Sanchez first, got that?</p>

<p>VOICE: Yessir--Sanchez is as good as <i>gone. (Hangs up)</i></p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Comes up beside William:)</i> Well, that's that, Boss--what did you mean by wanting those two with you in that <i>"Lawndale"</i> place tomorrow? You said you wanted to deal with your <i>"nephew"</i> personally, but I never thought you'd want to--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(In a calm voice, turns to Benny, cuts him off:)</i> --No, you <i>didn't</i> think, Benny, and I'll tell you what I'm going to do in my <i>own</i> time, but <i>first</i>--</p>


     <p>Before Benny knew it, William had <i>backslapped</i> him across the face, doing it <i>so</i> hard, that Benny had gone over the coffee table, falling down on the Oriental rug, along with the business files, and spilling a pitcherful of water that was on the table as well. He looked up at William holding his face where William hit him, stunned.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Looks down at Benny darkly:) That</i> was for <i>hiring</i> that <i>exortionist</i> in the first <i>damn</i> place. I <i>suggested</i> to you to hire a professional hit man, but you wanted someone <i>"cheaper"</i>. Well, that little "cheap" <i>bastard</i> would've <i>bled</i> us to death, Benny--we'd <i>always</i> be blackmailed by Sanchez--we'd be his money "lifeline" <i>forever</i>. You were supposed to make this a <i>clean</i> thing, Benny--no muss, no fuss. Instead, I found out I had to do the cleaning <i>myself</i>. I don't like to <i>sully</i> my hands, Benny--save for the one that I'll have <i>personally</i> for my <i>"nephew"</i>--otherwise, I have <i>others</i> who can do that for me--like <i>you</i>--or so I <i>thought</i>.</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Speechless, looks foolish:) B-but--</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Cuts him off:) --Shut up</i>. Clean up this mess, and get the <i>hell</i> out. Don't come back until I call you tomorrow. Good night. <i>(Leaves the living room with a still-stunned Benny on the floor looking after him)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to Darren's car, about 15 minutes later, somewhere inside of Colby county)</i></p>



     <p>Darren was driving his car down the highway from Lawndale, trying to look straight forward, with <i>Sandi Griffin</i> sitting beside him. He found himself stunned that Linda Griffin would <i>allow</i> her daughter out with her dressed like this--to kind of think of it, Sandi's mom was all <i>for</i> the "date"--even <i>encouraging</i> Sandi to stay out as <i>late</i> as she wanted with Darren, saying she <i>trusted</i> "Helen's Son" <i>implicitly</i> because of <i>Quinn</i> telling Sandi about his "gentlemanly manners"--<i>thank you, dear sis</i>. Sandi's father <i>Tom Griffin</i>, simply said <i>nothing</i> over this, watching Darren <i>sadly</i>--Darren drew the conclusion that he was being <i>intimidated</i> by his wife. Sandi's brothers--what were their names again? Oh yes--<i>Sam and Chris</i>--had <i>peppered</i> him with <i>"kissyface"</i> questions--pure <i>"hilarity"</i>, he had thought sarcastically. Darren guessed that this was Linda's way of getting <i>back</i> at Helen for the perceived "wrongdoing" against Sandi (he could tell the two did <i>not</i> like one another from the restaurant meeting), and he was caught in the <i>middle</i> of it, though Helen did <i>not</i> know that Linda was doing so, having thinking that Darren was out on a date with <i>Jane</i>. Helen would have probably <i>stopped</i> the "date" if she would have found out (something Darren would have jumped at if not doing this for Quinn) and that probably would <i>insure</i> that Quinn would be out of the Fashion Club, which in turn would <i>hurt</i> her chances of getting into the Fashion Institute.</p>

	<p>Darren was feeling <i>uncomfortable</i> because of what Sandi was <i>wearing</i>--a strapless off the shoulder red sequin dress with a <i>very</i> low-cut front, her cleavage pushed up most <i>profusely</i>--covered only just enough by a white flower corsage that Darren had purchased for her (by her <i>insistence</i> when she had called <i>back</i> the next day to add that one little item). She wore a white cotton shawl that draped her shoulders, and strapped red high-heeled shoes. Her hairstyle was different, done in a obviously fashionable style. (The same one as in the episode "Just Add Water") It was <i>beyond</i> clear that Sandi was <i>"dressed to kill"</i>--was she trying to close in on him <i>for</i> the "kill"? He <i>shuddered</i> at that thought, shaking his head quickly, and closing his eyes. He then repeated the chant he had going in his head to himself--<i>this was for Quinn--this was for Quinn, and Jane and Daria were following them--relax, relax</i>. He snapped out of his private thoughts when Sandi spoke.</p>


<p>SANDI: <i>(Looks over at him uneasily:)</i> Um, Darren?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Glances at her out of the corner of his eye:)</i> Yes, Sandi?</p>

<p>SANDI: Don't I, like, look <i>pretty</i> or something? You really haven't said a <i>word</i> to me since we left my house.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow, somewht suprised at Sandi's straightforwardness:)</i> Eh? Well, yes--yes, I suppose you <i>are</i>, Sandi. You look <i>very</i> pretty.</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Thank you, Darren.</p>

<p>DARREN: Mind answering a question?</p>

<p>SANDI: Like, sure, I suppose.</p>

<p>DARREN: Why <i>me</i>?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Narrows her eyes:)</i> What do you mean, Darren?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>Why</i> me? Sandi, with <i>your</i> looks, you could get <i>any</i> guy you wanted--</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Smugly:)</i> --That is <i>so</i> true--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sighs, rolls his eyes:) --Riiight</i>. So, why are you doing this? Why couldn't you have just punished Quinn some <i>other</i> way, not just by putting her on this <i>"fashion sabbatical"</i>? Something like a <i>suspension</i>--?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Now with a wicked smirk:)</i> Because I think that by going out with <i>you</i> is the <i>worse</i> thing I can <i>do</i> to Quinn--she'll be wondering <i>what</i> we're doing together. <i>(Darren frowns, and Sandi notices)</i> But, well, it isn't <i>just</i> that--you are kinda, uh, like <i>cute. (Looks away, flushed)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Slightly surprised by Sandi's comment:)</i> Uh, ah, thanks, I'm really flattered, but I--</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Rolls her eyes disdainfully:)</i> --Have a girlfriend <i>already, Joanne</i>, or something, right?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sounding a bit annoyed:)</i> It's <i>Jane</i>, Sandi, and yes, she is my girlfriend, and before you ask, I like her because she is a genuinely <i>decent</i> and <i>down-to-earth</i> person with a <i>twisted</i> sense of humor, which is actually something I find myself <i>attracted</i> to about her.</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(After a moment:)</i> I see. <i>(Pauses:)</i> You <i>can</i> do <i>so</i> much better, you know--no offense to Jo--uh, Jane. I can <i>offer</i> you <i>much</i> more than she can.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Having heard this before, gamely goes on:)</i> Oh, really--what can you offer me that she can't? <i>(Thought v.o.: Other than just pure <b>meanness</b>?)</i>

<p>SANDI: <i>(In an arrogant tone, put her hand on her chest:)</i> I do have the <i>looks</i>, the <i>charm</i>, and the ability to <i>manipulate</i> others to do my bidding for you. Does <i>Jane</i> have this?</p>


     <p>Inside his mind, Darren <i>fumed</i>. He had encountered this type of girl <i>several</i> times in the <i>country clubs</i> he and his (adopted) parents had frequented during some parties--which incidentally <i>bored</i> him to tears at times. These girls were <i>snobbish, rude, and arrogant,</i> talking all the time about their parent's <i>wealth</i> they were going to inherit, or <i>themselves</i>. It was not until <i>Stephanie</i> had Darren met a girl he <i>really</i> liked--her, and--<i>Jane</i>. It took all of his willpower not to simply <i>stop</i> the car, and toss Sandi <i>out</i> then and there. Instead, he gathered his words (and his temper), putting both under control, and spoke.</p>


<p>DARREN: Sandi, I like Jane--<i>period</i>. It's nothing <i>against</i> you, really. <i>(Sighs:)</i> Can't we talk about something <i>else</i> while on our way to this <i>Pastroni's</i>, please? <i>(Sandi shrugs, indifferent, while Darren ponders, then:)</i> How about what you're going to do <i>after</i> high school?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Startled a bit by Darren's question, cocks an eyebrow:)</i> Well, I'm er--um--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smirks slightly, cuts his eyes sideways at her:)</i> --Don't tell me you haven't <i>made</i> any plans as of yet?</p> 

<p>SANDI: <i>(Red-faced, indignant:)</i> I <i>do</i> have plans! I--just haven't <i>worked</i> them out yet.</p>

<p>DARREN: Well, I certainly <i>hope</i> you do soon. You <i>do</i> know Quinn aspires to go to the <i>Fashion Institute--</i>? She's been <i>preparing</i> to go there with my help, brushing up on her studies, and starting to take more <i>difficult</i> classes for her junior year in your high school.</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Snorts:)</i> Quinn wants to be a <i>"brain"</i> now like your <i>other</i> sister? Ha, that's <i>rich</i>! <i>(Darren cuts a slight scowl at Sandi)</i> Wait 'till I <i>tell</i> Stacy and Tiffany! They'll tell everyone <i>else</i>, and--</p> 

<p>DARREN: --Er, Sandi, this is the <i>Fashion</i> Institute--you know, what you're <i>supposed</i> to be an <i>expert</i> in? <i>(Pauses:)</i> Are you telling me that there's something <i>wrong</i> with being a <i>"brain"</i> when it comes to being knowledgeable about <i>fashion</i>?</p>


     <p>Sandi frowned at Darren, deep in thought, saying nothing for a long moment. Darren wondered if anything he said had <i>actually</i> gotten through this girl's brain. Sandi then spoke, talking in a low tone.</p>


<p>SANDI: Um, I've--uh, been thinking about my <i>future</i> since you asked me--I'll become a <i>model</i>, or something after high school.</p>

<p>DARREN: Sandi, I have to be <i>honest</i> with you--from what my (adopted) mother told me, it is <i>extremely</i> difficult to make it in the modeling business. I heard from Quinn that an <i>Amazon Modeling Agency</i> came by your school once to see if they could find the next "superstar" model, and I believe that <i>Kevin Thompson</i> guy was chosen--</p>

<p><i>(Note to reader: See "This Year's Model", of course)</i></p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(A bit angry:) --I</i> should have been the <i>one</i> to get that contract, not that <i>jock-boy</i>, Kevin! He didn't even finish it <i>out</i>, he was <i>soooo</i> pathetic an' everythin'--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smirks:)</i> --You know, that's almost the <i>same</i> thing <i>Quinn</i> told me. I guess you two kind of think on the <i>same</i> wavelength, eh? <i>(Sandi glares at Darren for a moment)</i> Look, if you pursue the world of fashion as an occupation, Sandi, then the <i>safest</i>, and eventually most <i>profitable</i> route is something like the courses the Fashion Institute offers, such as Fashion Design, Interior Design, perhaps something like Fashion Merchandise Marketing--</p>


     <p>Sandi, of course, was so <i>overwhelmed</i> by the courses Darren had filled her <i>(air)</i>head with, she closed her eyes and began to <i>shake</i> her head <i>violently</i>, unable to take anymore.</p> 


<p>SANDI: --<i>Daaaren</i>! Please! Like, can't we talk about the <i>date</i>? I mean, aren't we on <i>that</i>? People on dates talk about <i>looks</i> and <i>charm</i>, and--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gets a scheming look, thinks he's onto something, remembers the talk he had with Daria about the competitiveness between Quinn and Sandi:)</i> --It's <i>okay</i>, Sandi, we can talk about the "date" if you want--<i>(adds as an faux afterthought, shrugs:)</i> I understand if you believe you can't <i>compete</i> with Quinn in fashion--</p>


     <p><i>That</i> solicited the <i>exact</i> response Darren wanted.</p>


<p>SANDI: <i>(Enraged:)</i> --I can <i>too</i> compete with Quinn, and <i>then</i> some! <i>(Narrows her eyes:)</i> Tell me some <i>more</i> about those courses!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looking a little smug:)</i> As you <i>wish</i>--</p>


     <p>A little ways behind them, in Helen's SUV, Daria, who was driving, and Jane, who was in the passenger seat, were riding. Daria kept cutting her eyes over to her friend, <i>concerned</i>. Jane, her arms crossed, and glared forward, then spoke in an <i>irritated</i> voice.</p>


<p>JANE: Did you see <i>what</i> that little <i>tart</i> was <i>wearing</i>, Daria? <i>Did</i> you? I just <i>know</i> she's probably trying to <i>snuggle up</i> to Darren! The b--</p>

<p>DARIA: --<i>Down</i>, girl. <i>(Smirks:)</i> Darren's <i>car</i> hasn't <i>swerved</i> yet if she's tried that, so we're still in the <i>clear</i> about the <i>"snuggling"</i> thing.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Gives a really rare death glare at Daria:)</i> That's <i>not</i> funny, Daria. <i>(Sighs, then looks down, puts her hand on her forehead:)</i> Geez, why in the <i>hell</i> did I allow <i>this</i>? What was I <i>thinking</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Tries to look for words:)</i> Um, <i>sorry</i>--I was just trying to <i>lighten</i> the moment, Jane.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Now resuming her old, mischievous way, smirks:) You're</i> trying to <i>lighten</i> a moment, amiga--thought I'd <i>never</i> live to see the day.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks back:)</i> You're the <i>first</i> person to hear me <i>say</i> that--you might not live <i>long</i> enough <i>through</i> the day to <i>repeat</i> it to anyone else. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Seriously, Jane--we've gone <i>over</i> this at least a <i>dozen</i> times since we <i>left</i> Lawndale. Darren likes <i>you</i>, and <i>only</i> you. He's not--I repeat--<i>not</i> interested in Sandi Griffin--I really believe if Sandi Griffin was the <i>only</i> girl in the whole damn <i>universe</i>, he wouldn't be interested in her. Darren's <i>not</i> the type of guy who'd go for a girl like that--you <i>should</i> know that yourself. <i>(Adds:)</i> I think <i>I</i> can say that for sure.</p> 

<p>JANE: <i>(Smiles quietly:)</i> Yeah, yeah, you're <i>right</i>. I <i>shouldn't</i> be thinking like this. Darren--likes--<i>me. (Points to hereself:) Me</i>. Damn, I'm <i>lucky</i>. I'm the <i>envy</i> of a lot of girls. <i>(Smirks:) No</i> more feeling any <i>doubts</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: Okay, then. New subject?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Leans back in the seat:)</i> Yeah--go.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks at Jane, hesitates, then proceeds:)</i> Uh--<i>Trent</i>.</p>


     <p>Jane looked at Daria, surprised, wide-eyed, and feeling a bit <i>delighted</i>, began to <i>grin</i> slowly. Daria, of course, rolled her eyes.</p>


<p>JANE: Oh, <i>what</i>, my dear, dear, Daria, do you wish to ask about my bro?</p>

<p>DARIA: Get your dirty little <i>mind</i> out of the <i>gutter</i>, Lane. It <i>does</i> concern my <i>feelings</i> for Trent, but it's <i>not</i> what you think. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Trent's only--a <i>friend</i>. <i>(Pauses:) Nothing more, nothing less</i>. You can <i>stop</i> playing <i>yenta</i> now.</p>


<p><i>(Note to the readers, especially the "'shipper" ones: I suppose some of you will believe that I've fallen off my <b>"fence"</b> and are now into the <b>"anti-shipper"</b> camp--and I guess I can't blame you for getting that perception, though I'd <b>still</b> like to think of myself as a something of a "Fence-Sitter". I just believe like Michelle Klein-Hass, the TV show has made it seem that Daria and Trent are now just <b>friends</b>--at least after the third season finale, that "kiss" notwithstanding, and with what seems to be going on in the fourth season, and I'm going with that train of thought--for now.)</i></p>


    <p>Jane's smile slowly faded, then she looked away, and sighed. At least privately, she would not have to feel a little <i>guilty</i> anymore about being able to see Daria's brother while Daria and Trent did not do the same (or neither took the initiative) with each other, and feeling that she was "twisting that knife" into Daria's feeling's for Trent by being with Darren.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Well, it was worth a <i>try</i>. It would have been <i>great</i> to see you two with me and <i>your</i> bro. <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> You're <i>sure</i> about this?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:) Positive</i>. Trent and I have <i>different</i> priorities. <i>(Pauses:)</i> His newly-burgeoning music career might take him <i>places</i>--places that I see as <i>not</i> to where I want to go. I'm <i>99%</i> sure that I'm <i>over</i> Trent.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:) Only</i> 99%? Are you saying--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks back:)</i> --I'm saying that I'll <i>always</i> remember the <i>first</i> uh, um--<i>(turns red because she is telling Jane this for the first time, though Jane heard it first from Darren:)</i> crush</i> that I had was <i>Trent</i>, no matter <i>what</i> happens in the future to me.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Slowly nods in an understanding manner:)</i> And if my bro hits it <i>big</i> then--?</p>

<p>DARIA: Then I can say I <i>knew</i> the <i>"Great Rock Star Trent Lane".</i></p> 

<p>JANE: <i>(Raised eyebrows:)</i> That's <i>it</i>?</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Mona Lisa smile:)</i> Afraid so. <i>(Pauses, looks at Jane suspiciously:)</i> One question though--have you tried to get <i>Darren</i> to <i>help</i> you get Trent and me together?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Faux gasp and indignation:) Moi</i>? Do <i>that</i> to Darren? <i>How</i> could you <i>think</i> of something like that? Why, Daria, I'm <i>so</i> insulted!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> You <i>did</i>, didn't you?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Snorts:)</i> Yeah, I <i>tried</i>, but your bro didn't <i>bite</i>. He said that you and Quinn could decide on what to do with your <i>own</i> lives, or something to that effect. He said he'd be there for <i>"moral support". (Shrugs:)</i> Sheesh--the boy's got a <i>lot</i> to learn about being a sibling.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Really smirks:)</i> Ah, that's my <i>wise</i> bro. He's <i>everything</i> a sister could hope for in <i>having</i> one.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Stares insightfully at Daria for a moment:)</i> Daria, may I ask you a <i>personal</i> question about Darren?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(In a curious tone:)</i> Um, sure, Jane--what is it?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Quietly:)</i> Have you come to--well--<i>love</i> him as your brother? Like me and Trent?</p>


     <p>Daria looked at Jane wide-eyed for the slightest second, and struggled to say something, then saw Darren's car up ahead.</p>


<p>DARIA: Uh, Jane--look. Darren's car has turned into <i>Pastroni's</i>. We're here.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(After a moment:)</i> You're <i>not</i> gonna answer my question, are you?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Gives Jane her "expressionless expression", in a flat tone:)</i> What do <i>you</i> think, Jane? The answer should be <i>obvious. (Looks off to the side:)</i> Darren and Sandi are going into the swanky joint. Let's <i>join</i> them, shall we?</p>


     <p>Jane got out the the now-parked SUV and followed Daria into <i>Pastroni's</i> wordlessly. Behind <i>them</i>, the gray Camry rolled up, and parked in the far corner of the parking lot. The interior light came on, and the man inside started to write something down again, only occasionally looking up and around.</p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the front of the Suni Apartments, Los Angeles, the same time)</i></p>



     <p>Gerald Woo's car, with David and Leroy riding in tow behind him in their own car, came up and parked behind a white sportscar on the street. Just as they were going into the buliding, two men, a tall, thin, red-haired goateed man wearing dark sunglasses, and a short, stocky, brown-haired man with a thick beard, also wearing dark sunglasses, came out calmly by them, going to the sportscar, and getting in. Woo stopped for a moment, and looked at them just as he was about to go in. Leroy caught his gaze, while David continued into the building.</p>


<p>LEROY: <i>(Comes up beside Woo, looking in the same direction as well:)</i> Something up, Woo?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Still watches the men in the sportscar, which has started up, and is leaving slowly away:)</i> I don't know, Leroy--something seems--<i>familiar</i> about that red-haired man--<i>(narrows his eyes)</i> I--can't--place my <i>finger</i> on it, but--<i>(voice trails off, shakes his head:)</i> it can <i>wait</i>. Let's go inside. <i>(Leroy follows Woo into the building)</i></p>


     <p>Both men found David waiting at the scratched-up and cracked desk with a fat, bald-headed, sweaty-looking man in a tee-shirt, blue jeans, and sandals, holding the newspaper in one hand, and a beer in the other hand. He was smoking a cigar, and scowling. Leroy looked around, and saw that the walls and ceiling seemed to be ready to fall <i>apart</i> at any second. There were <i>cobwebs</i>  on the walls as well, and what appeared to be a rather thick coating of <i>dust</i> on the railing that led upstairs. The elevator beside it had an <i>"Out of Order"</i> sign on it--<i>why</i> did that not surprise him? The man then spoke.</p>


<p>MAN: <i>(In a heavy, gravelly voice:)</i> Yeah, what in the <i>hell</i> do you all want? A <i>room</i> to rent for a month, or somethin'?</p>

<p>DAVID: <i>(Leans over to Leroy in a low voice, sarcastic:)</i> What a <i>wonderful</i> welcome we've just received from this rather <i>"respectable-looking"</i> gentleman.</p>

<p>LEROY: <i>(Smirks, in the same voice:)</i> Yeah--it makes you want to get a room for a whole <i>year</i>. I wonder if they do <i>room service</i> here in this <i>"well-refined"</i> establishment?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Reaches into his coat pocket, pulls a picture of Sanchez out:)</i> We want no rooms, sir--rather, we're looking for this man--have you seen him? We were told he was <i>(looks around, slightly disgusted) "living"</i> here.</p>

<p>MAN: <i>(Narrows his eyes at the picture, ponders:) Hmmm</i>--yeah--yeah, that's <i>Gonzalez</i>. The damn <i>bastard</i> just <i>paid</i> me the rent he owed--took em' <i>long</i> enough. Said he was gonna hit the freakin' <i>jackpot</i>, or something. <i>(Pauses:)</i> You know, you're the <i>second</i> set of guys who've come to ask for him today. <i>(Woo looks back at David and Leroy, concerned:)</i> Those two guys that <i>just</i> went out past you, wanted to see him, <i>too</i>.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Alarmed, suddenly wide-eyed, realizes:) DAMN</i>! <i>(Grabs the man's shirt:)</i> Which room is <i>"Gonzalez"</i> in?</p>

<p>MAN: <i>(Startled:)</i> Hey, lemme go--</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Now furious, pulls the man to over the desk to him, face-to-face:) WHICH
--ROOM</i>?!</p>

<p>MAN: <i>(Terrified:) 3-3-308</i>! I-I-I've got the <i>key</i>! If ya want <i>money</i>, I ain't got much--</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Turns to David and Leroy:)</i> --Get up to that room--if I'm right, we're too <i>late</i>! <i>(David and Leroy rush up the stairs) You</i> come with us! <i>(Drags man up the stairs with him)</i></p>


     <p>It only took a minute to reach room 308, and when David and Leroy got there, the door was closed, but unlocked. They pushed the door open, and Woo's hunch was right--much to their <i>chagrin</i>. Woo, dragging the man with him, came in behind them and saw the <i>body</i> of "Gonzalez", A.K.A. Julio Sanchez, on the floor, partially hidden on the other side of his bed, with only his legs showing. Woo left the man, and brushed past Leroy and David, going on the other side of the bed to look closer, crouching down. The fat man timidly came up, and looked over the bed with a disgusted look on his face.</p>


<p>MAN: <i>(Gets wide-eyed:)</i> Aw, geez--is he--</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Looks up gravely at Leroy and David:)</i> --He's <i>dead</i>. A bullet to the <i>head</i>--probably a <i>silencer</i>, since no one in any of the other rooms heard anything. Judging from the position of the body, they did it the moment he turned his head <i>from</i> them, "execution-style".</p>

<p>DAVID: <i>(Almost speechless:)</i> How--how did they <i>know</i>--?</p> 

<p>LEROY: <i>(Slowly realizes, turns pale:)</i> That <i>red-haired</i> goateed man--</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Narrows his eyes at Leroy:)</i> The <i>pizza man</i>. He must've slipped a <i>bug</i> in the office when he came in--that's how they <i>knew</i> where to find Sanchez--we didn't bring any <i>attention</i> to ourselves when we were looking for him--</p>

<p>DAVID: <i>(Looks between the two, begins to realize:)</i> --Wait a second--you're saying--that--guy--<i>(grows angry:) DAMN IT</i>!</p>

<p>MAN: <i>(Puts his hand over his mouth:)</i> I--just--<i>had</i>--pizza--for--lunch--and--it's--comin'--<i>up--(vomits on the bed)</i></p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Through clenched teeth, rolls his eyes, frustrated and angry:) Wonderful</i>--just--wonderful. 
<i>(Thought v.o.: This <b>isn't</b> going to be good for Darren--<b>not</b> good at all...)</i></p>
