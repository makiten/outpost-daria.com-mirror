<p>Chapter 15 - Showdown!</p>



<p><i>(The scene is "Pastroni's", about 30 minutes later)</i></p>



     <p>The dinner with Sandi had actually gone quite well for Darren. He ordered a <i>$60</i> veal steak, while Sandi had ordered a <i>$75</i> salmon salad. He had gotten her to talk about going to the Fashion Institute, and not about <i>him</i>, which more than suited Darren, whose mind was still on <i>Sanchez</i>, and whether or not Woo had found anything. He chastized himself privately for <i>not</i> bringing his cell phone, fearing that any sudden "interrupting" calls would <i>anger</i> Sandi, and thusly put Quinn's chances at staying in the Fashion Club at risk. In the meantime, he tried to keep his attention on Sandi as she continued to drone on in her "Valley-girl" voice.</p>


<p>SANDI: --And like, I think I can be <i>sooo</i> much better than Quinn in the Fashion Designer field. <i>(Takes a nibble from her salad)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shrugs while cutting into his steak:)</i> I suppose. You'll have to bone up on your English, computer, math, public speaking, and drafting in high school to get better grades if you want the Associate of Arts degree. Did you know you need at least a <i>"B"</i> average to get in?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Turns pale:)</i> A <i>"B"</i> average? Quinn told the Fashion Club that you could get her into Circa as an intern, but she didn't say <i>anything</i> about the <i>grades</i> to get into the Fashion Institute! That is like, <i>sooo</i> hard!</p>

<p>DARREN: But <i>true</i>, I'm afraid. <i>(Eats)</i></p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Hesitates:)</i> Um, look, Darren--speaking of Circa, Quinn showed us the <i>dress</i> you bought her. It was a <i>"Circa Original"</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: Ah, yes--I remember. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Your point <i>being</i>--?</p>

<p>SANDI: Well, like--it's <i>expensive</i>, right? <i>(Adds after a moment:)</i> Do you have a <i>lot</i> of <i>money</i>, or something? <i>(Darren looks slightly alarmed)</i> I, of course have been to <i>Cashman's</i> many times, and I know for a <i>fact</i> that the dress Quinn had was worth about <i>$800</i>.

<p>DARREN: <i>(Quickly covers himself:)</i> Oh, uh, well--my (adopted) parents left me <i>some</i> money, and I used some of it to buy Quinn that dress.</p> 

<p>SANDI: <i>(Not backing off:)</i> But that was an <i>$800</i> dress! Are you like, a <i>millionaire</i>, or something? How could you <i>afford</i> that?</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(After a moment:)</i> Sandi, I used a <i>little</i> bit of my money to buy Quinn a--<i>birthday</i> gift. So it cost $800. So <i>what</i>? Here, I'm spending a <i>lot</i> of money on <i>you</i> on this <i>"date"</i>.</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Smirks:)</i> That's <i>exactly</i> my point. I <i>suspected</i> that you had money when Quinn told us that you brought her that dress, so that's why I wanted you to take me <i>here</i>, and find out if you could afford this, which <i>obviously</i> you could--an' you also offered to give the Fashion Club some <i>money</i> to keep Quinn in. <i>(Narrows her eyes:)</i> How much money <i>do</i> you have, Darren?</p>


     <p>Darren looked at Sandi, slightly caught off-guard. This girl <i>had</i> caught on that he seemed to have a lot of money, and wanted to know the amount. He thought about it for a second, then, rapidly formulating a plan in his mind, suddenly <i>chuckled</i> to himself, which Sandi picked up on, then frowned out of perplexity.</p>


<p>SANDI: <i>(Arched eyebrow:)</i> Like, did I say something <i>funny</i>, or something, Darren?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Now in a serious tone, the smile gone from his face:)</i> That <i>depends. (Pauses, narrows his eyes:)</i> Why would you <i>care</i> about how much money I have? Is that what this is <i>really</i> all about?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Wide-eyed, speechless, now caught off-guard herself:)</i> Like, <i>no</i>! I, uh, was just <i>curious</i>, that's all! <i>(Hesitates, then adds hastily:)</i> If you don't want to say anything about how much you have, um, you <i>don't</i> have to!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(After eying her over quickly, then satisfied that she seems serious, adds with a ever-so-slight hint of sarcasm:) Good</i>--after all, I wouldn't want to get the <i>wrong</i> idea about your--<i>"real"</i> intentions, now, would I? <i>(Pauses, then talks with an air of nonchalance:)</i> How's your salmon salad?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Looks down at her salad, sheepishly for her:)</i> It's like, uh
--<i>delicious</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(With the same tone of voice:) Good. (Resumes eating)</i></p>


    <p>Both continued their meal in silence, with Darren secretly <i>relieved</i> about Sandi not delving in any further about his money.</p>

     <p>In the meantime, at another table across the dimmed restaurant, just about out of sight of Darren and Sandi (but enough for both Darren and Sandi to be seen by <i>them</i>), Daria and Jane sat at a candlelight table in their regular clothing eating amidst some curious stares from the well-dressed patrons. Both girls occasionally gave their own <i>"intimidating"</i> stares right back, which usually would more than cause the <i>"well-heeled"</i> diners to turn away in fear, and back to their own meals <i>(and business)</i>. Both girls had ordered a <i>$30 cheeseburger plate</i> that consisted of onion rings, soda, and fries (usually the plate reserved for <i>kids</i>), which drew an <i>exasperated</i> sigh from the waiter of their table, who had already <i>dreaded</i> serving such <i>"common-looking"</i> people in the first place. Daria, picking up on the waiter's indifference, smirked, and promptly pulled out and waved a <i>$50</i> bill from the front of her jacket, and pretended to talk to Jane in a deadpan <i>"snooty"</i> voice about the <i>"wonderful"</i> service she <i>"expected"</i> from the <i>"servants"</i> of this <i>"fine establishment"</i> (much to Jane's amusement), and the <i>big</i> tips she usually gave when she came in--of course, this was the <i>first</i> time she was in here--and if Daria would have her way, the <i>last</i> time ever. The waiter's attitude then suddenly <i>changed</i> when he caught sight of the bill, and he was only <i>too</i> glad to serve them, coming up almost every <i>ten</i> minutes to ask if either girl wanted anything, or to inquire if everything was all right while he was constantly filling their glasses with soda. Jane would usually answer with an <i>"a-okay"</i> sign with her hands, (Daria with a slight, affimative nod) and the waiter would eagerly smile, relieved. Both were still eating their burgers when Daria spoke.</p>


<p>DARIA: How's your cheeseburger?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(With her mouth full:)</i> Eh--it's okay, but it <i>still</i> doesn't beat <i>Cluster Burger</i>, or even the <i>Zen's</i>, for that matter. The onion rings taste like a <i>"rubbery salty tire"</i>.</p> 

<p>DARIA: Yeah--I think the meat's too damn <i>dry</i> or something. The <i>spit</i> in my mouth is <i>struggling</i> to keep the food <i>moist</i>. I have to keep drinking the soda to <i>"back up"</i> my saliva. <i>(Drinks soda:)</i> Maybe <i>that's</i> why <i>"Jovo"</i> here keeps coming around with his pitcherful of soda to pour--he <i>knows</i> about the <i>crappy</i> food they serve. <i>Hell</i> of a way to <i>waste</i> almost <i>$70</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Drinks her soda as well:)</i> Yeah. <i>(Pauses:)</i> By the way, are you <i>really</i> gonna give that poor <i>sap</i> of a waiter a <i>big</i> tip?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> If he keeps kissing our <i>asses</i>, I'm <i>thinking</i> about leaving him a <i>$1</i> tip for all of his <i>"hard"</i> work--I <i>still</i> can't get over that <i>"look-down-my-nose-at-you-two" sneer</i> from him when he first laid his eyes on us, you know. <i>(Bites into burger some more)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:)</i> My, but you're the <i>big</i> tipper, girl. <i>(Sneaks a glance at Darren and Sandi's table:)</i> Everything seems to be on the up and up over at <i>"Table Ground Zero".</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks in the same direction:)</i> Yeah--Sandi seems to be <i>behaving</i> herself--for the <i>moment</i>, anyway.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(With a bit of irritation in her voice, which Daria picks up on:)</i> And hopefully, she'll <i>keep</i> it that way. <i>(Lightens up her tone:)</i> So, how <i>much</i> did Darren give you again?</p>

<p>DARIA: About <i>$500</i> for gas and this, which should leave us with <i>plenty</i> left--no need to worry about <i>washing</i> the dishes if we come up short.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Snorts:)</i> Not that we <i>would</i>, anyway--the <i>dishes</i>, that is. <i>(Pauses, frowns slightly, perplexed:) Geez</i>--Darren's really <i>shelling</i> the <i>"moolah"</i> out, isn't he?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Ponders:)</i> Uh-huh--and I've been <i>wondering</i> about that. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Before I left to pick you up, I sneaked a quick <i>peek</i> into Quinn's room after she left for Stacy's--Darren was getting ready in the bathroom while I did this, mind you--I was still kind of <i>worried</i> about my bro's ability to pay for <i>"Miss Congeniality"</i>, himself, and you and me for tonight, <i>despite</i> his assurances. I took a <i>real</i> close look at the dress Quinn <i>conned</i> Darren to get her from <i>Cashman's</i> in her closet--</p>

<p>JANE: --The <i>gold</i> one where Darren was <i>coy</i> in not telling us how much he <i>paid</i> for to get Quinn? <i>(Smirks:)</i> Wished you had one <i>like</i> it, eh?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> Actually, I was studying it to see if it could fit <i>you</i> so I could <i>bury</i> you in it after I <i>kill</i> you, that <i>bridemaid's</i> dress from my cousin Erin's wedding notwithstanding. <i>(Jane chuckles)</i> Anyway, I looked at the clothes tag on the collar, and saw it was something called a <i>"Circa Original"</i> --ironically the <i>same</i> company Darren's late adopted mom worked at. Anyway, I was able to make a quiet call to <i>Cashman's</i> out of <i>curiousity</i>, and I found out something <i>very</i> interesting--</p>


<p><i>(Note to reader: The bridesmaid's dress that Daria wore was a "Running Gag" in the episode "I Don't", of course)</i></p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Grins:)</i> --You found out they had one in your <i>size</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Narrows her eyes:)</i> How about if I just <i>get up</i> from here, pay <i>my</i> tab, and <i>leave</i> you twisting in the wind, my fellow <i>deviant</i>? <i>(Smirks:)</i> Remember, <i>I</i> have the money <i>and</i> the car.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Faux pleads, laughs:)</i> Okay, okay! No more <i>snide</i> remarks--<i>(smirks wickedly:)</i> at least on <i>this</i> subject, anyway. Seriously, what'd you find out, amiga?</p>

<p>DARIA: That the dress cost <i>$800. (Jane cocks an eyebrow, surprised, whistles to herself)</i> I think I can safely say that my <i>doubts</i> about Big Bro's possible money problems for tonight have gone <i>out</i> the window. My guess is that his adopted parents left him with a <i>sizable</i> amount of money when they died.</p>


     <p>Jane looked away for a moment, deep in thought, then spoke.</p>


<p>JANE: You know, I just thought about something myself, Daria, especially after your little <i>"tip quip"</i> about our <i>kiss-ass</i> waiter--do you remember when Darren called you from <i>Do Me A Donut</i> that morning when he and I first ran into each other following what happened at the <i>Zen</i> the previous night when I--well--<i>kissed</i> him? <i>(Daria frowns, tries to remember)</i> He told you we had breakfast? <i>(Daria then slowly nods, now remembers)</i> Well, while he went to call you after we finished eating, I noticed that he left a <i>hell</i> of a large tip--<i>$20</i>--on the table. <i>(Daria cocks an eyebrow)</i> I pointed it out to him, and he seemed to be <i>shocked</i> when he saw what he tipped, and replaced it with $5. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I didn't think much of it at the time, but do you think he <i>meant</i> to do that, and then took it <i>back</i> when I pointed it out, so he could <i>(hesitates:) cover</i> himself?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(After a second:)</i> Hmmm--<i>why</i> would he do that? You don't think he has something to <i>hide</i> concerning the <i>money</i> he has, do you? That wouldn't make any <i>sense</i>. I mean, I don't really give a <i>damn</i> about my bro's money, just--<i>(catches herself)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:)</i> --Just about <i>him</i>, right? <i>(Daria glares at her slightly)</i> Well, neither do <i>I</i>, for the record, pard. <i>(Pauses:)</i> The other night while we were going out to the movie, he tried to buy me--<i>(pauses:)</i> a bouquet of <i>roses. (Daria begins to smirk wickedly)</i> Shut up, don't say a <i>damn</i> thing, you--anyway, it was a <i>sweet</i> gesture, but I said <i>no</i>. Did you know those flowers cost <i>$50</i> a dozen?</p>

<p>DARIA: Whoa. <i>(Gets in a low voice:)</i> You didn't take <i>one</i> rose at <i>all</i>?</p>


     <p>Jane looked away, red-faced. Daria carefully looked over her friend's reaction, then slowly began to give her Mona Lisa smile, which made Jane <i>frown</i>.</p>


<p>JANE: Okay! I let him buy me <i>one</i> rose! <i>(Adds quickly:)</i> I didn't want him to go to all that trouble of spending a whole lot of money on <i>me</i>, all right?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Enjoys this:) Awwww</i>--how <i>romantic--one</i> rose. <i>(Wiggles her eyebrows up and down in a suggestive way:)</i> Did he whisper <i>sweet nothings</i> in your ear, too?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Glares:) ANY</i>way, my <i>point</i> is, is that he was willing to spend <i>that</i> much money on me, capeesh? I now agree with you that's he's <i>got</i> to have a <i>sizable</i> amount of money--<i>(pauses:)</i> now that I think about it even <i>more</i>, I can't recall a time that he <i>didn't</i> pay for <i>everything</i> for us since I've come back here from vacation with my mom. I mean with the <i>pizza</i>, the <i>arcade tokens</i>, the <i>movies, this--</i></p>


     <p>Daria looked into space for a moment, frowning, then gave Jane a look that seemed to say, <i>"Is <b>that</b> it?"</i>, a look that Jane picked up on immediately.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Sounding eager, slowly twirls her hand to will out the answer from Daria:) Sooo</i>--?</p>

<p>DARIA: The <i>Appletons</i>, Jane--somehow or another, their <i>deaths</i> have something to do with Darren having <i>money. (Jane ponders this)</i> Hmmm--Darren said his adopted mom worked for Circa clothing, which we've since found out is <i>part</i> of Appleton Industries, right? <i>(Jane nods)</i> He said his adopted dad worked in <i>computers</i>, and Appleton has a computer <i>division</i>--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Cuts her off:)</i> --Daria, are you saying that <i>both</i> of Darren's adopted parents <i>worked</i> for Appleton Industries, and that somehow or another they were <i>beneficiaries</i> when those <i>filthy-rich</i> "Appleton" people died?</p>

<p>DARIA: It makes <i>sense</i> when you think about it, Jane. The question we know is--<i>how</i> did Darren's adopted parents die? They weren't <i>in</i> the same crash as that "Arthur Jr." guy's parents unless--unless--<i>(slowly gets a look of realization on her face:) no</i>--that's <i>nuts--(looks at Jane uneasily:) isn't</i> it?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Hangs on Daria's every word:) What? What?</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Tries to convey her words:)</i> That--that--those--those--"Appleton" people who died in that jet plane crash <i>were</i> Darren's adopted parents? <i>(Jane stares at Daria, stunned, her mouth agape)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the Suni Apartments, the hallway outside of Sanchez's room, about the same time)</i></p>



     <p>The body of the late Julio Sanchez, now covered in a bodybag and on a stretcher, was being rolled out of his room. Meanwhile, Leroy, David and the fat man were leaning on the cracked plaster wall talking to a police officer in the hallway when the body rolled by. The fat man took a glance at it, and promptly began to vomit <i>again</i>, this time on the <i>floor</i>. David, Leroy, and the officer looked at the fat man, rolled their eyes, <i>disgusted</i>, and shook their heads slowly. Several people down the hallway who were held back by another officer, presumably the other tenants, turned their heads away in disgust, more by the fat man's display of <i>"tact"</i> (or lack of it), rather than by the sight of the body, for they had seen <i>many</i> bodybags on stretchers <i>before</i> in this run-down <i>hellhole</i> of a building, some from <i>drug overdoses</i>, some from <i>murder</i>. The custodian, an old man in a tanktop and baggy beige pants, and who had cleaned the bedsheet that the fat man had vomited on earlier upon seeing Sahchez's dead body, was allowed to come up and clean the contents. He glared at the fat man while sprinkling some powder on the vomit, and spoke.</p>


<p>CUSTODIAN: This is absolutely the very <i>last</i> damn time that I'll do this, you lousy, cheap-paying, fat <i>slob</i>! Have you got <i>no</i> stomach, or something? <i>(The fat man glares back briefly at the custodian while wiping his mouth, embarassed, while Leroy, David, and the cop chuckle quietly)</i></p>


     <p>Meanwhile, Gerald Woo sat in a chair in the middle of Sanchez's room, rolling his eyes, while a scruffy-looking, black and grey-haired short man in a ruffled black suit, presumably a police detective, stood in front of him, writing on a notepad, while a poilce photographer was nearby, taking pictures of the apartment, now a crime scene. The detective then spoke in an annoyed, <i>angry</i> tone.</p>


<p>DETECTIVE: <i>(Frowns:) Damn it</i>, Woo! Why in the <i>hell</i> didn't you tell <i>us</i> when you found out that Sanchez wasn't everything he <i>seemed</i> to be after you discovered he worked on that fuel line on the Appleton's plane at LAX? <i>We</i> could've hauled his <i>ass</i> into the damn station, and found out <i>who</i> hired him!</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Through clenched teeth:)</i> I <i>told</i> you, <i>Lt. Keller</i>, I had only <i>circumstantial</i> evidence! That's why <i>I</i> wanted to find Sanchez, and get him to tell us who hired him! Don't you realize that if you had put out a <i>full-scale</i> manhunt on Sanchez, that it would've <i>alerted</i> whoever hired him to <i>silence</i> Sanchez--</p>

<p>LT. KELLER: <i>(Cuts Woo off, his voice even louder:)</i> --Which happened <i>ANYWAY</i>! It didn't make a <i>damn</i> bit of difference, Woo!</p> 

<p>WOO: <i>(<b>His</b> voice becoming louder, which is rare for him:)</i> Only because they <i>sneaked</i> an electronic <i>bug</i> into my office, which I obviously didn't know about, and found out where Sanchez was! <i>(Adds:)</i> I called my secretary <i>Carla</i> to look for it and any <i>others</i> while you guys were coming over here, and she <i>found</i> only one under the front lip of her desk--</p>

<p>LT. KELLER: <i>(Still loud:)</i> --And that doesn't do us a whole damn lot of good <i>now</i>, does it?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Ditto:)</i> You can check it for <i>fingerprints</i>!</p>

<p>LT. KELLER: <i>(Glares:)</i> Oh, we'll do <i>that</i>, don't you worry--not that I suspect that <i>that</i> will do any good, either! <i>(Pauses, looks down at his notepad:)</i> We have an <i>A.P.B.</i> out on the suspects that you, your men, and <i>fat-nasty</i> out there described, as well as the sportscar they were in, with the license number <i>"TAFKA". (Looks up, narrows his eyes:) Who's</i> your <i>client</i>, Woo?</p>


<p><i>(Note to reader: "A.P.B." means "All points bulletin"--duh!)</i></p>


     <p>Woo took a deep breath, then spoke.</p>


<p>WOO: I'd--rather <i>not</i> divulge that information right now, Lt. Keller
--only to say that my client is--<i>associated</i> with Appleton Industries. <i>(Lt. Keller frowns)</i></p> 

<p>LT. KELLER: "Associated", huh? May I ask <i>why</i> you don't want to tell me, Woo?</p>

<p>WOO: On the <i>simple</i> fact that my client's <i>life</i> could be in <i>danger</i> if I do.</p> 

<p>LT. KELLER: In <i>danger</i>, eh? Are you saying that this <i>"client"</i> of yours is <i>working</i> at Appleton right now?</p>

<p>WOO: Actually, <i>no</i>, but still, I think it's best if he or she stays in the <i>background</i>, for now.</p>

<p>LT. KELLER: <i>(Ponders:) Uh-huh. Background</i>, you say. <i>(Adds with a bit of a sneer in his tone of voice:)</i> Well, <i>I'm</i> wondering if you think that whoever hired Sanchez might go <i>after</i> your client, since he or she was the one that hired you to find Sanchez and expose <i>them</i>? You were <i>bugged</i>, remember? Is it possible you or your men might've <i>leaked</i> something that whoever hired Sanchez overheard, and that could possibly <i>threaten</i> your client?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(After a moment:)</i> I--don't <i>think</i> so.</p> 

<p>LT. KELLER: <i>(Snorts:)</i> Yeah--<i>right. We</i> could <i>protect</i> your client, you know.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> From <i>what</i>, Lt. Keller? Do you <i>honestly</i> think that whoever did this would go <i>after</i> my client if they <i>knew</i> the police or even the <i>F.B.I.</i> were protecting him or her? No, my client's <i>safe</i> where they are, and even if they <i>took</i> the protection you offered, they could feel like they were in a <i>bubble</i>, possibly for the <i>rest</i> of their lives, looking <i>constantly</i> over their <i>shoulder. (Pauses, thinks a second more:) Forget</i> it.</p>

<p>LT. KELLER: <i>(After staring at Woo for a long moment:)</i> Is that your <i>final</i> answer?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Is this <i>"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"</i>, now? <i>(Lt. Keller gives Woo a warning look)</i> Sorry. Look, it's possible now that whoever did this might <i>not</i> go after my client since Sanchez, the <i>one</i> obstacle who could've <i>exposed</i> them, is dead.</p> 

<p>LT. KELLER: <i>(Gives Woo a look of doubt:)</i> Do you <i>really</i> believe that?</p>


     <p>Woo slowly looked at Lt. Keller, deep in thought, then spoke.</p>


<p>WOO: <i>(Sighs:)</i> I don't know <i>what</i> to believe. <i>(Pauses:)</i> All I know is, is that I <i>failed</i> my client, and I <i>don't</i> like having that feeling.</p> 

<p>LT. KELLER: <i>Who</i> does? What do you have to <i>lose</i>, Woo? Tell us who he or she is, so we can <i>protect</i> them.</p>

<p>WOO: It's <i>not</i> that simple, Lt. Keller. You see, my client is staying with their <i>birth family</i>, a family that is laying their eyes on my client for the <i>first</i> time ever, due to a rather <i>tragic</i> set of circumstances. In fact, my client's birth family <i>doesn't</i> know <i>who</i> my client <i>really</i> is. If I tell you who it is, <i>they'd</i> know, too, and it could create a bit of a--<i>messy</i> situation, what, with all of the <i>questions</i> that would be asked by them, and such, not to mention that my client's birth family could be put in danger <i>themselves</i>.</p>

<p>LT. KELLER: Hm. That <i>does</i> rather <i>complicate</i> things, doesn't it? <i>(Adds:)</i> You <i>do</i> realize that I could get a <i>court order</i> and <i>force</i> you or your men to disclose who your client is?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(In a cool tone, leans back in the chair:)</i> Of course--the choice is yours--<i>if</i> I or my men <i>cooperate</i>, that is. <i>(Smirks smugly)</i></p>


     <p>Woo's tone <i>frustrated</i> Lt. Keller, having heard this <i>before</i>.</p>


<p>LT. KELLER: You and your men <i>aren't</i> going to cooperate, are you? <i>(Woo slowly shakes his head no, then Lt. Keller adds:)</i> Are you willing to risk <i>jail</i> time to prove your freaking <i>point</i>? <i>(Woo slowly nods his head yes)</i> Woo, we've known each other for how long--<i>15</i> years, now?</p>

<p>WOO: Just about--and this means--<i>what</i>?</p>

<p>LT. KELLER: <i>(Glares, sighs:)</i> It means I'm <i>wasting</i> my time, having seen you do something like this on <i>several</i> occasions <i>before</i> for your clients. <i>(Through clenched teeth:) Go</i>, get the <i>hell</i> out, Woo. <i>(Woo gets up and starts to leave)</i> Oh, and by the way--<i>(Woo stops, then turns to Lt. Keller, who gives Woo a warning look:)</i> your <i>ass</i> is <i>grass</i> if your client <i>dies</i>, got that? <i>(Gets into Woo's face:)</i> I'll come down so <i>hard</i> on you, you'll wish that you had <i>never</i> even became a detective, that you never even came into this <i>city</i>, that you were never even <i>BORN</i>!</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Cooly, smirks, looks up:)</i> Let's see--that's now a <i>hundred</i> times you've given me this <i>threat</i>, right? <i>(Lt. Keller turns red with rage)</i> I'm <i>still</i> here--<i>(looks Lt. Keller in the eye, now in a serious tone:)</i> and my <i>client</i> will be too--<i>count</i> on it. <i>(Leaves the room)</i></p>


     <p>Woo walked out of the apartments with Leroy and David, while several TV reporters and cameras tried to go past them into the apartments, and promptly got into an argument with two officers who were trying to keep them out. Woo made a quick motion with his head, and both men gathered with him in front of his car.</p> 


<p>WOO: <i>(In a low voice:)</i> You know the <i>drill</i>--Keller will send some men to <i>follow</i> us so he can try and locate our client. <i>(Leroy and David give curt nods)</i> Of course, he doesn't know that our client is on the <i>other</i> side of the country, so we're <i>okay</i> for now. Go straight to your homes, gentlemen, and rest. We'll meet at the office at <i>7:00 a.m.</i> tomorrow morning--following <i>another</i> bug sweep of the office, of course.</p>

<p>DAVID: <i>(In the same tone:)</i> Woo, what do we do about <i>Darren Appleton</i>?</p> 

<p>WOO: <i>(Sighs, shrugs, starts to sound depressed:)</i> I'll have to inform him that Sanchez is <i>dead</i>, and we'll have to figure out our <i>next</i> move. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I'm willing to guess that this whole thing is <i>not</i> over yet.</p> 

<p>LEROY: Do you think <i>Darren's</i> going to be the <i>next</i> target, Woo?</p> 

<p>WOO: I'm almost <i>sure</i> of it for some reason, Leroy, though I don't know <i>when</i> they'll go after him. I'm working on a small <i>hunch</i> in my mind, but it's going to have to wait for the time being. <i>(Bites his lower lip, looks around after a long moment:)</i> For the moment, I'm trying to figure out <i>how</i> to break the news to Darren--<i>(gets a pained look on his face, voice goes down to a whisper:)</i> this is the most <i>difficult</i> thing I've <i>ever</i> had to do--something like this has <i>never</i> happened before. Damn it, we were <i>used</i> to find someone so they could be <i>killed</i>! <i>(Frowns:) Used</i>--and you <i>know</i> how much I <i>hate</i> that! We must look like <i>fools</i>! <i>(Pauses, narrows his eyes:)</i> No, scratch that--<i>I</i> must look like a fool!</p> 

<p>DAVID: <i>(In a soothing tone:)</i> Woo, we <i>didn't</i> know--</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Now enraged, cuts him off:)</i> --BUT WE <i>SHOULD</i> HAVE KNOWN, DAVID! THERE WAS NO EXCUSE! <i>(David and Leroy are taken aback by Woo's tone, and the reporters and officer stop their argument and look at Woo, startled) (Woo goes into a whisper again:) I</i> should have known. Now, we might <i>not</i> catch whoever did this, and it's all <i>my</i> fault. All of that searching and hard work, gone up in <i>smoke. (Suddenly brushes past Leroy and David, gets into his car, and starts it up)</i></p>

<p>LEROY: <i>(Goes up to driver's side window:)</i> Woo! Hey, man--</p>


     <p>Woo simply stared forward for a moment, then slowly looked at Leroy. To Leroy, it was a look of <i>defeat</i>, a look of <i>wariness</i>, a <i>cold</i> look, one devoid of <i>any</i> feeling.</p> 
 

<p>WOO: <i>Tomorrow.</i> 7:00 a.m. Remember. <i>(Suddenly takes off, and Leroy jumps back, just barely)</i></p>


     <p>A female reporter holding a microphone came up to both shocked men, followed by a cameraman, who was filming them.</p>


<p>REPORTER: <i>(Smirks, shoves the microphone in David's face:)</i> I <i>thought</i> I recognized that man! That's the detective <i>Gerald Woo</i>, isn't it? You two <i>work</i> for him, don't you? <i>(Realizes:)</i> Say, you came out of the Suni Apartments, right? What <i>happened</i> in there? We heard someone was <i>murdered</i>!</p>


     <p>David and Leroy simply looked at each other expressionessly and got into David's car. The reporter followed David as he got into the driver's seat.</p>


<p>REPORTER: <i>(Annoyed:)</i> Hey, all I'm asking is a <i>question</i>, here!</p>

<p>DAVID: <i>(Starts his car up, glares at the reporter:)</i> And I'll give you an <i>answer</i> here--take a <i>hike, Lois Lane</i>! <i>(Speeds off, leaves the reporter and the cameraman in a cloud of smoke, coughing)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene is now in Helen's SUV, on a highway, about 30 minutes later)</i></p>



     <p>Daria and Jane were following Darren and Sandi again, this time going to <i>The Haven</i> nightclub. Nothing more was said between Daria and Jane concerning Daria's startling <i>revelation</i> that Darren <i>had</i> to be the adopted son of the deceased Appletons during dinner--in fact, nothing else was said <i>at all</i> while the girls finished their food, occasionally looking over at the table where Darren and Sandi were, privately wondering amongst themselves about Darren. True to her word, Daria left <i>$1</i> as a tip for the waiter, and a <i>written</i> tip on a napkin beneath the dollar--<i>"Improve your damn <b>attitude</b> sir, and you can improve your damn <b>lot</b> in life--hell, anything's possible"</i>. The two girls now sat in the SUV in an uneasy silence. Jane then broke it, cutting her eyes over at Daria.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Hesitant:)</i> Um--Daria?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Ditto:)</i> Er, what, Jane?</p>

<p>JANE: Ah, <i>why</i> didn't we kinda just <i>ask</i> Darren if he's that "Arthur Appleton Jr." guy? <i>(Adds:)</i> I thought <i>you</i> would've gotten up and went <i>over</i> to their table, and you know--?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:) Funny</i>--I was thinking the <i>same</i> thing about <i>you. (Sighs:) Two</i> reasons I didn't, Jane--(1) he's with <i>Sandi</i>--if we <i>confronted</i> him, it could <i>mess up</i> Quinn's standing in the Fashion Club if she <i>saw</i> us, and (2) I want to be <i>absolutely</i> sure he is <i>the</i> mysterious "Arthur Appleton Jr.". <i>(Pauses:)</i> If you're game, I'd like to <i>check</i> on a few things tomorrow, okay? We don't want to be <i>wrong</i> about this, and I'd rather we'd want to have <i>overwhelming</i> evidence on our side.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Grows quiet:)</i> Yeah, yeah, you're right--good idea. Geez--he's <i>gotta</i> have a <i>good</i> reason if he's that "Appleton" guy, right?</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks distant:)</i> I--guess. I should have <i>detected</i> all of the <i>clues</i> he was <i>inadvertently</i> giving me, with all of the <i>hesitation</i> in trying to tell me the <i>truth</i>, his wanting me to <i>"overlook"</i> certain things, and it's--that--well--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:) --Gooo ooon--</i></p>

<p>DARIA: --If he's been--<i>misleading</i> us--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> --Oh, now, you're being <i>coy</i>, Daria--you <i>really</i> want to say <i>"lying, to us"--(Daria glares at Jane)</i> but I'm willing to listen, <i>anyway</i>--</p>

<p>DARIA: --<i>IF</i> he's been <i>misleading</i> us, then I wonder if he's been misleading us about what happened with his fiancee Stephanie Reardon, and well--<i>(in a very low voice:)</i> whether or not he's really <i>proud</i> that I'm--his <i>sister</i>.</p>


     <p>Jane looked at Daria, stunned at her remark, actually more by Daria's <i>candor</i> than by Daria's wondering about Darren's brotherly pride over his sister or about Darren's late fiancee. Daria had always been a <i>master</i> at hiding her feelings, though Jane could ever-so-slightly see the subtle <i>twitches</i> in her best friend's facial and vocal features whenever Daria would convey her opinion about something. Here, it was a feeling of <i>disappointment</i>, of being let <i>down</i> a little by her brother. Whatever the case, Jane, privately believing in Darren's reasons in possibly pretending he was someone else for her <i>own</i> reasons, had to <i>stop</i> her friend's slowly forming <i>doubts</i>, or risking seeing Daria's cynical nature, which had actually gone <i>down</i> some, thanks to Darren's presence, come back with a <i>vengeance</i>. Quietly, but confidently, Jane spoke.</p>


<p>JANE: Look, Daria--I don't know <i>what</i> to think about why or if Darren has done what he's done. I do believe that he <i>is</i> telling us the <i>truth</i> about Stephanie Reardon--there's really <i>no</i> reason he'd <i>lie</i> about something like that. And girl, there's no way in <i>hell</i> that I can believe he <i>lied</i> to you about his being proud that you're his sister. He <i>beamed</i> with <i>pride</i> when he talked about you to me, the <i>same</i> for Quinn, though he seemed even more enthusiastic about <i>you</i> and your writing. Remember, he told the Fashion Club
--the <i>Fashion Club</i>, mind you--that Quinn was his <i>cousin</i>, and <i>not</i> you--that in <i>itself</i> was <i>proof</i> enough for <i>me</i>.</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sighs:)</i> I--suppose, Jane--<i>(pauses:)</i> you--you're not <i>angry</i> over Darren and what he's possibly done, are you?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(After a moment of silence, in a quiet tone:)</i> Daria--he saved my <i>life. How</i> could I get <i>"angry"</i> over someone who did <i>that</i>? I'm kind of <i>confused</i> over what he did, IF he did it, yeah--but I <i>like</i> him--<i>period</i>. He's a <i>great</i> guy. <i>(The corner of Daria's mouth turns up ever-so-slightly)</i> Like I said, he's gotta have a <i>good</i> reason if he <i>pretended</i> to be someone else. We'll just find out once and for all tomorrow, <i>(adds, looks determined:)</i> and even if he <i>is</i> this "Arthur Appleton Jr.", well, it's not gonna change a <i>damn</i> thing for me, and how I'm starting to <i>feel</i> about him. <i>(Daria cocks an eyebrow, then Jane sighs)</i> Sorry--I guess liking someone does that sort of <i>thing</i> to you.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(After a moment:)</i> I guess it does, oh <i>"Partner-In-Crime"</i>. Now when I think about it, you're <i>right</i>--he <i>is</i> mine and Quinn's bro, and my mom and dad's son--the DNA tests <i>confirmed</i> that--so I guess he <i>does</i> have a good reason to do what he did--at least I <i>hope</i> he does--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:) --IF</i> he's "Arthur Appleton Jr."--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Ditto:) --IF</i> he's "Arthur Appleton Jr.". <i>(Narrows her eyes, realizes:)</i> Hmmm--I just thought about something <i>else</i> concerning my Big Bro--</p>

<p>JANE: --I'm almost <i>afraid</i> to ask, but <i>do</i> go on.</p>

<p>DARIA: I'm wondering if he's "Arthur Appleton Jr.", then if he's <i>also</i> our <i>"Mysterious Benefactor". (Jane frowns, deep in thought)</i> It <i>would</i> make a certain amount of <i>sense</i>, here. He <i>was</i> with me when I talked to Trent and Mystik Spiral in the cellar when they came back from their "tour". He knew about the guy's disdain for <i>insurance</i>, though I'll admit he <i>didn't</i> know about their disdain of <i>banks</i>, at least I don't <i>think</i> so. The only other problem I can think of with all of this is that he didn't <i>know</i> you or Trent at the time, so he <i>couldn't</i> have given the band that money for <i>you. (Pauses:)</i> Sooo
--<i>why</i> would he do that if he did it?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> I guess that's something <i>else</i> we can mark down when we check tomorrow. <i>(Glances in the passenger side mirror absentmindedly:)</i> Hmmm--call me <i>crazy--</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> --Okay, <i>"Crazy"</i>--what's up?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Still looks in the mirror:)</i> Is it my <i>imagination</i>, or have those <i>same</i> headlights behind us at a distance been <i>following</i> us since we left <i>Pastroni's</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Now glances in the driver side and rearview mirrors:)</i> I don't know--headlights are just <i>headlights</i> to me. How can you tell?</p>

<p>JANE: I dunno--I could've <i>sworn</i> those were the <i>same</i> headlights, that's all. <i>(Shrugs, looks forward:)</i> Ah, it's probably just eating too much <i>dried</i> cheeseburger.</p>

<p>DARIA: Or eating too many <i>rubbery-tasting</i> onion rings. Hey, we're here at this <i>uppity-disco</i> dance hall. <i>Strap</i> yourself in for <i>"stupidity personified". (Gets out with Jane)</i></p>


     <p>Darren and Sandi walked into the vestibule to the high-class teen-oriented nightclub, where they promptly met a huge, muscle-bound bald man with an earring, probably a bouncer, to Darren almost as large as that "Rocco" he met that night in the <i>Zen</i>. The man had a stern look on his face, with his arms crossed, looking Darren and Sandi over. Another man, much smaller and thinner, with a bony face, and obviously wearing a toupee, came from behind him, and took the money that Darren paid ($50 each for him and Sandi), and let them by. A minute later, Daria and Jane came up. By this time, several other people were in line ahead of and behind them, waiting to get in. Jane, in front of Daria, leaned back to her, and spoke.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Glances at the man, in a low voice:)</i> Hellooo--<i>King Kong</i> at 12:00.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks, in the same voice:)</i> Hmmm--I wonder if that guy could take on your <i>"good buddy"</i> Rocco?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:) Pardon</i>? How, my dear friend, is <i>Rocco</i> my "good buddy"?</p>

<p>DARIA: If it <i>wasn't</i> for Rocco, you wouldn't kave <i>kissed</i> my bro in the <i>Zen</i>, and you two would've <i>never</i> gotten together. <i>(Jane rolls her eyes, blushes slightly)</i> Ahhh, <i>"Fate"</i> occurs in the <i>strangest</i> of ways.</p>

<p>JANE: If <i>that's</i> "Fate" with Rocco, I'd rather take my chances with <i>"Luck"</i>--it sounds like a <i>hell</i> of a better term.</p> 


     <p>Both girls moved up in the line, and came to the big man, who took one look at the two and smirked.</p>


<p>MAN: Huh--you two don't look like you <i>belong</i> here. <i>(Daria and Jane frown)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:) Wow</i>--you've read my <i>mind</i>--I was thinking the <i>exact</i> same thing about <i>you</i>--I think you'd be right at <i>home</i> in one of those <i>scientific research labs</i>--I hear they're looking for <i>muscle-bound lamebrains</i> who show off their usual <i>inordinate</i> amounts of <i>stupidity</i> to compare to the <i>superior</i> intelligence of the <i>amoebas</i> that are in those little <i>petrii dishes</i>. If you call <i>now</i>, I'm sure that the scientists there will make an <i>appointment</i> for you--<i>(glances cooly at the now-scowling man, while Jane smirks, and couples behind them snicker:)</i> though in <i>your</i> case, they'll take one <i>look</i> at you, and probably hire you on the <i>spot</i>.</p>

<p>MAN: <i>(Furious:)</i> Why you <i>little</i>--just for <i>that</i>, you can--</p>


     <p>Daria pulled out <i>$200</i> from her pocket (part of the money Darren had given her), and <i>waved</i> it just as the other man came from behind the large man. The smaller man's eyes lit up when he saw Daria's money.</p>


<p>SMALL MAN: Well, just don't <i>stand</i> there, <i>Curly--(Jane snickers a little at the name, and whispers something into Daria's ear, and Daria smirks)</i> let these two young ladies through!</p>

<p>CURLY: <i>(Red-faced:)</i> But <i>Mr. Shaw</i>--</p>

<p>MR. SHAW: <i>(Scowls, cuts him off:) --No</i> buts, Curly! Let them through, okay? <i>(Frowning, Curly lets a smirking Daria and Jane by)</i> I'm <i>so</i> sorry about that scene, ladies--enjoy yourselves.</p>


     <p>Daria gave Mr. Shaw $100, and Jane looked around to Curly, who was still watching them with a surly look, and spoke, smirking.</p>


<p>JANE: Hey <i>"Curly"</i>--say hello to <i>Moe</i> and <i>Larry</i> for us, will you? I just <i>loved</i> those scenes where Moe <i>smacked</i> you upside the head when you did something <i>stupid</i>--which, now when I <i>think</i> about it, usually occured <i>all</i> of the time--<i>nyuk, nyuk, nyuk! (Walks off with Daria, and both follow Mr. Shaw, while Curly clenches his teeth at them for a second, then grudgingly goes back to checking out the patrons who are still in line.)</i></p>


     <p>Both girls walked into a huge, open room packed with young people. Unlike the <i>Zen</i> or even the slightly better-kept <i>McGrundy's</i>, this place was basically <i>clean</i> in appearance, with a section of tables and a bar on the side (that sold only non-alcoholic drinks--this <i>is</i> a teen-oriented nightclub, mind you), and brightly-colored walls and floors, with flashing neon lights. The patrons were <i>"ordinary-looking"</i> (as opposed to the Goth-looking teenagers in the <i>Zen</i>), and clean-cut, (though most of the young ladies were wearing skimpy dresses similar to Sandi's) or as either Daria or Jane would label them, <i>"Preppies"</i>. TLC's <i>Unpretty</i> was playing, and everyone was dancing to the beat. Mr. Shaw turned to the girls and shouted over the loud music.</p>


<p>MR. SHAW: Well, here we are, ladies! <i>Enjoy</i> yourselves! If you need anything, just <i>call</i> me!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Just as loud, looks around at the scantily-dressed girls:) What</i> should we <i>call</i> you--<i>"The Head Pimp"</i>?! <i>(Jane smirks)</i></p>

<p>MR. SHAW: <i>(Leans over to Daria:) What</i>?! I <i>still</i> can't hear you! Ah, it doesn't matter! Have <i>fun</i>, ladies! <i>(Leaves, while Daria rolls her eyes)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Looks around with Daria, in her loud voice:)</i> What do you want to do, Daria?!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Ditto:)</i> Actually, to get the <i>hell</i> out of here, but since I can't, let's go over to that <i>phony</i> bar for some <i>fake</i> martinis, or something!</p>

<p>JANE: Sounds perfectly reasonable, amiga! <i>(Follows Daria, but steals a look in the crowd for Darren while she does)</i></p>


     <p>Meanwhile, after coming in, (by which Sandi had gotten <i>stares</i> from <i>jealous</i> girls who <i>swooned</i> after Darren, something Sandi had <i>anticipated</i> and <i>thoroughly</i> enjoyed seeing), Darren and Sandi had started to dance, though it seemed to Sandi that Darren's <i>heart</i> was not in it, for he kept <i>looking around</i>, as if he were trying to <i>find</i> someone (Jane and Daria, of course). She spoke in a <i>mildly</i> annoyed tone, above the throng of humanity.</p>


<p>SANDI: Darren! Like, is there something <i>wrong</i>?! You look like you're dis--dis--<i>distracted</i>, or something!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Quickly looks back down at Sandi:)</i> Eh?! Oh, I'm just uh--looking at how big a <i>crowd</i> is in here, that's all! This <i>Haven</i> can really <i>pack</i> them in, huh?!</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Shrugs, gives a quick look around herself:)</i> I, like, guess! I heard it's <i>always</i> like this! <i>(Gets a wicked smirk:)</i> Come on--show me what you can <i>really</i> do, Darren! <i>(Suddenly snuggles up <b>against</b> him, in a <b>gyrating</b> motion)</i></p>


     <p>Darren's eyes lit up as <i>wide</i> as they could get, and he froze at Sandi's rather--<i>suggestive</i> dance movements for a moment, then backed off, shocked, while people around them continued to dance.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Now stops dancing, scowls:) Sandi</i>! What do you think you're <i>doing</i>?!</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Scowls herself as well as stopping her dancing, too:)</i> I'm like, trying to get you to have some <i>fun</i>, Darren! It <i>is</i> part of the <i>"deal"</i>, remember?!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Narrows his eyes, in a firm tone:) No</i>--the <i>"deal"</i> was for me to go out with you so you wouldn't kick Quinn <i>out</i> of the Fashion Club, nothing more, nothing <i>less</i>! Trying to do--<i>(motions:) this</i> wasn't a <i>part</i> of it! I <i>told</i> you I <i>have</i> a girlfriend, Sandi! Maybe you're <i>used</i> to going out with guys who don't give a <i>damn</i> about <i>two-timing</i> their girlfriends, but I <i>won't</i> do that to <i>Jane</i>, got that?!</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Pouts:)</i> Hey, you don't have to, like, be so <i>postal</i> about it, okay?! I <i>won't</i> do that anymore, if you feel so <i>strongly</i> about it!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Calms down somewhat:)</i> I <i>do</i>! <i>(Sighs:)</i> Now--are you ready to <i>continue</i> without the--<i>"intimate"</i> contact?!</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> I, like--guess! <i>(Begins to dance again with Darren, though at a bit of a further distance from him)</i></p>


     <p>Daria and Jane went up to the <i>"bar"</i>, and sat down. The <i>"bartender"</i>, a brown-haired woman in her early twenties, came to them, talking over the current loud music.</p>


<p>BARTENDER: What'll it be, ladies?!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Puts her hand on her forehead, and her elbows on the counter:)</i> An <i>asprin</i> and some <i>water</i>, please--and a <i>tommy-gun</i> to <i>quiet</i> this <i>damn</i> crowd! <i>(Jane smirks, but so does the "bartender", who reaches under the bar counter and gives Daria the asprin and a small glass of water, which surprises Daria a little)</i></p>

<p>BARTENDER: Yeah, it <i>is</i> pretty <i>loud</i> in here, isn't it?! It's like this <i>most</i> of the week, but especially the <i>weekends</i>, as you might imagine! <i>(Looks at Jane:)</i> What will <i>you</i> have?!</p>

<p>JANE: Gimmie a club soda, bartender! <i>(The "bartender" does so)</i> You seem to be the first <i>"normal"</i> person here we've met since we came into this <i>"preppy-rathole"</i>! Is this just a <i>part-time</i> job for you, or something?!</p>

<p>BARTENDER: <i>(While giving Jane the soda:)</i> Yep! I go to a <i>college</i> nearby, and this <i>"job"</i> provides me with some extra dough, though I could use a little more cash from that <i>miser</i> of an owner, <i>Shaw</i>! Did you guys <i>meet</i> him when you came in?!</p>

<p>DARIA: You mean that ol' <i>Hugh Hefner</i> wannabe?! <i>(Smirks:)</i> Yeah--we were <i>escorted</i> in by him--I waved some <i>money</i> in his <i>face</i>, and he <i>drooled</i> at it! <i>(Pauses:)</i> He's a regular <i>bloodhound</i> when it comes to <i>getting</i> money, huh?!</p>

<p>BARTENDER: Uh-huh! Too bad he doesn't <i>give</i> it out as much! I'd <i>quit</i>, but this is the <i>nearest</i> best-paying job to my college! You <i>sure</i> you don't want anything else?!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Well, I suppose I can get something else--give me a <i>root beer</i>! <i>(The "bartender" does so)</i></p>


     <p>Just as the music was dying down and changing to another, quieter song, two teen-age boys, one, a tall fellow with a ring in his eyelid, and the other, a short one with a crewcut, came up to the bar, with the tall one going over to Daria, and the shorter one going over to Jane. Both boys had <i>leering</i> looks.</p>


<p>TALL BOY: <i>(Grins, gets into a "seductive" tone:) Hello</i>, ladies! <i>(Looks around:)</i> Are you two all <i>alone</i> in this big ol' place?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan, looks around as well, sarcastic:) Gosh</i>, I <i>think</i> we are, but I could be <i>mistaken</i>, you know. I suppose if one <i>eliminates</i> all of these people in this building that are here right <i>now</i>, including the bartender, here--we <i>would</i> be alone. Otherwise, I can't be <i>too</i> sure. <i>(Narrows her eyes at the boy:)</i> What do <i>you</i> think?</p>

<p>TALL BOY: <i>(Grin slowly goes from his face, looks foolish:)</i> Oh, uh--yeah--<i>right</i>. What I <i>meant</i> was, did you two <i>come</i> here alone?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:) Nope</i>--we came here with <i>each other--(raises her eyebrow up and down in a <b>suggestive</b> way:) if</i> you know what I mean. <i>(Daria looks at Jane out of the corner of her eye, and smirks ever-so-slightly)</i></p>

<p>SHORT BOY: <i>(Looks between Jane and Daria, alarmed:)</i> Y-you mean you two--</p>

<p>DARIA: --<i>Uh-huh--alone. Just-me-and-her.</i></p>

<p>TALL BOY: <i>(Frowns:) Crap</i>. Sorry, uh, <i>excuse</i> us--<i>(leaves quickly with the short boy while the "bartender" smirks)</i></p>

<p>BARTENDER: May I ask you two a <i>question</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(While drinking her root beer, looks at Jane, who nods while drinking her club soda:)</i> You may proceed.</p>

<p>BARTENDER: <i>(Leans on the counter:)</i> Are you two, well--</p>

<p>DARIA: --<i>No</i>, we're <i>not</i>. That <i>idiot</i> asked if we came here <i>alone</i>, and Jane told him the <i>truth</i>. We <i>did</i> come here with each other, and <i>not</i> alone--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> --It's not <i>our</i> fault if that guy and his friend took it the <i>wrong</i> way.</p> 

<p>BARTENDER: <i>(Grins:)</i> Oh, I see--<i>shrewd</i>, ladies. So, you two are just hanging out, or what?</p>

<p>DARIA: Try the <i>"what"</i>. Actually, my bro and <i>(motions at Jane:) her</i> boyfriend are out there fulfilling an <i>"obligation"</i> to my sister--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Frowns:)</i> --By being with a damn <i>she-wolf</i>.</p>

<p>BARTENDER: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> Now I <i>am</i> curious. What's up?</p>


     <p>Daria and Jane looked at each other, then Jane began to explain.</p>

     <p>At the same moment, a small, tan car came into the <i>Haven</i> parking lot, and drove past the grey Camry with the man in it. He looked at it, and then did a bit of a double-take when he saw who was getting out of it after it had parked. <i>Quinn, Tiffany,</i> and the driver, <i>Stacy</i>, got out. All three were dressed to <i>kill</i>. Quinn wore a white, off-the-shoulder sequin dress, Tiffany, a green, short-sleeved rhinestone dress, and Stacy, a light blue, long-sleeved sheer dress.</p>


<p>STACY: <i>(Nervous along with Tiffany:)</i> Gosh, Quinn--are you <i>sure</i> about this? I mean, I don't know if we should <i>stand up</i> to Sandi!</p>

<p>TIFFANY: Yeah...</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> Stacy! Tiffany! We're <i>not</i> gonna be doing <i>any</i> of that, okay? All I sayin' is that we kind of <i>"run into"</i> Sandi with Darren! I mean, she <i>didn't</i> tell you about what she was gonna do, right? <i>(Narrows her eyes:)</i> Do you guys think that was <i>fair</i> to <i>you</i>? <i>(Stacy and Tiffany look at each other, ponder Quinn's words)</i> Besides, she <i>abused</i> her office when she made that <i>"deal"</i> with my bro to keep me in th' Fashion Club! <i>(Then as an afterthought, adds:)</i> I know you two were--<i>attracted</i> to Darren, and Sandi <i>competed</i> with you over my bro, and <i>outmanuvered</i> you to get to him! Do you want her to get <i>away</i> with that? <i>(Pauses:)</i> Hey, I know what I did was <i>wrong</i> when you all first met Darren, but do you think what she did was any <i>better</i>?</p> 

<p>STACY: <i>(Looks down, still unsure:)</i> I--guess that's <i>true</i>, Quinn--</p>

<p>TIFFANY: <i>(Ditto:)</i> I...suppose...you've...got...a...point...Quinn--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Smirks:) Damn</i> straight I do! <i>(Pauses:)</i> Look, it's not like we'll be confronting her <i>together</i> at first, so she can't say that you're <i>defying</i> her by being with me, 'cause she <i>doesn't</i> know that we came in together! Remember the <i>plan</i>--I'll come up on her <i>first</i>, then you two <i>"happen"</i> to come up behind me.</p>

<p>STACY: O-okay, Quinn--d-did you really <i>mean</i> it when you said you'd <i>pay</i> for us?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Sighs:) Of course</i> I did, Stacy! My <i>dad</i> let me use his <i>credit card</i> to get some cash, an' I have it right <i>here</i>! <i>(Shows the cash to them)</i> Now, let's carry out <i>"Operation Cookiejar"</i>, okay? <i>(Leads the two girls to the club with a determined look on her face, and all three pay Mr. Shaw and go into the club past "Curly", who is <b>ogling</b> at them until Mr. Shaw <b>whacks</b> him on the back and motions him to continue to check out the customers)</i></p>


     <p>Meanwhile, Daria and Jane were finishing telling the story to the <i>"bartender"</i>, who <i>whistled</i> in awe.</p>


<p>BARTENDER: Oh boy--and <i>you're (looks at Jane:)</i> allowing your <i>boyfriend</i> to <i>do</i> this? Girl, that takes <i>guts</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Snorts, rolls her eyes:)</i> Don't forget a healthy dose of <i>stupidity</i>. I'm not giving my <i>permission</i> to allow Sandi Griffin to date Darren for my <i>health</i>, you know--<i>(frowns:)</i> and if Sandi's <i>smart</i>, she'll be able to <i>keep</i> hers if she <i>behaves</i>.</p>

<p>BARTENDER: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Then I suppose you're allowing it for Daria's <i>sister</i>? <i>(Daria now smirks herself, while Jane <b>gags</b>.)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Puts her hand on her forehead, shuts her eyes, sighs:) Don't</i> remind me. It's just that, well--</p>


     <p><i>Quinn</i> suddenly came up beside Daria, Jane and the "bartender", surprising both girls, sitting up beside them at the counter, and <i>smirking</i>.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>Hiiii</i>, guys! <i>(Daria and Jane roll their eyes)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: Speaking of which--say hello to my <i>sister</i>, Quinn. <i>(Smirks sinisterly:)</i> Say "hello" to the nice bartender, <i>"siiis". (Quinn glares at Daria, while Jane gives a very smug look at Quinn)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Remembers her new "agreement" with Daria over saying Daria's her sister in public, now:)</i> Uh--hi, sis--Jane, um--<i>(looks away and around quickly)</i></p>

<p>BARTENDER: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow, smirks:)</i> --Just call me your <i>"bartender"</i>--did you want something to wet your whistle, honey?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Puts her hand up:)</i> Um, no thanks.</p>

<p>BARTENDER: <i>(Notices:)</i> Excuse me, gals--other customers. <i>(Leaves to the other side of the bar)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: Behold--it's an <i>illusion</i> of <i>disastrous</i> proportions, Jane. Quinn, what in the <i>hell</i> are you doing here?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>What</i> does it <i>look</i> like, Daria?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks over the way Quinn's dressed:)</i> It seems to me that you're trying to allow <i>dollar bills</i> to be placed in your dress for a free <i>show. (Jane smirks)</i>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Frowns:)</i> Oh, you're <i>really</i> funny, Daria.</p> 

<p>DARIA: No, <i>seriously</i>, why are you here? I thought you were going to join <i>"Laverne and Shirley"</i> for an <i>"overnight clandestine fashion-ego booster get-together"</i>, or something. Aren't you <i>concerned</i> about what <i>mom</i> and <i>dad</i> will <i>do</i> if they <i>call</i> over at Stacy's to <i>check</i> on you? You might not <i>ever</i> leave <i>home</i> again until you're <i>21</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Rolls her eyes:) Daaaaria</i>! You gotta remember that mom and dad are at home <i>alone</i>, an' are--<i>(shudders, disgusted look:)</i> you <i>know</i>--they're gonna be <i>so</i> into each other, <i>(ick)</i> the <i>last</i> thing they'll think about is <i>me</i>! Besides, the curfew is <i>off</i> for tonight, remember? Oh, and if you're worried about a <i>guy</i> bringing me here an' <i>breakin'</i> my stupid punishment rules an' stuff, it's <i>cool</i>--Stacy drove her mom's car, and me an' Tiffany rode with her here.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Well, <i>you</i> were the <i>last</i> thing <i>I</i> was thinking about while I was sitting here with Jane. <i>(Quinn narrows her eyes and glares at Daria while Jane smirks)</i> Anyway, what about the <i>Rowes</i>? Don't you think <i>they</i> might think <i>something's</i> amiss when their daughter and her friends are missing from their humble abode?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Stacy's parents are <i>out</i> of town for the weekend, an' the Rowes <i>trust</i> their daughter--</p>

<p>JANE: --<i>Unlike</i> Helen and Jake <i>not</i> trusting <i>you</i>? <i>(Daria smirks)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Glares at Jane:)</i> Hey! <i>You're</i> one to <i>talk</i>, you know! You're <i>trusting</i> Darren to be with Sandi!</p>

<p>JANE: Only to keep <i>you</i> in the Fashion Club so you can go to your <i>"little"</i> Fashion Institute, and for the record, it's <i>Sandi</i> that I don't trust with Darren!</p> 

<p>DARIA: Back to my <i>original</i> question--<i>why</i> are you here, Quinn? Jane and I are keeping an eye on Sandi, so what's the deal?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Smirks:)</i> I'm gonna get <i>back</i> at Sandi--do you know that Tiffany an' Stacy didn't know about what she's done, other than me bein' on fashion sabbatical? Sandi's <i>abusin'</i> her office!</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Faux alarm:)</i> Uh-oh--time to <i>impeach</i> the "prez"--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan, smirks:) --<b>"What</b> does President Griffin know, and <b>when</b> did she know it?"</i> Will the <i>trial</i> be conducted in front of a <i>"Fashion Tribunal"</i>? If so, I'll inform the <i>media</i> for you--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Gets up off the barstool:) --Laugh</i> if you must--</p>

<p>JANE: --Oh, we <i>will</i>--</p>

<p>QUINN: --But I gotta <i>expose</i> Sandi! Excuse me! <i>(Goes off into the crowd)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>"Expose"</i> Sandi? If that's the case, all she has to do is <i>touch</i> Sandi's <i>flimsy</i> dress, and it would <i>fall</i> off for the <i>ultimate</i> exposure!</p>

<p>JANE: Of course, if someone would do that to <i>Quinn</i>, the <i>same</i> thing would happen--</p>

<p>DARIA: --To Quinn and all the other <i>scantily-clad</i> girls in this place. If guys want to get their fill of <i>"hoochie"</i>, they've come to the <i>right</i> place here.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>Tell</i> me about it. <i>(Changes tone, scans crowd:)</i> Seen <i>Darren</i> yet?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Also scans:)</i> No, not--<i>hold it</i>--there he is--over there. <i>(Points to the left side of the room:)</i> You see them now?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Narrows her eyes:) Nooot</i> yet--<i>yeah</i>! <i>(Pauses:)</i> He doesn't look like he's <i>enjoying</i> himself--this <i>really</i> makes me feel <i>relieved</i>, you understand.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Scans, smirks:)</i> He's got <i>"Jane on the brain"</i>, I <i>told</i> you that. <i>(Scans some more:)</i> Ah, <i>now</i> the <i>fun</i> begins--look over to the <i>center</i> of the room. <i>(Jane follows Daria's lead)</i> There's Quinn dancing <i>"towards"</i> Darren and Sandi from the center, with a <i>barrelful</i> of boys <i>"sniffing"</i> behind her--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Brightens up:) Ooh</i>--and <i>there's</i> Tiffany and Stacy with a <i>handful</i> of boys dancing <i>"towards"</i> Darren and Sandi from the <i>right</i> side! Y'know, this should actually prove <i>interesting</i>, amiga.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> And here I thought we were gonna be <i>bored</i> out of our skulls. <i>(Eyes bowlful of peanuts, gets it, passes it to Jane:)</i> Nuts?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Takes the bowl:)</i> Hey, thanks--that <i>dry</i> burger didn't fill me up. <i>(Starts munching:)</i> How perfectly appropiate--<i>eating</i> nuts while <i>watching</i> them--save for <i>Darren</i>, of course.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(While munching as well:)</i> That's not <i>quite</i> true for my Big Bro--after all, he's <i>"nuts"</i> for <i>you--(Jane smirks)</i> now, let the <i>show</i> begin.</p>


     <p>Sandi had tried to <i>entice</i> Darren with her <i>suggestive</i> dance movements, but he had not bitten at her <i>"bait"</i>, even when the two slow-danced, for he was the <i>perfect</i> gentleman while he held her--much to her <i>chagrin</i>. He kept his hands lightly on her back and shoulders, but that was about it--no attempts to <i>"lower"</i> them. She had tried to once again <i>lean up</i> against him, but he gently held her back at a <i>respectable</i> distance--<i>several</i> times, in fact. This was becoming like a <i>game</i>--and Sandi was <i>losing</i>. It was getting <i>frustrating</i> to Sandi--here, she was the <i>envy</i> of many of the girls who had watched the two come in, and she couldn't take <i>full</i> advantage of him in <i>front</i> of them. Sandi was thinking about trying <i>one</i> more trick, when suddenly a girl <i>"bumped"</i> into Darren from the back. Sandi looked around Darren, who had not looked around himself yet, and <i>frowned</i>. Several people stopped dancing, and watched, and in the meantime, the music had started to die down as well.</p>


<p>SANDI: <i>Quinn</i>! What are <i>you</i> doing here?!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Surprised:) Quinn</i>?! Where'd you come from?!</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Faux shock, gasps:) Darren! Sandi</i>! This <i>is</i> a surprise! It's a <i>small</i> world, isn't it?!</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Narrows her eyes:)</i> I don't know what's going <i>on</i> here, but I think you're <i>up</i> to something! Did you <i>know</i> we were going to be <i>here</i>?!</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>("Innocent" look on here face:) What</i>?! I don't know what you're talking about Sandi! Hi, bro!</p>

<p>DARREN: Uh, hi, Quinn--I thought you were with-- <i>(flinches when he's bumped from behind again:) eh</i>? <i>(Looks behind him:) Stacy</i>? <i>Tiffany</i>?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Shocked:) Staaacy</i>? <i>Tiiiffany</i>? What are <i>you</i> two <i>dooing</i> here?</p>

<p>STACY: <i>(Really nervous, but bravely goes on:) S-S-S-Sandi</i>! <i>Q-Q-Q-Quinn</i>! <i>D-D-Darren</i>! <i>T-T-Tiffany</i>! F-f-fancy m-m-meeting y-you guys here! <i>EEP</i>! I'm not supposed to <i>talk</i> to you, Quinn! Sorry!</p>

<p>TIFFANY: <i>(Same way as Stacy, but I'll spare you her stammering:)</i> Uhhh...hiiii..guuuys...IIIII..mean..Sandi...Darrrren....</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Looks between the girls, suspicious:)</i> Something's like, <i>definitely</i> not right here, but I sure as <i>hell</i> intend to <i>find out</i>! <i>(Goes to the "weak link", laser-beam focus:) Staaacy</i>, did <i>Quinn</i> put you <i>up</i> to this?!</p> 

<p>STACY: <i>(Sweats profusely, while Quinn mouths to her out of Sandi's sight, "Be strong":) N-n-no</i>, S-S-Sandi! I-I-I c-can't t-talk <i>t-to</i> Q-Q-Quinn, r-r-remember? H-h-how c-could she p-plan to do s-something w-with m-me if w-we c-couldn't t-talk t-to e-each o-other?! <i>(Weak laugh)</i></p>


     <p>Sandi looked at Stacy with her iron gaze a moment more, then rolled her eyes over to <i>Tiffany</i>. Stacy let out a silent, deep breath of <i>relief</i> the moment Sandi turned away, holding her rapidly-beating heart, and closing her eyes. Darren watched the scene with the other dancers, both <i>fasinated</i>, and <i>amused</i>.</p>


<p>SANDI: <i>(Gives the same look to Tiffany, but in a more "diplomatic" way, tries to play up to the "yes-woman":)</i> Tiiiffany, I'm sure you had very <i>little</i> to do with this, right? Did you follow Quinn's <i>instructions</i>, and come out here with her?</p>

<p>TIFFANY: <i>(Slightly more cooler, but with Tiffany, it's kind of hard to tell:)</i> I...don't...know...what...you're...talking...about...Sandi...</p>


     <p>Sandi looked at Tiffany and <i>grimced</i>. It was clear the <i>"yes-woman"</i> was not going to <i>crack</i>, and point the finger. Sandi began to slowly turn <i>red</i> with rage. Quinn, sensing an <i>opening</i>, pounced.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(With faux ignorance:)</i> So, um, Sandi? What are you doin' here with <i>Darren</i>? I mean, isn't he <i>Jane's</i> boyfriend, or something?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Gives Quinn the glare to end all glares:)</i> We weren't like, doing anything! Just a little dinner and dancing, that's all, <i>(frowns:)</i> you probably <i>asked</i> him where we were going, and you knew <i>why--(suddenly stops, checks herself, realizes she's said more than she intended)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Narrows her eyes:) --"Why"</i>, Sandi? <i>"Why"</i> what? Do <i>Stacy</i> and <i>Tiffany</i> know <i>"why"</i>, huh?</p> 

<p>SANDI: <i>(Looks lost, which is unbearable for her in front of the others, especially Quinn, tries to re-take the high ground:)</i> Like, uh, because um, Darren <i>chose</i> to take me out on his <i>own</i>! <i>(Suddenly hooks her arm with Darren's:) Right</i>, Darren? <i>(Quinn gasps in anger, while Sandi smirks)</i></p>


     <p>Darren couldn't believe what was going on--first, there was some sort of verbal <i>"battle"</i> between a suddenly-appearing Quinn and Sandi, and he was being dragged into it <i>against</i> his will! He looked around for a moment, dumbfounded, and spotted <i>Jane</i> and <i>Daria</i> at the bar. Both were leaning back on the counter, and watching with great interest, eating peanuts and <i>smirking</i> at the situation. <i>If only <b>I</b> could be up there <b>with</b> them instead of--</i></p>


<p>SANDI: <i>(Looks up at Darren:) --Darren</i>! Did you <i>hear</i> me?! I said you <i>chose</i> to take me out, right?!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gives a quick look between Sandi and Quinn, looking unsure:)</i> Uh, ah--that is--</p>


     <p>Suddenly, <i>Mr. Shaw</i> and <i>Curly</i> made their way through the crowd, and both were frowning.</p> 


<p>MR. SHAW: <i>(Looks between everyone:)</i> What in the <i>hell</i> is going <i>on</i> here, people?! I won't tolerate <i>violence</i> in <i>my</i> club!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Calmly:)</i> No problem, sir, there was only a <i>misunderstanding</i>, right, girls?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Angry:) Oooooh, nooo</i>--there's <i>no</i> "misunderstanding" here! <i>(Glares at Quinn, releases Darren's arm, goes up to Quinn's face:)</i> I know you <i>had</i> to be <i>behind</i> this, Quinn! I can't <i>prove</i> it--<i>yet</i>, or how you've <i>turned</i> Tiffany and Stacy <i>against</i> me, but I suspect you had a <i>hand</i> in this!</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Cool exterior, in a calm voice:)</i> You're right about <i>one</i> thing, Sandi, there's <i>no</i> "misunderstanding" here--you, like <i>abused</i> your office when you took Darren out with you just to keep me in th' Fashion Club, <i>admit</i> it!</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Hey, <i>I'm</i> not the one who <i>lied</i> about having a sister after all this time, and passing her off as my <i>"cousin"</i>! <i>(Gasps in the audience)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Furious, begins to step forward:)</i> Why you--</p>


     <p><i>Curly</i> suddenly stepped in between the girls, and gently separated them, which still did not stop Sandi from speaking.</p>


<p>SANDI: Quinn, using my power and authority as president of the Fashion Club, I hereby excu--excumun--<i>kick</i> you <i>out</i> of the Fashion Club! <i>(Darren and Quinn looked shocked, while Daria and Jane look at each other, surprised)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Mouth agape:)</i> Y-you can't <i>do</i> that! <i>(Looks at Tiffany and Stacy, pleading look:)</i> Guys, <i>help</i> me!</p>


     <p>Tiffany and Stacy looked at each other and then Quinn, sheepishly, then looked away uneasily.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Frowns:)</i> Sandi, we had a <i>deal</i>! <i>(Quinn gets a <b>very</b> sinister look on her face, while Tiffany and Stacy look at each other)</i> You're now going <i>back</i> on it?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Haughty look, not realizing what Darren has said:)</i> It's not <i>my</i> fault that Quinn forced the <i>issue</i> here! All she had to do was to say and do <i>nothing</i>, and--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Lights up, points at Sandi:) AH-HA</i>! You <i>admit</i> you wanted to go out with Darren in return for me staying in the Fashion Club?! <i>(People in the audience make "ooooh" and "aaaah" sounds, looking at each other, then Quinn grins wickedly:)</i> Even my <i>bro</i> said you guys had a deal! <i>(Darren sighs, exasperated)</i></p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> Like, uh, that is <i>so</i> not true--</p>

<p>MR. SHAW: <i>(Having enough:) --OKAY, THAT'S IT</i>! I don't care who did what, I want all of you people <i>out</i> of here, right now! Curly, start with <i>him. (Points at an astounded Darren:) "Escort"</i> the <i>"lover-boy"</i> out of here first, then the <i>others</i> in his party.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Glances up at the ceiling with a look of disbelief on his face:)</i> Why does <i>everyone</i> seem to think that <i>I'm</i> after <i>all</i> the girls?</p>

<p>CURLY: <i>(Starts to walk over to Darren, grins wickedly, cracks his knuckles:)</i> With <i>pleasure</i>, Mr. Shaw. <i>(Quinn, Tiffany, Stacy, and even Sandi look at each other, uncomfortably--this was definitely <b>not</b> expected)</i></p>


     <p>Daria and Jane watched the spectacle intently, and the "bartender" had stopped doing her work, watching intently as well.</p>


<p>BARTENDER: Oh <i>crap</i>--it looks as there's gonna be some <i>trouble</i> for your boyfriend, Jane.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Begins to smirk:)</i> Oh, I don't <i>know</i> about that. Let's see <i>what</i> happens.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Cuts her eyes over at Daria, a little uneasily:)</i> You seem <i>awfully</i> sure Darren can <i>handle</i> this guy, Daria. <i>"Curly-Joe"</i> looks pretty <i>big</i>--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Still smirks:)</i> --Maybe if you <i>rushed</i> out there to Darren and <i>kissed</i> him, Curly might <i>not</i> fight him. <i>(Jane mock-glares at Daria, while the "bartender" looks at them oddly for a second, then resumes to watch what will happen on the floor)</i></p>


     <p>Curly grinned as he came up to Darren, who had backed up a bit, and was <i>sizing</i> Curly up, narrowing his eyes.</p>


<p>CURLY: You can go out one of <i>two</i> ways--you can be <i>carried</i> out, or you can be <i>thrown</i> out. What's it gonna be?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(After a moment:)</i> Look, I really don't want any <i>trouble</i>--how about if I just <i>walked</i> out on my <i>own</i>?</p> 

<p>CURLY: <i>Wrong</i> answer.</p> 


     <p>Curly lunged at Darren, who smoothly ducked under him, leaped in the air, and <i>kicked</i> the bouncer in the head. Curly stumbled forward, and fell down on the floor on his back. He looked up at Darren, dazed and stunned. Quinn looked at an <i>impressed</i> Sandi, Tiffany, and Stacy and <i>smirked</i>. Others in the crowd talked amongst themselves, impressed, especially the <i>females</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: I <i>told</i> you my bro can take care of himself, Sandi.</p>

<p>SANDI: Like, I guess he <i>can</i>, Quinn.</p>

<p>MR. SHAW: <i>(Looks down at Curly:)</i> Get your <i>ass</i> up, you <i>lummox</i>! I don't pay you to just <i>lie</i> there on the floor and look like an <i>idiot</i>!</p>


     <p>Curly foolishly looked at his boss for a moment, then <i>glared</i> at Darren, and got up in a rage, <i>snarling</i> like an animal. Once again, he rushed Darren, but Darren again smoothly avoided him on the side, and <i>chopped</i> Curly on the back of his neck, knocking him to the floor, and out <i>cold</i>. Mr. Shaw looked down at his fallen bouncer, stunned. The whole room was totally the same--save for a <i>proud</i> Quinn. Daria, Jane, and the "bartender" looked at each other, and <i>smirked</i>.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> Well, <i>that</i> certainly was over <i>fast</i>. At least I got a chance to actually <i>see</i> my bro in "action", and I must say, he's one <i>hell</i> of an <i>ass-kicker</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Wicked smirk:)</i> Oh, I'm <i>sooo</i> damn <i>lucky</i>--I've <i>gotta</i> take some <i>"lessons"</i> from that boy--</p>

<p>BARTENDER: <i>Wow</i>--and Curly usually had his way with <i>everyone</i> in here--I've <i>never</i> seen anyone taken out <i>so</i> fast. Jane, you've got a <i>rare</i> gem there--<i>don't</i> lose it. <i>(Pauses, coy voice:)</i> Of course, if you want to <i>pass</i> him on--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Same smirk, still looks in Darren's direction:)</i> Heh--<i>fat chance. (Daria smirks)</i></p>


     <p>Darren took one more glance at Curly, just to make sure he did not get up, then turned towards the now-terrified Mr. Shaw, who was <i>shaking</i> with fear. Darren was <i>scowling</i>, and spoke.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Through clenched teeth:)</i> All you had to do, <i>"sir"</i>, was let me leave on my <i>own</i>. I <i>told</i> you I didn't want any trouble. Now, if you don't mind, I'll be <i>leaving</i>--on my <i>own. (Shaw nods his head in agreement quickly, and stands aside, then Darren brushes past him and starts to leave, but turns back towards him with a slight smirk:)</i> Uh, your <i>pants</i> are <i>wet</i>. Maybe you should <i>change</i> them? <i>(Mr. Shaw looks down on himself, turns red with embarassment, then runs off the floor while everyone laughs at him)</i></p> 

<p>SANDI: <i>(Becoming wide-eyed:)</i> Uh, Darren, what about--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>Sorry</i>, Sandi, but if you're going to kick my sister <i>out, (Quinn glares at Sandi, while Tiffany and Stacy look heartbroken)</i> then we have <i>nothing</i> more to do with each other on this <i>"date". (Starts to leave)</i> I'm sure you can find your own--</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Becomes alarmed:) Wait</i>! <i>(Darren stops, turns around, while Sandi strains to look at Quinn, and be civil at the same time)</i> Er, um, perhaps I was a bit <i>hasty</i>--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Scowls:)</i> A <i>bit</i> hasty? You--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Glares at Quinn, cuts her off sharply:) --Quinn</i>! Let Sandi <i>speak</i>! <i>(Quinn looks at her brother, stunned, while Sandi gives a quick, smug look at Quinn)</i> Go on, Sandi.</p>

<p>SANDI: Oh, um, yes--anyway, like I said, perhaps I was a bit hasty, Darren
--I will <i>not</i> kick Quinn out of the Fashion Club, but <i>only</i> if Tiffany and Stacy <i>admit</i> that they were in <i>league</i> with Quinn against me! <i>(The crowd "oohs" and "ahhs")</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Stunned with Tiffany and Stacy:) WHAT</i>! But--</p>

<p>STACY: <i>(Suddenly jumps down at Sandi's feet, pleads:)</i> Oh, <i>YES, YES, YES</i>, I did it, Sandi! I didn't <i>mean</i> to! <i>Please</i> forgive me! <i>(Starts to <b>cry</b> into the <b>hem</b> of Sandi's dress)</i></p>

<p>TIFFANY: <i>(<b>Bows</b> down to Sandi on one knee, <b>kisses</b> the back of her hand, similar to what a Catholic saint does with the Pope:)</i> I...did...too...sorry...Sandi...please...forgive...me...</p>


     <p>Quinn rolled her eyes, full of <i>rage</i>, with her arms crossed, while Darren (and others in the crowd) viewed the scene with stunned disbelief. Sandi, of course, was on top of the world, with an arrogant smirk that ended <i>all</i> smirks. Daria and Jane simply looked at each other and shook their heads slowly.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan, flat tone:)</i> The status quo has been <i>restored</i>, Lane.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Flat tone as well:)</i> Yes, Morgendorffer--<i>"Queen Sandi"</i> has <i>forgiven</i> her <i>"subjects"</i>--all <i>hail</i> the queen.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Same tone:)</i> I'd prefer to tell her to <i>go</i> to hell.</p>


     <p>Darren then gave Sandi a <i>serious</i> look.</p>


<p>DARREN: If you're <i>finished</i>, I want to leave now. You ready to go?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Comes down after her "high":)</i> Like, sure, Darren--I suppose, since everything's back in it's <i>proper</i> place. If you want to go, we can.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>Let's</i>. I'm <i>sick</i> of being here. <i>(Turns to a fuming Quinn:)</i> Quinn, we'll talk <i>later</i>. Catch a ride back with Tiffany and Stacy. <i>(Leaves with Sandi as the crowd parts to let them through, but as he sees Jane and Daria, his visage softens, and he gives Jane a quick wink and a smile, the same for Daria. Jane smirks contentedly while Daria shrugs, but gives a tiny Mona Lisa smile)</i></p>


     <p>Daria turned back to the "bartender" and pulled out the same $200 she had shown to Mr. Shaw while getting up from the bar with Jane.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>Here</i>--you've <i>earned</i> this tip.</p> 

<p>BARTENDER: <i>(Stunned as she takes the money:)</i> Y-you're giving <i>this</i> much money to <i>me</i>? A-are you <i>sure</i>--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> Uh--yeah, Daria--<i>are</i> you sure?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shrugs at Jane, then looks back at the "bartender":)</i> Why <i>not</i>? Our business is done here, and we don't really need this much money anymore for tonight anyway. I'm sure that my bro won't mind if we gave it <i>away</i>, especially if he's really--<i>(glances at Jane:)</i> well, you <i>know</i>--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Picks up on Daria's lead:)</i> --Oh, uh, yeah--<i>"that guy". (Looks to the bartender, who frowns slightly, perplexed by what Daria and Jane are talking about:)</i> Go on--take it. It'll kind of <i>help</i> you out for college.</p>

<p>BARTENDER: <i>(Smiles as she pockets the money:)</i> Thanks! <i>(Smirks:)</i> I guess I won't be seeing you two around here anymore. Kind of a <i>shame</i>--you two were the most <i>intelligent</i> people I've met since I've been working here.</p>

<p>DARIA: Oh, I <i>doubt</i> that--otherwise, Jane and I <i>wouldn't</i> have come <i>here</i> in the <i>first</i> place. <i>(The "bartender" smirks with Jane, and then Daria and Jane leave)</i> Take it easy. <i>(The "bartender" watches them go, and then resumes her work)</i></p>


     <p>Daria and Jane were leaving the <i>Haven</i> when <i>Quinn</i> came up to them, looking <i>angry</i>. Both girls stopped for a moment, looked at her, and then kept going to the SUV, while Quinn followed them as she was talking. Darren's car had just left the parking lot. Unbeknown to any of the parties, the grey Camry that had followed them all there had <i>gone</i>.</p>


<p>QUINN: Daria, take me back home <i>with</i> you!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Cocks an inquisitive eyebrow with Jane:)</i> What about going back with Stacy and Tiffany?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Scowls:) No</i> freakin' way! They <i>stabbed</i> me in th' <i>back</i>--like <i>Darren</i>! I'm not gonna <i>speak</i> to either one of them for awhile, an' I'm thinkin' about doin' the <i>same</i> thing with my <i>bro</i>! <i>(Looks as she's about to <b>cry</b>:)</i> How could Darren <i>snap</i> at me like that, <i>defending</i> Sandi, of all people, against <i>me</i>, his <i>sister</i>?!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> Perhaps it was because you were about to do something even <i>dumber</i> than just coming out here in the <i>first</i> place with Stacy and Tiffany while Darren and Sandi were out--</p>

<p>JANE: --Like, oh, almost getting yourself <i>kicked out</i> of the Fashion Club, and <i>not</i> being able to go to that Fashion Institute place?</p> 

<p>QUINN: <i>(Even more shocked:) YOU</i> guys are sidin' with Sandi, <i>too</i>?!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Rolls her eyes, sighs:)</i> Quinn--<i>please</i>. I'd sooner have <i>bouncy</i> hair and get a new <i>wardrobe</i> full of your <i>crappy</i> fashions than side with Sandi on just about <i>anything</i>. What we're saying is, is that you didn't have to do <i>anything</i> tonight. Jane and I were here. <i>(Frowns:)</i> You risked <i>everything</i> to come out here just to <i>show up</i> Sandi, and it almost <i>backfired</i>. If anything, I'd wager to guess that Darren <i>saved</i> your ass from <i>embarassing</i> yourself any further--<i>(smirks with Jane while Quinn glares:)</i> although I must say it would've been a <i>glorious</i> battle if you and Sandi actually went at it <i>physically</i>.</p> 

<p>JANE: <i>Surely</i> you're not gonna blame <i>Darren</i> for <i>"making"</i> you come out here with your <i>little</i> friends, and doing all of this to <i>yourself</i>, are you?</p>


     <p>Quinn scowled for a moment more, then looked indignant as she got into the back seat of the SUV while Daria and Jane got in the front, <i>not</i> responding to Jane's question, something that wasn't <i>lost</i> on Daria, but she decided to say nothing for the moment.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Puts on her seat belt:)</i> Hey, what about your small bag of <i>clothes</i> you took while supposedly staying over Stacy's tonight?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Waves it off:)</i> Oh, Stacy or Tiffany will <i>bring</i> them to me over the weekend--they'll wanna get back <i>into</i> my good <i>graces</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow, turns around:)</i> You're <i>sure</i> about that? Based on what happened here tonight, those two looked as if they'd <i>climb a whole damn mountain</i> for Sandi to stay on her good side.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Narrows her eyes, explains with a passion:)</i> For th' <i>moment</i>. Stacy considers me to be her <i>best</i> friend in th' Fashion Club, an' Tiffany would wanna <i>play</i> me <i>against</i> Sandi like she <i>always</i> has. <i>(Smirks:)</i> She doesn't <i>think</i> that I know, but I <i>do</i>. Give it a <i>couple</i> of days, an' they'll both be <i>crawlin'</i> back to me, 'cause they know they won't be gettin' the <i>respect</i> from Sandi like they'll get from <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(While starting the SUV:)</i> Ah, the <i>"intricacies"</i> of Fashion Club <i>politics</i>--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:)</i> --You gotta <i>love</i> it.</p>

<p>DARIA: --Or, in <i>our</i> case, be <i>indifferent</i> to it. <i>(Smirks, while Quinn rolls her eyes)</i> Got another question for you, Quinn--what about <i>mom</i> and <i>dad</i>? What are you gonna say to them when you come up with me dressed like <i>that</i>, and you're <i>not</i> at Stacy's like you <i>promised</i> our parents you would be?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Now becomes wide-eyed as she looks down on herself:)</i> Uh, um--well--<i>(becomes panicked:)</i> you <i>gotta</i> help me, Daria!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Faux concern:)</i> Gee, sis, I <i>don't</i> know--help like <i>that</i> doesn't come <i>cheap</i>--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Pulls out Jake's credit card, smug:)</i> I can get some money out of the ATM for you--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:) --No</i>.</p>

<p>JANE & QUINN: <i>(Shocked:)</i> Huh? Come again?</p>

<p>DARIA: Obviously, you two seem to have a <i>hearing</i> problem, so I'll <i>repeat</i> myself for clarification purposes--<i>no</i>. I want you to give me something <i>more</i> valuable than money, sis--I want your <i>pride. (Quinn frowns, confused)</i> Quinn, if you want me to get you past mom and dad, I want you to <i>promise</i> to try and not to <i>stay</i> angry at Darren for what happened tonight, and admit you were <i>wrong</i> about what you did about coming out there, and <i>apologize</i> to him.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Mouth agape, stunned:)</i> Daria, are you <i>crazy</i>? <i>I</i> wasn't the one who--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Cuts her off:)</i> --Quinn, it's this, or <i>"The Wrath of Helen", or</i>, you can figure something out on your <i>own</i>--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Crosses her arms, pouts, bites her lower lip, slams herself back in her seat:) Fine! Okay!</i> I <i>promise</i> I <i>won't</i> get mad at Darren for tonight, an' I'll say I'm <i>sorry</i> to him, okay?! <i>(Sneers:)</i> Is that <i>it</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Yep.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Leans over to Daria, in a very low tone out of the side of her mouth:)</i> Did I just hear you let Quinn off the <i>hook</i>? You could've gotten a lot of <i>"moolah"</i> off of her!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(In the same tone:)</i> Nah--I've already had a lot of the <i>"moolah"</i> in my hands for tonight, and Quinn would really just be giving me <i>dad's</i> money. Besides, if we're gonna be looking to see if Darren's <i>really</i> is this "Arthur Appleton Jr.", I'd rather have Quinn and Darren on <i>good</i> terms, and--</p>


     <p>Quinn suddenly leaned forward between the two between the front seat, listening.</p>


<p>QUINN: What are you two talkin' about? <i>(Narrows her eyes:)</i> It isn't about <i>me</i>, is it? 'Cause if it is--</p>

<p>DARIA: --Jane and I were just talking, <i>"Nosy"</i>--go back to your <i>"fashion fantasies"</i> and dream of <i>"walkway visions of glory". (Jane smirks)</i> Besides, if we <i>were</i> talking about <i>you</i>, Jane and I would be <i>laughing</i> so <i>hard</i>, I'd probably lose <i>control</i> of the SUV, it would <i>flip</i> like crazy, and we'd all <i>crash and burn. (Quinn scowls at Daria, while Jane tries not to laugh)</i></p>

<p>JANE: C'mon, Quinn--we're just <i>"shooting the breeze"</i>, you know, <i>girl</i> talk and all--no need to get all <i>riled up</i> and everything.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>Oh. (Sits back in the backseat slowly this time, sighs, looks out her door window:)</i> You know, I'll bet Sandi's probably havin' a good <i>laugh</i> at me right now--</p>


     <p>Up ahead, Darren was driving back to Lawndale with Sandi, who looked as <i>smug</i> as she had been in a long time. To her, Darren had put <i>down</i> his <i>own</i> sister, her greatest <i>enemy</i>, in front of that crowd--all for <i>Sandi</i>, and after he cut <i>down</i> that bouncer in a <i>heartbeat</i>. She cut her eyes over at the seemingly <i>impassive</i> and quiet Darren, who looked like he was <i>thinking</i> about something--possibly <i>her</i>? Sandi hoped <i>against</i> hope--did he <i>like</i> her enough to <i>defend</i> her like that? Maybe Darren and that--that--what was her <i>name</i> again? <i>Janet</i>? <i>Jill</i>? <i>Jo</i>? No--wait--<i>Jane</i>, yes, that was <i>it</i>--were on the <i>skids</i>? Sandi wondered if she should <i>ask</i> him <i>right</i> out, then <i>lost</i> her nerve at the last minute. She decided to wait for <i>later</i>, perhaps just before they--<i>kissed</i> to end the date, then go over to Quinn's tomorrow, and <i>rub</i> it in about being with her brother--<i>that</i> would teach her not to <i>challenge</i> Sandi's <i>authority</i>. She slowly smiled to herself and looked back out of her car door window, dreamily. <i>Oh, Darren--by the time you feel my kiss, you'll never want to go back to that "art geek weirdo" again</i>.</p>

     <p>Darren drove at a steady pace on the way back to Lawndale consumed by three things on his mind--<i>Sanchez, Sandi,</i> and <i>Quinn</i>. He was beginning to wonder if Woo could <i>ever</i> find him, and to end any and all speculation about who hired Sanchez to kill his parents. He began to feel <i>frazzled</i> by the <i>building</i> pressure on him--this was beginning to get more and more <i>unbearable</i> everyday. He wished he could be with <i>Jane</i> right now--she could take his mind <i>off</i> of all of this. Darren cut his eyes over at the <i>surprisingly</i> quiet Sandi, who was looking out of the window. <i>Good</i>--the <i>last</i> thing he needed was her saying <i>anything</i> right now to him about Quinn. In reality, Darren wanted to get <i>out</i> of that place when Quinn and Sandi had their little <i>"powerplay"</i>--he was <i>tired</i>, and simply wanted the date to end, but that "Mr. Shaw" and "Curly" would not <i>let</i> him leave, and he found himself <i>fighting</i>. He wondered about his recent <i>"drawing"</i> power when it came to <i>trouble</i>--it almost rivaled his <i>"girl-drawing"</i> power. First, that "Rocco" guy, then this "Curly" fellow--what was it about <i>him</i>? <i>Why</i> did it seem that <i>he</i> was some sort of <i>lightning rod</i> when it came to <i>trouble</i>?</p>

     <p><i>Quinn--why</i> did she <i>do</i> that? Daria and Jane were there, she didn't have to--he immediately <i>berated</i> himself over such a <i>simple</i> thought as that--to get <i>back</i> at Sandi, of course. If only she could have chosen <i>another</i> time--<i>anytime</i> to play her little <i>"games"</i> with Sandi, but <i>nooo</i>--it had to be <i>then</i> and <i>there</i>. If Quinn had not brought Stacy and Tiffany, the night would have gone smoother (and quieter), and he would have never been in that fight in the <i>first</i> place. He looked over at Sandi again. Perhaps he should say <i>something</i> to her--to stay quiet would be <i>rude</i>, even if it <i>was</i> this girl. He spoke in a tepid manner.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Glances over at her:)</i> Ah, uh, Sandi? About what happened back there--I'm <i>sorry</i> about--</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Smirks, looks over at him with a gleam in her eye:)</i> Like, it's <i>okay</i>, Darren--what you did was so <i>noble</i> an' stuff.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks surprised, thought v.o.: <b>Oh no</b>. She doesn't think that--)</i> Look, Sandi--perhaps we should get something <i>straight</i> here. I only shouted at Quinn like that to <i>stop</i> her from making the situation any <i>worse</i>. I did <i>not</i> take <i>your</i> side, if that's what you're thinking. Yes, I'll admit Quinn did come to the <i>Haven</i> and <i>instigated</i> the situation, but--</p> 

<p>SANDI: <i>(Still has the same smirk:) --Suuure</i> you didn't, Darren--<i>whatever</i> you say.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> You <i>don't</i> believe me?</p> 

<p>SANDI: <i>(Throws her hair back in a flippant manner:)</i> Like, you can be <i>honest</i> with me, Darren. <i>(Gives him a <b>"seductive"</b> look:)</i> You went <i>against</i> Quinn, your <i>own</i> sister, and took <i>my</i> side. That <i>alone</i> told me that you were <i>attracted</i> to me. <i>(Begins to slide <b>over</b> to Darren)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Wide-eyed, shocked, flinches as he sees her do so, but still controls the car:) WHAT</i>?! This <i>isn't</i> happening, it <i>can't</i> be. <i>(Glances back over at Sandi, trying like crazy to control his rising anger:)</i> Sandi-I-told-you-that-I-do-NOT-like-you! I have <i>Jane</i> as a girlfriend, remember?!</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Now stops sliding, looks at Darren, confused:)</i> But, don't you <i>like</i> me? I thought for <i>sure</i> after what happened tonight that you <i>did</i>!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks at her out of the corner of his eye:)</i> Where did <i>THAT</i> come from?! <i>(Thinks for a moment:)</i> Look, Sandi--is this about your thinking that I have <i>money</i> again? I'll admit that I, er, have <i>some</i>, but that's it, and--</p>


     <p>Sandi looked at Darren, actually <i>shocked</i>, or at least that what it seemed to Darren. She suddenly <i>sighed</i>, grew very quiet, then began to slide <i>back</i> to her side of the car. Darren was stunned by the sudden change in persona on Sandi's part. <i>Whoa--now what</i>? Darren did <i>not</i> expect that--a <i>trick</i> perhaps? He remembered what had Quinn told him about Sandi's <i>"habits"</i> of <i>tricking</i> people to get what she wanted (Quinn herself doing the same thing, of course)--maybe this was <i>one</i> of those times?</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(After a long moment:)</i> Er, Sandi? Are you all right? <i>(Grows quiet:)</i> Look, about the "money" crack--I'm <i>sorry</i> about saying--</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Now looks at Darren quietly:) --No</i>, it's <i>not</i> about the money, Darren--it's like, about what you just <i>said. (Looks away)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Frowns, looks perplexed:)</i> Eh? <i>"Said"</i>? What are you <i>talking</i> about? I'm <i>sorry</i>, but--</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Points at him:) --There</i>! <i>That</i>! What you said! <i>"Sorry"</i>!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Now even more confused:)</i> Huh? <i>"Sorry"</i>? I don't understand--</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Pouts, crosses her arms, looks ahead:)</i> --It's, like, you're, well--uh, so <i>nice</i> an' everything, an' so much of a <i>gentleman</i>. You never took <i>advantage</i> of me or anything while we were on th' dance floor, even though I gave you <i>every</i> chance to do so, an' stuff. You even, like, asked me about my <i>future</i> after high school an' everything. <i>(Pauses for her next words, speaks very low:)</i> No guy's <i>ever</i> been like that to <i>me</i>, you know? It's usually like, <i>"Backseat Time"</i>, an' I like, get <i>carried away</i> in th' moment, and we like, <i>make out</i>! But <i>you're</i> not like that! You're--you're--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Now finding himself suddenly interested:)</i> --I'm--I'm--<i>what</i>?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Looks down, red-faced:)</i> --you're really a <i>good</i> guy. You seem to like, <i>respect</i> me an' stuff. I just thought that maybe after what happened with Quinn, and the way you <i>beat</i> that muscled guy who <i>bullied</i> us, that you kind of <i>liked</i> me, by, like, <i>defending</i> us, that's all. <i>(Quickly looks everywhere but at a now-shocked Darren:)</i> I, well, I really <i>do</i> find myself liking you because of that. <i>Stupid</i>, huh? <i>(Adds:)</i> I guess Jane's, like, <i>lucky</i>, an' stuff, an' I'm <i>not. (Sighs)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(After a moment of getting over his shock:)</i> S-Sandi, I-I don't know <i>what</i> to say, except that, ah, uh--</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Cuts her eyes over at Darren, smirks:)</i> --That you're <i>"sorry"</i>, Darren?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles slightly while looking forward:) Yes</i>, I guess you <i>can</i> say that, Sandi. <i>(Sighs:)</i> But like I said, you can get <i>any</i> guy you want. <i>(Thought v.o.: Maybe after you've improved your <b>haughty</b> attitude, that is.)</i></p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Thought v.o. while looking out of the window: Yeah--just not <b>you</b>. [Smirks:] At least not <b>yet</b>. You're <b>everything</b> I could <b>hope</b> for in a guy, Darren--you're handsome, nice, smart, you can, like, <b>handle</b> yourself, an' you're probably <b>rich</b>. Jane's gonna find herself in a <b>battle</b> an' stuff, an' I plan to come out on <b>top</b> like I <b>always</b> do, an' really make Quinn <b>mad</b>, too--havin' her <b>brother</b> an' everything--I'll just, like, have to <b>bide</b> my time an' stuff.)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to William Appleton's apartment, the same time)</i></p>



     <p>William Appleton was up for a late-night conversation on his cell phone while propped up in his bed. He had several files strewn about on it, the <i>same</i> files he had collected from the coffee table that Benny had put back on after William had smacked him down on the floor. He was speaking to the man whom he had sent to Lawndale to spy on Darren.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Smirks:)</i>--That's right, ah--<i>Oscar</i>, right? I just got off the phone after talking to a <i>"Lt. Keller"</i> of the L.A.P.D., and he <i>"broke"</i> the news of Sanchez's death to me, and <i>"informed"</i> me of what he found concerning what Sanchez had done to cause the crash that killed my <i>"poor"</i> brother and sister-in-law, and of his <i>"suspicions"</i> that someone <i>"may have"</i> murdered them to somehow or another to get control of Appleton Industries. <i>(Laughs:)</i> The <i>fool</i> told me that I <i>wasn't</i> considered to be a suspect because I was <i>chosen</i> to be Chairman by my <i>"nephew"</i>, and thusly there was <i>no</i> motive for me to kill Arthur Sr. and Lucille--what an <i>idiot</i>--he didn't even say that <i>Woo</i> had to have told him about Sanchez, as if Lt. Keller and the L.A.P.D. <i>themselves</i> came up with the answers! I added that I would get in <i>"contact"</i> with my sister and <i>"nephew"</i> to let them know about the <i>"stunning"</i> news during this time also. I, in my <i>"grief"</i> and <i>"shock"</i>, also asked the good detective to ask his superiors to <i>wait</i> until <i>Monday</i> before announcing what Sanchez actually did to the media, so I could inform the Board and the stockholders of this <i>"incredible"</i> development. I've already called my secretary Lilly at her home, and told her that I'm going out of town for the next <i>few</i> days in a <i>private</i> location because I'm <i>"bereaved"</i>, and wouldn't be back until Monday morning. Benny and I will take <i>Norwood</i> with us, and slip out of town to this <i>"Lawndale"</i> and <i>join</i> you and the other men via <i>minivan</i>--no need to bring <i>attention</i> to ourselves by coming in on a private jet.</p>     

<p>OSCAR: Yessir. I've checked around this <i>"Lawndale"</i> just as you've said, Boss, and I think I've found the <i>isolated</i> spot you're looking for to <i>"deal"</i> with your <i>"nephew".</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Grins:)</i> Excellent, Oscar--where is it?</p>

<p>OSCAR: Near the <i>waterfront</i>, about <i>five</i> miles outside of the town. It's called <i>(pauses, is heard shifting some papers:)</i> the <i>Carter County Bay Warehouse District</i>, consisting of several old, huge, mostly-abandoned warehouses that are sitting by some docks, and are <i>innerconnected</i> with each other, which surround an inlet there. I sat there in my car for several <i>hours</i> yesterday after tailing Darren Appleton and his friends around, trying to see if anyone around here even knows if the place <i>exists</i>. It seems that the local <i>"Barney Fife"</i> cops don't come around here at <i>all</i>, so whatever you want to do with your <i>"nephew"</i>, you'll have <i>plenty</i> of time to do it.</p>

<p><i>(Note to reader: I'm taking the "waterfront" location from "Just Add Water", in case you're wondering, since it seems that Lawndale apparently is located near water because of that episode.)</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Sinister grin:) Excellent</i>, Oscar--I <i>knew</i> I could count on <i>you--(frowns, mumbles:)</i> unlike some <i>other</i> people.</p>

<p>OSCAR: Huh? What do you mean, Boss?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Sighs:) Never</i> mind, Oscar. Anyway, I'm <i>still</i> not going to take any chances--I want you on <i>top</i> of one of those warehouse roofs to act as a <i>lookout</i> when I get my <i>"nephew"</i> to <i>come</i> there. In the meantime, I'm going to put in <i>"Phase Two"</i> of my plan.</p>

<p>OSCAR: <i>"Phase Two"</i>, Boss?</p> 

<p>WILLIAM: Yes--to <i>lure</i> in his "birth family" to those warehouses. Based on the personal info you've given me concerning these--<i>"Morgendazzers"--</i></p>

<p>OSCAR: <i>(Gently interrupts:)</i> Uh, Boss, I think it's Morgen<i>DORFFERS</i>--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Rolls his eyes, talks through clenched teeth, looks down to his right side for some reason:)</i> --Morgen<i>DORFFERS</i>, Oscar, I think I know how to <i>reel</i> them in as <i>"insurance"</i> to get my <i>"nephew"</i> to sign over <i>everything</i> to me before I <i>kill</i> him.</p>

<p>OSCAR: How's that, Boss?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: You told me based on the information you acquired that my <i>"nephew's"</i> birth parents fit the <i>"workaholic"</i> mold when it comes to their careers, looking for an additional <i>"edge"</i> to get ahead, staying out <i>extra</i> hours to work, and such. I can use this to my advantage by appealing to that part of their careers. <i>(Pauses:)</i> You know, in a <i>way</i>, it's too <i>bad</i> they're my <i>"nephew's"</i> birth parents--I could <i>use</i> people like that to do <i>business</i> with, that is, with all of their <i>ambition</i> and such. <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Oh, well--</p>

<p>OSCAR: <i>(Snickers sinisterly:)</i> --I think I see what you're <i>planning</i>, Boss--<i>(pauses:)</i> what about their <i>daughters</i>, your <i>"nephew's"</i> birth sisters?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: I'll try to get them to come <i>along</i> with my <i>"nephew's"</i> birth parents--if I can't, then possibly <i>separately</i>. Either way, I want to try and have Darren's <i>whole</i> birth family there, as well--the more <i>"insurance"</i>, the better.</p>

<p>OSCAR: Does that include his <i>girlfriend</i>, too, Boss?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Amused look on his face:)</i> Oh, that's <i>right</i>--my <i>"nephew"</i> has a <i>new</i> girlfriend, too. <i>(In a sneering tone:)</i> Looks as if he's gotten over his <i>"Dear Stephanie"</i>, it seems. Well, if you can, get <i>her</i>, too.</p>

<p>OSCAR: Will do, sir--does this mean that you've decided to <i>eliminate</i> them <i>all</i> as well? There are an awfully <i>lot</i> of people we're dealing with, here, Boss--you know, <i>"loose ends"</i>, and all.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(After a moment:)</i> Hmm--yes, I've--<i>considered</i> that. Well, as I've told Benny, I've no <i>real</i> quarrel with these--<i>"Morgendeckers"--(looks down to his right side again:)</i> I mean, "Morgendorffers", despite the fact that they <i>"spawned"</i> Darren--or with his <i>girlfriend</i>, for that matter--they represent <i>no</i> threat to me. <i>(Pauses, ponders:)</i> I haven't <i>decided</i> on what to do with them yet <i>when</i> we get them. I'm probably going to still be deciding up until the <i>last</i> minute--have those <i>masks</i> and that <i>other</i> equipment ready for our men to help <i>"secure"</i> our <i>"insurance"</i> so they can't identify any of you when you take them. In the meantime, have you found a <i>very</i> low-key place for me to <i>stay</i> in this--<i>"Lawndale"</i>?</p>

<p>OSCAR: Sure, Boss--I got an <i>"ordinary-looking"</i> room at a <i>low-budget</i> motel called <i>Knight's Inn</i> that's only a mile-and-a-half from the warehouses. I thought about a place called the <i>Stopover Motel</i>, but it was a little <i>too</i> well-known around here, and you said you didn't want <i>anybody</i> to know that you're coming here.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: That's <i>right</i>--I don't. Good work, Oscar--you'll earn an <i>extra</i> bonus after this is over. Now, I'm going to put my <i>"plan"</i> in action. I'll call you tomorrow morning in the minivan and we'll go over any potential <i>flaws</i> we might see in the plan. Get some sleep, now.</p>

<p>OSCAR: Okay, Boss. <i>(Hangs up)</i></p>


     <p>William began to dial, but looked once again down to his right, to some files and a pad lying <i>beside</i> him. On the pad was the name <i>"Morgendorffer"</i>.</p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the Morgendorffer's, the same time)</i></p>



     <p>Helen and Jake were sitting in the living room on the center couch, leaning against each other, sighing contentedly, and drinking red wine with a lone lighted candle that was sitting in the middle of the coffee table. The evening had gone quite well. Jake had prepared a small dinner of cornish hens, and wild rice on the side, just large enough for him and Helen, and it was actually <i>delicious</i>. Both had a slice of cheesecake for dessert, and were now listening to <i>Mona Lisa</i> by Nat King Cole on a CD player that was sitting beside the cell phone on the coffee table.</p>


<p>HELEN: <i>(Dreamily:)</i> Oh Jake--isn't this wonderful? We have the house all to ourselves, Daria out with this <i>"Martin"</i> fellow, Darren out with Jane, and Quinn being over at <i>Stacy's</i>.</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Ditto:) Yeeeeah</i>--Ol' Nat on the CD, and you and me, sweetheart--what could be more romantic? <i>(Pauses, realizes:)</i> Uh, Helen, do ya think we ought to call the <i>Rowes</i> and <i>check up</i> on Quinn? You know, just to make sure everything's <i>okay</i>?</p> 

<p>HELEN: <i>(Surprised, looks up into Jake's eyes:)</i> Hmmm? Why, honey? Quinn's <i>safe</i> where she is with her friends. Let her <i>enjoy</i> herself, Jakey--she's <i>earned</i> it after <i>making up</i> with Daria.</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Yeah, I guess you're <i>right</i>, honey--our sweetie-pie's entitled to have some fun with her friends. <i>(Looks at his watch, cocks an eyebrow:)</i> Besides, it's kinda--<i>late</i>, anyway. I wouldn't want to wake 'em up if they're <i>sleeping</i>.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> Jake, it's a <i>slumber</i> party. Quinn and her friends could be up <i>most</i> of the night, and--</p>


     <p>The cell phone on the coffee table suddenly rang. Helen was about to reach for it when Jake gently <i>grabbed</i> her wrist. She looked at him, a bit surprised.</p>


<p>JAKE: Aw, <i>let</i> it ring, honey--it's probably that <i>"Eric"</i> guy calling you, and wanting you to come in tomorrow <i>morning</i>! <i>(Frowns:)</i> Why can't he just wait until <i>then</i> to call you?! I mean we're trying to have some <i>quiet</i> time here, and he decides to call on his damn <i>pet</i> to--<i>(turns pale:) oops</i>!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Frowns herself now:) --Ohhhh</i>--so I'm a <i>"pet"</i>, am I, Jake?</p> 

<p>JAKE: <i>(Suddenly nervous:)</i> O-oh <i>no</i>, sweetheart! I-I mean, well, uh--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Glares, cuts him off:)</i> --We'll <i>talk</i> about this, <i>later</i>, Jake. You know as well as I do that my job reqiures me to be ready at <i>any</i> time! This could be <i>one</i> of those times! Besides, it could Daria or Darren calling us for some <i>help</i> if their car <i>broke down</i>, or something. <i>(Turns off CD player, grabs phone on fourth ring, clicks it on, in her falsetto voice:) Hellooo</i>?</p>

<p>VOICE: <i>(Sounding "cheerful":)</i> Hello, is this the uh--<i>(pauses:) Mor-gen-dor-ffer</i> residence?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Sits up, while Jake sits back in the couch with a pout and an eye roll, arms crossed:)</i> Why, yes it is, Mr.--</p>

<p>VOICE: --<i>Smith--John Smith</i>. I'm sorry for calling so late, but I figured that I could catch you at this time.</p> 

<p>HELEN: <i>(Sounding slightly annoyed:)</i> Well, Mr. Smith, my husband and I <i>were</i> relaxing here at our home, and--</p>

<p>SMITH: <i>(Cuts her off gently:)</i> --I won't take up too much of your time tonight, Mrs. <i>(pauses:)</i> Mor-gen-dor-ffer, and please, call me <i>John</i>. I've been--<i>watching</i> you and your husband for a while from <i>afar</i>.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Cocks an inquisitive eyebrow:)</i> You've been--<i>"watching"</i> us, er--John? I'm afraid I don't <i>understand</i>, and please call <i>me</i> Helen.</p>

<p>SMITH: <i>(In an assuring tone:)</i> Please don't be <i>alarmed</i>, Helen. I meant that I've been watching your <i>work</i> you and your husband have been doing in your perspective careers, you as a <i>lawyer</i>, and he as an <i>marketing consultant</i>, and I must say, I am quite <i>impressed. (Pauses:)</i> I thought what happened on the <i>Van Reefs</i> case was a <i>travesty</i>, an utter and complete travesty. Your firm should have <i>won</i> that land case.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Now impressed in spite of herself:) Oooh</i>, well--thank you, John--<i>(frowns:)</i> those rich <i>bastards</i> had the <i>money</i> to get their way, and we couldn't <i>counter</i> that. <i>(Ponders:)</i> Now when I think about it, I wouldn't have been surprised if the Van Reefs <i>paid</i> the judge or some of the jurors off to help rule in their <i>favor</i>.</p>

<p>SMITH: <i>(After a pause:)</i> Of--<i>course</i>. Anyway, I also wanted to say that your husband--er, Jake, did a terrific job on that <i>eyeglass</i> account, too. <i>(Laughs:)</i> I like the ad slogan: <i>"An Eye For An Eye With Us"</i>! <i>Sheer</i> genius!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow, looks over at Jake:)</i> You <i>know</i> about my husband's <i>eyeglass</i> account? <i>(Jake now perks up at her, interested, goes over and listens to the phone next to Helen)</i> W-why, how did you <i>know</i> that, John?</p>

<p>SMITH: <i>(Chuckling sound:)</i> Like I said, Helen--I've <i>watched</i> you and your husband's remarkable work for some time, and I'd like to <i>meet</i> you and your <i>family</i>, if I could, or at least you and your husband, Jake. If you do, it could be very <i>lucrative</i> for <i>me</i>--er, I mean <i>all</i> of us. You see, I am an aspiring <i>inventor</i> that <i>inherited</i> a rather large amount of money from a dead <i>relative</i>, and I used most of the money to create a <i>"product"</i> that I want to share with you and your husband--it involves a <i>combination</i> of endorsing a <i>very</i> special, yet very <i>secret</i> product that I want to introduce to the public, with your husband's <i>expertise</i> in selling, and your <i>legal</i> opinions of--protecting my "product's" <i>copyrights</i> for when I show it to the <i>world. (Adds:)</i> My "product" is <i>so</i> secret, I can't discuss it over the phone. It could mean <i>millions</i> of dollars for you and your husband. If you're interested--</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Wide-eyed, and screams in the speaker part, while Helen winces from hearing Jake's scream in her ear:)</i> --YOU'RE <i>DAMN</i> RIGHT WE'RE INTERESTED!!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Frowns, covers the phone:)</i> JAKE, WILL YOU PIPE DOWN?! <i>(Jake cowers a bit, but still stays near the phone, listening, while Helen regains her composure, and uncovers the phone:)</i> Now, (ahem)--um, John--this all seems too <i>good</i> to be true--</p>

<p>SMITH: --I'm sure it <i>is</i>, Helen, and I don't <i>blame</i> you for having some <i>doubts. (Pauses:)</i> How about if I offer a <i>fee</i> for you and your husband just for coming out to <i>meet</i> me and viewing my "product"--say about <i>$25,000</i>?</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Before Helen can say anything:) $25,000</i>?! HELL YEAH, HELEN--<i>TAKE IT</i>!! <i>(Once again, Helen winces from Jake's screaming)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Through clenched teeth, warning tone, covers the speaker part:)</i> Damn it, Jake--DON'T-DO-THAT-AGAIN!! <i>(Jake jumps back in fear, while Helen goes back on the phone:)</i> I've uh, <i>"talked"</i> to my husband, John, and we're <i>definitely</i> interested--</p>

<p>SMITH: <i>(In a delighted tone:) --Spendid</i>! I'd like to arrange a meeting tomorrow <i>night</i> if that's all right--?</p>

<p>HELEN: Very well, John--is there some <i>restaurant</i> that you might want to go to here in Lawndale, or something--?</p>

<p>SMITH: Actually, Helen, I'd--like to--meet you all at a--<i>secret</i> location first, and look at my "product", then we can go to a restaurant, if that's okay with you. I'm--<i>protective</i> of it, you understand--is there any place you want to go after we meet each other?</p>

<p>HELEN: --Of course I understand, John, and we can then go to a place here called <i>Chez Pierre</i>--where do you want to meet us to see your "product"?</p>

<p>SMITH: At the <i>Carter County Bay Warehouse District</i>. I <i>know</i> we'll have <i>absolute</i> privacy there to--<i>"conduct"</i> our business.</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(While leaning over to the phone:)</i> Boy, <i>I'll</i> say! That place is almost <i>decrepit</i>! I've read that some <i>developer</i> plans to <i>bulldoze</i> everything and put up some <i>shops</i> and <i>homes</i> there--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Frowns, covers the speaker part again:)</i> Yes Jake--the <i>Van Reefs</i> own <i>part</i> of that land out there--<i>(mutters to herself:)</i> and just about every <i>other</i> damn thing around here. <i>(Resumes her normal voice on the phone after she uncovers it:)</i> We'll be there, John--what <i>time</i> do you want to meet?</p>

<p>SMITH: <i>(Pauses:)</i> Oh--how about <i>6:30 p.m.</i>, Helen? <i>(Adds:)</i> Er, do you think you and your husband will be able to bring your <i>family</i> there as well?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(After a moment:)</i> I'm--<i>not</i> sure. I think I heard that my son and middle daughter plan to go to a place called <i>McGrundy's</i> tomorrow night with a friend, but I'm sure my <i>youngest</i> daughter will come with us. She's <i>grounded</i>.</p>

<p>SMITH: <i>(Chuckling sound again:) Grounded</i> you say? Ah, yes--well, <i>children</i> will be children, I suppose. I'll see you all there, then. Goodnight.</p>

HELEN: We'll be there, John. Goodnight. (Hangs up)


     <p>Jake suddenly jumped around, and started to <i>dance</i> in a circle, then <i>grabbed</i> a <i>giggling</i> Helen, laughing, and spinning <i>her</i> around, as well.</p>


<p>JAKE: <i>(Grins like a fool:)</i> We're on our way, honey--we're on our <i>way</i>! YAHOO!! <i>(Thought v.o.: Now <b>"Mister High-And-Mighty"</b> Hopkins will get <b>his</b>!)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(While being spun around:)</i> I hope so, Jakey--if this pans out, I'm <i>sure</i> to get Eric's attention for that <i>partnership</i> at the firm! <i>(Thought v.o., smirks: <b>Linda's</b> sure to seethe after I rub this in her <b>damn</b> face)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the Griffin's, 30 minutes later)</i></p>



     <p>Darren's car pulled up to the front of the Griffin home, and he got out and went to the passenger side to hold open the door for a slightly smirking Sandi. Down the street, Helen's red SUV, with Daria, Jane, and Quinn inside, slowed to a crawl about two houses down, just in sight of the Griffin residence. Daria turned off the headlights so Sandi would not notice them. There was silence in the SUV for a moment, then Quinn spoke.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(Frowns:)</i> You guys know how all dates <i>end</i>, don't you? <i>(Pauses, smirks slowly:)</i> Well, I'm sure <i>Jane</i> knows at least. <i>(Daria gives a small glare in the interior rearview mirror at Quinn)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Narrows her eyes at the Griffin's, clenched teeth:)</i> Oh, <i>crap</i>--</p>

<p>DARIA: --Steady there, Lane. I'm sure Darren won't let Sandi <i>kiss</i> him.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> Unless she <i>surprises</i> him--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Wicked smirk, enjoys Jane's sqirming:)</i> --Like <i>you</i> did my bro at that weird <i>Zen</i> place? <i>(Now Jane glares at Quinn through the mirror)</i> I dunno--Sandi's pretty <i>slick</i> with her <i>tounge, (adds:)</i> if you know what I <i>mean</i>--</p>

<p>DARIA: --Oh, so <i>you've</i> experienced that <i>first</i> hand, sis? I didn't know you went <i>both</i> ways. <i>(Jane for once, does not smirk at Daria's barb, but still looks apprehensively at the Griffin residence, while Quinn looks at Daria wide-eyed and disgusted)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>EWWWWW</i>! That's <i>really</i> gross, Daria! I <i>meant</i>, I <i>heard</i> a guy <i>tell</i> me how she kissed! <i>(Pauses, then adds:) After</i> he went out with <i>me</i>, of course.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan, looks in the mirror at Quinn:)</i> So it's not only fashions and the amount of boys you both compete over, but now over who <i>kisses</i> the best? <i>(Smirks:)</i> What's <i>next</i>, who's gonna be better in <i>b--(sees Jane getting out of the SUV:)</i> Jane, where in the hell are you going?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Looks back through the passenger side window:)</i> Where do you <i>think</i>, Daria? This is her <i>last</i> chance, and she's gonna try <i>something</i>, I just <i>know</i> it! <i>(Leaves)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Narrows her eyes:)</i> Not with <i>my</i> bro, she isn't! <i>(Gets out and follows Jane)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: Uh, guys? <i>(Thought v.o.: Wonderful--now we're on a damn <b>reconnaissance</b> mission--too bad I didn't bring my <b>infra-red</b> goggles.) (Sighs, gets out and follows Jane and Quinn)</i></p>


     <p>Darren and Sandi came up to the door.</p>


<p>DARREN: Well, I hope you had a good time, my sister's little <i>"interruption"</i> notwithstanding, so if there's nothing <i>else</i>--? <i>(Starts to turn around to leave)</i></p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Alarmed, grabs Darren's shoulder:)</i> Uh, like, <i>wait</i>, Darren! <i>(Looks up at the starry night sky:)</i> It's like, a beautiful night, isn't it? The <i>moon</i> looks so <i>pretty</i> an' stuff. <i>(Begins to pucker her mouth up, thought v.o.: Just a little <b>closer</b>--)</i></p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Steals a glance at the sky, then at Sandi:)</i> Oh, uh, yes it is, Sandi
--all of those stars are making me feel--<i>tired</i>. Well, I've got to <i>go</i>, goodnight--<i>(starts to leave, again, this time goes down the walkway quickly)</i></p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Starts to frown, then:) DARREN</i>!! <i>(Darren flinches partway down the walk, slowly turns around)</i> I, like, think you should uh--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sighs heavily:) --Kiss</i> you to end the <i>"date"</i>, Sandi? <i>(Looks at her pointedly:)</i> You <i>know</i> I can't do that.</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Walks towards him in a <b>seductive</b> manner, smirks:)</i> And why <i>not</i>? Jane doesn't like, <i>have</i> to know.</p>


     <p>At the same time, Jane, Quinn, and Daria were standing behind some tall bushes a house down from the Griffins, watching and hearing the exchange. The girls began to speak in hushed tones, with Jane beginning the exchange.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Glares:)</i> But I <i>do</i> know--and I'll be <i>damned</i> if I'm gonna let that <i>tramp</i> kiss Darren!</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Ditto:)</i> You an' me <i>both</i>, Jane! I'm not gonna let Sandi rub <i>that</i> in my face!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan voice:)</i> You two <i>do</i> realize that if she sees <i>either</i> one of you, <i>especially</i> you again, Quinn, that she'll <i>kick</i> you <i>out</i> of the Fashion Club, and that all of the <i>begging</i> and <i>flattery</i> in the <i>known</i> universe won't change Sandi's mind in letting you back <i>in</i> this time? <i>(Looks at Jane:)</i> Jane, I think you should <i>trust</i> Darren's <i>judgement</i>, and let him handle this.</p>


     <p>Jane looked like she was about to say something to Daria, then looked down and sighed. Incidentally, Quinn glared at Daria for a second, then did the <i>same</i> thing.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>Damn</i>--you're <i>right</i>, Daria--you're right. I gotta <i>trust</i> Darren.</p>

<p>QUINN: This just makes me <i>so</i> mad--an' I can't do a <i>damn</i> thing except <i>watch</i> it! <i>(Crosses her arms, pouts, resumes watching with the others)</i></p>


     <p>Darren held Sandi out at arm's length, and spoke.</p>


<p>DARREN: No, but <i>I'd</i> know, Sandi--I couldn't face Jane and pretend to tell her that <i>nothing</i> happened <i>(thought v.o.: Especially since I <b>know</b> she's probably <b>watching</b> me right <b>now</b>.)</i> when something <i>did</i>. I couldn't, er--<i>live</i> with myself if we kissed.</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Rolls her eyes, stomps:) Damn it</i>, Darren--why do you haveta be so <i>straight</i> all of the time? It's just a <i>little</i> kiss! If she asks, you can, like, tell Jane that you wanted to like, uh, <i>end</i> the date on a <i>"positive"</i> note, or something or another! <i>(Jane and Quinn roll their eyes, while Daria watches impassively)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Narrows his eyes, speaks in a determined tone:) No</i>, Sandi--the deal was for a date, and I've <i>fulfilled</i> my end of the bargain. Goodnight. <i>(Turns around to leave)</i></p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Looks desperate, thought v.o.: If <b>this</b> doesn't work, <b>nothing</b> will.)</I> Darren, wait, I, <i>oooops--(suddenly faux stumbles forward to the ground)</i></p>


     <p>In a flash, Darren had grabbed Sandi around her waist, keeping her from falling, and she <i>leaned</i> against him to keep her balance, on his chest. Jane, Quinn, and now even <i>Daria</i> looked at the scene, wide-eyed, and surprised.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Alarm bells going off:) Ohhelldamnitall--(looks at Daria, exasperated:)</i> sorry, Daria, Quinn--but I can't allow <i>this--(starts to come out of the bushes)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Gasps at the scene, frowns:) Hell</i> no, I <i>don't</i> think so, Sandi! <i>(Begins to follow Jane, thought v.o.: I gotta try that <b>myself</b> on a date!)</I></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> And all <i>hell</i> promptly breaks loose. I hope Quinn enjoys <i>beauty school. (Begins to follow both through the bushes)</i></p>


     <p>Simultaneously, Darren's face was only <i>inches</i> from Sandi's. He looked at her wide-eyed. <i>Darren, you idiot! You should've known this was a <b>trick</b>!</i> Sandi smirked wickedly--she had him just where she <i>wanted</i> him.</p>


<p>SANDI: <i>(Closes her eyes, thought v.o.: You're <b>mine</b>, Darren! <b>Pucker up</b>!) (Begins to close the remaining distance)</i></p>


     <p>Suddenly, the front door of the Griffin's residence opened, and <i>Tom Griffin</i> stood in the doorway in his pajamas and housecoat, frowning. Jane and Quinn stopped in their tracks when they saw Mr. Griffin, doing it so fast, Daria almost <i>stumbled</i> over both of them. Both Quinn and Jane looked at each other foolishly, then went back into the bushes, <i>dragging</i> a surprised Daria <i>back</i> with them on each arm, then resumed their watching. Mr Griffin started to speak as he walked down the small walkway to Darren and Sandi.</p>


<p>MR. GRIFFIN: <i>(Looks incensed, but struggles to actually <b>appear</b> to be:)</i> And um--just <i>what</i>, pray tell, were you <i>doing</i> with my daughter, young man?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Wide-eyed, gently pushes Sandi away from him:)</i> Er, ah, it's not what it looks like, Mr. Griffin, really! You see, your daughter fell forward, and--</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Cuts him off, glares at her father:) Fatheeer</i>! You like, <i>ruined</i> a <i>private</i> moment, here! Would you like, <i>leave</i> us alone now, <i>(pauses, smirks:)</i> or should I like, get <i>mother</i> to come out here, an' stuff?</p>


     <p>For the tiniest instant, Tom Griffin turned <i>pale</i>--for the <i>tiniest</i> instant, that is. He then frowned even <i>more</i> deeply, and turned a <i>very</i> deep shade of <i>purple</i>, something both Darren and Sandi caught onto <i>extremely</i> quickly.</p>


<p>MR. GRIFFIN: <i>(Roars, points to the open front door:)</i> SANDI FELICIA GRIFFIN, GET YOUR ASS IN THE HOUSE THIS INSTANT! <i>(Sandi is stunned at his outburst, then sheepishly goes by her scowling father, only to stop at the doorway, turn around, and give Mr. Griffin a cold glare) (In the bushes, Quinn is trying like <b>crazy</b> not to <b>bust out</b> laughing, but is just <b>barely</b> doing so, thanks to Daria and Jane holding their <b>hands</b> over her mouth and <b>her</b> while watching Darren and Mr. Griffin)</i></p>

<p><i>(Note to reader: Hey, I'm only <b>guessing</b> Sandi's middle name, here!)</i></p>

<p>SANDI: We'll see what happens <i>tomorrow</i> when <i>mother</i> finds out what you've <i>done</i>, Father. <i>(Looks at Darren, her face softens a bit:)</i> Goodnight, Darren--I really <i>did</i> have a good time with you tonight. Perhaps we can do it <i>again</i> some time. <i>(Turns around, goes into the house and saunters cooly up the stairs)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Thought v.o., sighs, watches her go up: Not in <b>this</b> lifetime, or any <b>other</b> one, if I can help it.)</i></p>


     <p>Mr. Griffin gave a very relieved sigh of his <i>own</i>, and turned to a now-<i>worried</i> Darren.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Holds up his hands:)</i> Uh, Mr. Griffin, I know you might not believe me, but I <i>swear</i> I did <i>not</i>--</p>

<p>MR. GRIFFIN: <i>(Breaks out into a slow smile:)</i> --It's <i>okay</i>, Darren--I <i>believe</i> you.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Dumbfounded beyond belief:) Whaaaat</i>? But--but--</p>

<p>MR. GRIFFIN: <i>(Smirks:)</i> I <i>sneaked</i> out of bed and waited downstairs for the two of you to come in. I've been watching the <i>whole</i> scene since you two came up to our home. I figured you needed a <i>break</i> from my daughter's--er, <i>"advancements"</i>, sort to speak.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Now regains his senses:)</i> I--don't--understand, Mr. Griffin. Why--</p>

<p>MR. GRIFFIN: --Why did I do what I did? <i>(Grows quiet:)</i> Well, son, it's like this--my wife basically <i>runs</i> this house. I suspected you probably <i>guessed</i> this was <i>true</i> when you came here for Sandi tonight, am I right? <i>(Darren looks uncomfortable, says nothing)</i> Well, it's the <i>truth</i>, I might as well <i>admit</i> it--Linda basically makes <i>all</i> of the decisions here, and I'm just a <i>stooge. (Smirks:)</i> I'll just <i>bet</i> that your birth father <i>Jake</i> is more in <i>"control"</i> of <i>his</i> home than I am. <i>(Darren holds his tounge, though it's quite a <b>challenge</b> for him to do so, while Quinn snorts, and Jane and Daria smirk)</i> Anyway, my daughter basically is a <i>spoiled brat</i>, even <i>more</i> so than my two sons, thanks to my wife. Sandi gets her way with <i>everyone</i>, save Linda, <i>(sighs:)</i> including <i>me</i>. My daughter, as you've just witnessed, has at times even <i>used</i> Linda as a sort of <i>"shield"</i> against me. <i>(Quinn gasps in surprise, smirks some more, while Daria and Jane shrug)</i> Generally, when she comes home late on a date, I don't say <i>anything</i> because I know Linda will take <i>her</i> side, saying <i>(in a slightly bitter tone:)</i> that Sandi's <i>"responsible enough"</i>. I'd tell you <i>why</i> this is so, but it's kind of--long and--<i>complicated. (Pauses, looks at Darren, frowns in thought:)</i> Tonight, however, I decided to make an <i>exception</i> in <i>your</i> case. You looked as if you <i>didn't</i> want to be here, correct? <i>(Darren slowly nods in the affirmative)</i> Ah, good--I wondered why you looked sort of <i>depressed</i> tonight when you came to pick up my daughter. I wanted to <i>ask</i> you out of curiousity, but <i>Linda</i> was there, and I couldn't. Sandi's been <i>raving</i> about you around our dinner table since she first saw you with your--<i>cou</i>--er, no, that's not quite right--<i>sister</i> Quinn at that pizza place she goes out to with her Fashion Club friends. I've <i>never</i> seen her go on about a young fellow like she did about <i>you</i>, Darren. <i>(Darren cocks a surprised eyebrow, while Jane and Quinn look at each other shocked, and Daria simply continues to look at the scene impassively)</i></p> 

<p>DARREN: Ah, don't take what I confirmed to you <i>wrong</i> about not wanting to go out with your daughter tonight, Mr. Griffin--as I told Sandi, she could have <i>any</i> guy she wants--it's just that I <i>already</i> have a girlfriend that <i>(raises his voice a tad louder to enable Jane to hear)</i> I like <i>very</i> much <i>(Jane gives a contented smirk, while Quinn rolls her eyes, and Daria continues to look impassive)</i>, and I'm kind of <i>eager</i> to get back to her after I leave here tonight.</p> 

<p>MR. GRIFFIN: Of course, Darren--though I am <i>curious</i> to know one thing--<i>why</i> did you go out <i>with</i> my daughter tonight if you <i>already</i> have a girlfriend?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(After a moment, sighs:)</i> Well, Mr. Griffin--I basically did it to keep my sister Quinn <i>in</i> the Fashion Club--<i>(Quinn looks down a bit red-faced, a little ashamed, while Jane glares at her for a moment, and Daria continues her impassive look)</i> your daughter would've kicked her <i>out</i> if I didn't. Actually, you just <i>said</i> the reason yourself without <i>realizing</i> it--that Quinn is Daria's and mine's <i>sister</i>, and not cousin. Sandi, your wife, and my birth mother found out about it this week while we were eating at that <i>Milligan's</i> place. Sandi was about to use Quinn's--er, <i>lie</i> as an excuse to do the deed.</p> 

<p>MR. GRIFFIN: <i>(Nods:)</i> Ah, <i>now</i> I'm beginning to understand what's going on here--Linda seemed quite <i>excited</i> about your going out on this <i>"date"</i> with Sandi--<i>(ponders:)</i> I wonder if Linda <i>knew</i> what Sandi was <i>up</i> to?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Speculates privately, tempted to say "yes", but shrugs instead:)</i> I don't know, sir--I'm just glad that it's <i>over</i> for tonight--<i>(hastily adds:)</i> no offense against your daughter again, sir.</p>

<p>MR. GRIFFIN: And none <i>taken</i> again, Darren. <i>(Hesitates:)</i> You know, it's too <i>bad</i> in a way--I kind of would've <i>liked</i> to have have a </i>nice</i> young man such as yourself date my daughter--<i>(Darren, Jane, Quinn, and now even Daria shudder at that thought)</i> you seemed to really <i>get</i> to Sandi like no other fellow as I've said--making her seem--<i>nicer. (Smirks:)</i> Are you <i>sure</i> I can't <i>change</i> your <i>mind</i> about dating her some <i>more</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Wide-eyed, starts to back up slowly:)</i> Uh, ah, that's <i>quite</i> all right, Mr. Griffin--<i>(looks at watch:)</i> boy, look at the <i>time</i>! Well, I've <i>got</i> to go, sir! <i>(Turns around quickly, starts almost <b>running</b> to his car)</i></p>

<p>MR. GRIFFIN: Wait, son, I was just kid--<i>(cuts himself off, sighs, thought v.o.: Well, <b>partially</b> kidding, anyway.) (Turns around, goes inside his house, shuts the door)</i></p>


    <p>Darren quickly came to his car, and took the keys from his pocket so <i>fast</i>, he <i>fumbled</i> with them, and dropped them on the street. He sighed, and squatted down to pick them up. As he grabbed them and rose back up, he saw Daria, Quinn, and Jane come out to the car from behind the bushes. He smiled when he saw them, going over.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Hugs Jane, relieved:) God</i>, am I glad to see you all! </p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks wickedly at him with her arms around his neck:)</i> Likewise. <i>(Suddenly gives him a quick kiss on the lips, while Quinn rolls her eyes, disgusted, and Daria gives a quick smirk)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Recovers, smiles down at Jane:)</i> I'm certainly not complaining, but what was <i>that</i> for?</p> 

<p>JANE: <i>(Ponders playfully for a moment:)</i> Call it--the <i>"official"</i> end of your <i>"date"</i> with Sandi, only <i>I'm</i> the one giving you the <i>"closure"</i>, and <i>not</i> Sandi.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Fine by me. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Eh--about what <i>happened</i> in front of the Griffins, when Sandi, ah, <i>"stumbled"</i> into me--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Waves him off, dismissive:) Ahhh</i>--no sweat. I <i>wasn't</i> worried in the <i>least</i>!</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Comes up with Daria:)</i> Neither was <i>I</i>, bro--I <i>knew</i> you wouldn't fall for Sandi's tricks! <i>(Daria gives both girls her <b>"Give me a break"</b> look)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Frowns slightly:)</i> I see <i>you're</i> here, Quinn--let me guess--Stacy and Tiffany let you <i>down</i> in your <i>"hour of need"</i>, and you're so <i>angry</i> with them, you decided to ride back here with Daria and Jane.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Now sheepish:)</i> Uh, yeah, you <i>could</i> say that. <i>(Sighs, glances over at Daria, looks down:)</i> Um, Darren, I'm--<i>sorry</i> for comin' out there tonight an' almost <i>ruinin'</i> my chance to stay in th' Fashion Club. It was--<i>stupid</i> an' <i>dumb</i> to do so, and I hope you can <i>forgive</i> me. <i>(Suddenly brushes past a surprised Jane, and hugs Darren tightly:) Please</i> don't <i>stay</i> mad at me!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Surprised, pats her lightly on the back while seeing Daria and Jane give <b>monumental</b> eye-rolls, sighs:) Okay</i>, Quinn--okay, you're <i>forgiven</i>! <i>(Holds her from him, looks down at her pointedly:)</i> Just <i>promise</i> me that you won't do something <i>foolish</i> like that again, okay? <i>(Quinn eagerly nods)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:) "Promises, promises"</i>. If <i>Dionne Warrick</i> were <i>dead</i>, she'd be turning in her <i>grave</i> by now--but since she's still <i>alive</i>, she's just <i>turning</i>--her <i>stomach</i> would be anyway--just like <i>mine</i> is right now. <i>(Quinn glares at Daria, while Jane smirks, and Darren tries not to laugh)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Now, now, Daria--<i>(looks back down to Quinn:)</i> and I owe <i>you</i> an apology, too--I'm sorry for <i>snapping</i> at you like that on the dance floor. I just--<i>(pauses:)</i> was <i>tired</i>, and I didn't want you and Sandi to go at it again. <i>(Gives a quick smile:)</i> Can <i>you</i> forgive <i>me</i> for that?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Giggles with that singy-songy sound, squeezes Darren, lays her head against his chest:)</i> Of <i>course</i> I can, silly!</p> 

<p>DARIA: Well, now that we've had our share of sentimental <i>crap</i>, can we go <i>home</i> now? It's getting <i>awfully</i> damn late. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Jane and I have some um--<i>"personal stuff"</i> to do first thing tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> We <i>do</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Narrows her eyes slightly:) Yes</i>, Jane--we're going to look <i>into</i> something tomorrow, <i>remember</i>?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Now remembers:)</i> Oh <i>yeah</i>--tomorrow! <i>(Looks sheepishly between Darren and Daria:)</i> I--guess--I won't, um, be able to have our now-customary jog tomorrow morning, Darren?</p>


     <p>Darren and Quinn looked at each other, confused for a moment, then Darren spoke.</p>


<p>DARREN: Uh, <i>oookay</i>--I'll take a <i>raincheck</i> on that then, Jane. Will you two need any er, <i>help</i> with your, ah, <i>"personal stuff"</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: Nope, bro, we'll be fine, but thanks for inquiring anyway. <i>(Quickly leaves, but grabs Quinn's arm:)</i> Come on, <i>"sis"</i>, and let's get on home. We can't forget that our bro here is supposed to be out with <i>Jane</i>, and I've gotta <i>"smuggle"</i> you home under mom and dad's <i>noses</i> if they're not asleep already. We'll see you guys later. <i>(Leaves with Quinn to the SUV)</i></p>


     <p>Darren and Jane watched watched them get into the SUV and leave.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> Why would Daria need to <i>"smuggle"</i> Quinn home, Jane?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:)</i> I'll explain while you're taking me home, Darren.</p>


     <p>Darren opened the passenger-side door for Jane, and then got in on his side, and then drove off. Unknown to them, <i>Sandi</i> had witnessed the scene (including seeing Daria and Quinn) from her street-facing dark bedroom. She narrowed her eyes for a moment, <i>deeply</i> frowned, then changed into her nightgown, and got into bed.</p>


<p><i>(Scene is the Morgendorffer's, a few minutes later)</i></p>


     <p>Daria drove the SUV into the driveway and turned off the headlights. Quinn became a <i>nervous wreak</i> when she saw that the lights were <i>still</i> on in the living room.</p>


<P>QUINN: <i>(Bites her lip:) Gaaawd</i>! Why do mom an' dad <i>still</i> haveta be <i>up</i>? <i>(Narrows her eyes at Daria, warning stare:)</i> You'd better keep <i>your</i> end of the <i>bargain</i>, Daria--if they <i>catch</i> me dressed like <i>this</i>, an' <i>not</i> at Stacy's--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sighs:) --Relax</i>, sibling--I told you that I would get you in without them seeing you, and I will. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I guess you weren't <i>really</i> serious when you apologized to Darren for making a <i>fool</i> out of yourself earlier this evening at that nightclub.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(After a moment:) Daaaaria</i>--I <i>was</i> serious about apologizin' an' stuff, an' I know I did the <i>right</i> thing 'cause Darren apologized to <i>me</i> for <i>snappin'</i> at me in front of Sandi. <i>(Looks down, grows quiet:)</i> I guess that old sayin' about <i>"One good thing deserves another"</i> is <i>true</i>.</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> Quinn, it's--<i>(sighs:)</i> never mind. C'mon, let's get out. <i>(Gets out with Quinn, goes up to the door:)</i> Now, I'm gonna go in first, but I'll leave the door unlocked and <i>barely</i> open for you to sneak in after I <i>distract</i> mom and dad. Keep an eye out, now. <i>(Unlocks door, goes in, while Quinn peeps through the crack in the door)</i></p>


     <p>Daria took a quick deep breath and walked into the living room, where she saw Helen doing some work, while Jake was nodding on the couch watching the TV. Both got up when they saw her. Instead of stopping, however, Daria <i>kept</i> walking.</p>


<p>HELEN: <i>(Surprised tone:)</i> Daria? Is something wrong, sweetie? Why aren't you <i>stopping</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Still walks:)</i> Can't stop. Thirsty. Follow me into the kitchen, and I'll give you the <i>lowdown</i> about the date. <i>(Helen and Jake look at each other for a second, and follow Daria into the kitchen, while Quinn takes the opportunity to slip in when they do so, and tiptoes upstairs to her room.)</i></p>


     <p>Daria went to the refrigerator to get a can of soda while Helen and Jake <i>eagerly</i> sat down at the table to await hearing their daughter's account of something that both of them knew all too well happens <i>rarely</i>--their oldest daughter had gone on a <i>date</i> with a boy. Daria opened the soda and leaned against the counter while drinking.</p>


<p>HELEN: All right, sweetie--your father and I are waiting--<i>how</i> was your date?</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Frowns, jumps in:) Yeah</i>--and did the <i>punk</i> put his <i>hands</i> in places on you where they <i>shouldn't</i> have been, Kiddo? <i>(Eyes turn red, dangerous tone:)</i> Because if he <i>did</i>, I'll <i>destroy</i> his--</p>

<p>HELEN: --JAKE!</p> 

<p>JAKE: <i>(Smiles suddenly:)</i> I'm <i>calm</i>, honey! How'd the date go, Kiddo?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shrugs, takes a sip of soda:)</i> We went to a place <i>outside</i> of Carter county. It was <i>dull--"Martin"</i> and I just weren't <i>compatible</i> with each other--he, um--just talked about his <i>computers</i> and <i>web sites</i> the whole date. I listened politely, occasionally adding my <i>"world-renowned"</i> wit and humor in between, and that was that. I dropped him back off at his <i>"place"</i>, and then I came home.</p> 

<p>HELEN: But sweetie, it's so <i>late</i>! You mean to tell us that's <i>all</i> there was to the date, him talking about <i>computers</i> and <i>web sites</i> up until you took him home?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Finishes her soda:)</i> Yep--sorry. <i>(Faux yawn:)</i> Boy, I'm <i>exausted</i>--these <i>"dates"</i> really <i>wear</i> a gal <i>out</i>--good thing I don't go on too <i>many</i> of them. <i>(Starts to leave the kitchen:)</i> Goodnight--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Hold on, sweetie--your father and I have some <i>wonderful</i> news we've received while you and Darren were out--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> --Quinn's <i>moving out</i>? <i>(Helen rolls her eyes)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: No, Kiddo! Your mom and I are gonna hit it <i>rich</i> tomorrow! <i>(Helen glares a little at Jake, which he notices)</i> Uh, I <i>hope</i> we will, at least.</p>

<p>DARIA: You're gonna <i>rob</i> a bank? A <i>relative</i> died and left you some money? Quinn's <i>beauty tips</i> actually are gonna become <i>crappy</i> best sellers for a <i>idiot</i> publisher who's decided to sign her to a long-term book contract?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Shakes her head:)</i> No, no, Daria! <i>(Sighs:)</i> We'll tell you, Darren, and Quinn tomorrow. If it works out, you and Quinn will be able to go to college <i>without</i> the financial <i>burdens</i> of tuition to worry about--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(As she begins to walk out:)</i> Funny--I thought <i>"financial burdens"</i> were for the <i>parental units</i> to worry about--we of the <i>offspring society</i> just are supposed to concern ourselves with <i>bumming</i> money off from the parental units while attending the aforementioned higher institute of learning. This is <i>quite</i> a <i>new</i> development, here--I'll have to <i>comtemplate</i> this while I happily dream of <i>new</i> ways to <i>torture</i> Quinn. <i>(Leaves while Jake looks confused, and Helen rests her head in her hand on the table, sighs in an exasperated manner)</i></p> 


     <p>Daria went upstairs, and was about to go in her padded room, when she saw Quinn quickly peek out from her own room, curious.</p>


<p>QUINN: Did mom and dad suspect anything, Daria?</p>

<p>DARIA: You're still <i>alive</i>, aren't you? Relax--you're safe and secure in your own little bedchamber now--<i>(adds:)</i> of course, if Stacy or Tiffany suddenly <i>call</i> you tonight to <i>beg</i> for your <i>forgiveness</i>, and mom and dad happen to <i>answer</i> the phone, then I'd consider making out a <i>last will and testament. (Smirks, goes into her room)</i></p>


     <p>Quinn suddenly gasped, turned <i>pale</i>, and slowly went back into her room, privately <i>terrified</i>.</p> 

     <p>Darren drove up to the Morgendorffers having dropped off Jane at her home. He got out of his car, and using the key Jake had gotten him, came into the living room. Darren gave a quick look around--there was no <i>shouting</i>, so he assumed that Quinn was successfully <i>"smuggled"</i> in by Daria. Helen and Jake were coming out of the kitchen when they saw him.</p>


<p>HELEN: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Oh, Darren--how was your date with <i>Jane</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Uneasy tone, shrugs:)</i> Oh, uh, it was ah--<i>fine</i>, Helen, Jake--just your <i>standard</i> date, nothing to write home about. We ate at a restaurant, went to the movies, and so-and-so. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Er, I saw the SUV in the driveway when I came in, which I'm assuming means that Daria's here from <i>her</i> date. Jane and I were <i>eager</i> to know how it went.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Sighs:)</i> It was quite <i>dull</i>, son, according to Daria at least, and--</p>

<p>JAKE: --Boy, first <i>Daria</i> has a <i>dull</i> date with that <i>"Marty"</i> fellow, and then you say you and Jane had a <i>"standard"</i> date, son? <i>(Starts getting into rage mode, frowns, while Helen and Darren give each other uncomfortable looks:) Ohhhh</i>--when I was about your's and Daria's age, I knew how to have a <i>good</i> time on <i>my</i> dates! The <i>Old Man</i> wanted me to stay under his <i>thumb</i>, but I <i>showed</i> him! I <i>sneaked</i> out at night, and went to the <i>drive-ins, dance halls</i>, and <i>all</i> the <i>damn</i> make-out points! <i>(Gets a deranged look, which spooks Darren a bit:)</i> Ol' <i>"Mad Dog"</i> couldn't stop me until he sent me to that <i>damn</i> military school, and--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Rolls her eyes:) --Enough</i>, Jake! <i>(Jake immediately does)</i> Darren, your father and I have some <i>fantastic</i> news we want to share with you and the girls tomorrow. When Quinn comes in then, we'll tell you. <i>(Gasps:)</i> Oh, dear--I almost forgot to tell you that a <i>(looks up:) "Mr. Gerald"</i> called concerning a <i>"G.W. about <b>Sanchez</b>". (Darren's eyes are now huge)</i> He said you'd <i>know</i> what the message is all about.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Mouth agape, walks up to Helen and puts his hands on her shoulders, excited:)</i> About <i>"Sanchez"</i>? <i>(Looks down at her pointedly:)</i> Are you <i>sure</i>?</p>

<p>HELEN: Why, yes, son, I'm sure, but what--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Now begins to rush up the stairs:)</i> --I'll tell you two <i>later</i>! I <i>promise</i>! <i>(Goes up and out of sight while Helen and Jake look at each other, confused)</i></p>


     <p>Darren rushed into his room and grabbed his cell phone, only pausing long enough to take out the business card that Woo had given him while Darren had visited Woo's office earlier this month. Darren guessed that Woo <i>wasn't</i> at work since it was so late here (and on the West coast as well), so Darren was going to try Woo's <i>home</i> number first, then if Woo wasn't there, then his <i>pager</i> number. <i>Finally, a break. Perhaps the nightmare of living the <b>lie</b> would be over</i>. He glanced at the card long enough to ascertain what numbers he'd need to call, then punched the numbers.</p>


     <p>In his apartment, a <i>rumpled</i>-dressed Gerald Woo leaned against the wall in his living room, staring out of the window at the distant nighttime skyline of Los Angeles depressed through a <i>drunken</i> stupor, thanks to a bottle of <i>Chablis</i> white wine that was sitting on the floor beside him, and with <i>good</i> reason, at least to him. He had let <i>down</i> his client, and was made to look like a <i>fool</i> in the process. One of the <i>oldest</i> tricks in the book, and he <i>fell</i> for it. <i>What an <b>fool</b> you are, Woo. Maybe you should just <b>advertise</b> your <b>stupidity</b> to every potential client in the city and to the whole damn world. You were <b>used</b>, you <b>moron</b>, the very thing that you're supposed to <b>avoid</b>, and you walked right <b>into</b> it.</i></p> 

     <p>Woo poured another glass of the wine, and was about to take another drink, when the cell phone on his sofa rang. Woo <i>stared</i> at the phone for a <i>long</i> moment. He <i>knew</i> for some reason it <i>had</i> to be his client <i>Darren Appleton</i>, a client who was expecting to hear some <i>good</i> news about Sanchez. Woo <i>dreaded</i> answering the phone, but he knew he <i>had</i> to. He had to tell his client the <i>truth</i>. He sighed heavily for a second, <i>staggered</i> over to the sofa, then gripped the phone tightly, and clicked it on following the <i>sixth</i> ring. He <i>clenched</i> his teeth when he heard Darren's <i>excited</i> voice.</p>


<p>DARREN: Woo? <i>Hey</i>! For a moment there, I thought you <i>weren't</i> home! You left me a message about <i>Sanchez</i>! Please tell me you have <i>good</i> news!</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Gathers up his wits, speaks in a bit of a <b>slurred</b> tone of voice:)</i> Uhh, Daarren? II--have ssoome <i>bad</i> news--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(In a dreaded tone:) --Oh, no</i>--Woo, what <i>happened</i>? <i>(Pauses:)</i> Say, you don't <i>sound</i> right--is something wrong--<i>(now in a very stunned low voice:)</i> have you--have you been <i>drinking</i>?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Frowns:)</i> Neeever <i>mind</i> that, Daaaren! II juust have to tell you II've <i>failed</i> you! SSanchez iss <i>dead</i>!</p>


     <p>There was a <i>very</i> long silence on the other end.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(In a low voice:)</i> Woo, what did you say? S-Sanchez is <i>dead</i>?</p> 

<p>WOO: Yeess, Daaarren--I <i>failed</i> you. II waas <i>trrricked</i>. My offfice was <i>bbuuuged</i>.</p> 

<p>DARREN: Your office was <i>bugged</i>, Woo? Do you have <i>any</i> idea <i>who</i> did it or who could've murdered Sanchez?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Tries to stay coherent:)</i> Nnnoo, weee don't, Daaarren--II'm <i>sssorry</i>. III must loook like a d-d-damn <i>foool</i> to yooou. II d-did my b-best, annd I acc--acce--<i>take</i> full resp--respon--reshib--<i>blame</i>. Ifff yoooou want to <i>f-f-fire</i> me, III'll <i>understand</i>. T-the <i>p-pooolice</i> are i-inveestigating now.</p>


     <p>There was <i>another</i> very long silence on the other end.</p> 


<p>DARREN: <i>(Sighs:)</i> Woo--look, uh--maybe you should <i>sleep</i> this off, and maybe you can, ah, call sometime <i>tomorrow. (Pauses:)</i> I don't know if hearing this will do any good, especially in your--ah, <i>condition</i>, but, you--you did your <i>best</i>, and you can't <i>blame</i> yourself--</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Cuts him off:)</i> --Ooooh, yes III <i>can</i>, Daaaarren! III <i>s-s-screwed</i> it up! III waas an iji--idi--<i>idiot</i>!</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(In a very quiet voice:)</i> Uh, goodnight, Woo. <i>(Hangs up)</i></p>

<p>WOO: Waaaait! Dooon't you shang--hang up ooon me, Daaarrren--<i>(gets quiet himself:)</i> dooon't--hang--up. <i>Damn. (Pauses for a moment, then <b>drops</b> the phone on the floor, and plops down on the sofa, leans back, and deeply sighs, stares at the ceiling, then suddenly <b>passes out</b>.)</i></p>



     <p>Darren sat down on his bed, shocked beyond words. Sanchez was--<i>dead</i>? Woo had apparently been--<i>drinking</i> out of <i>guilt</i> that he could not stop it? What in the <i>world</i> was going on? He looked down at the floor for a moment, feeling <i>completely</i> at a <i>loss. Who</i> could he turn to now? As far as he could tell, Woo said that the <i>police</i> were on the case now. What would that <i>mean</i>? Darren couldn't be sure if he could trust <i>anyone</i> outside of the Morgendorffers, Jane, Curtis, his aunt Millie, Elenor, or Claude--even his <i>uncle Will</i>--certainly he couldn't <i>drag</i> any of them into this--everything had been riding on Sanchez being captured--<i>now, however</i>... perhaps he <i>should</i> call the police and tell what <i>he</i> knew, since they knew about Sanchez? It would expose <i>risking</i> attention, or at the least, provide <i>protection</i> for Jane, his birth family, and friends, after he talked to the police, and told them his story. If whoever killed Sanchez came after <i>him, fine</i>. Just as long as they wouldn't go after the <i>others--</i></p>

     <p>His cell phone rung on its own, and Darren wondered for a moment whether Woo was calling him <i>back</i> to try and <i>explain</i> what had happened--he <i>hoped</i> not--as far as Darren could tell, Woo was <i>out</i> of it. Darren turned on the phone.</p>


<p>DARREN: Hello?</p>

<p>VOICE: Ah, hello, nephew. I didn't mean to <i>wake</i> you.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Cocks eyebrow in surprise:) Uncle Will</i>? You're the <i>last</i> person I would expect to call here! No, you didn't wake me--I just got back from a--<i>"date"</i>. I was going to call you about the NTSB's report from this week concerning the crash--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Cuts him off:)</i> --Good, very good--uh, I don't know how I can break this <i>news</i> to you, Darren, it's <i>strange</i>, but since you were going to tell me about the crash, there's something I <i>have</i> to tell you--<i>(faux dramatic pause:)</i> it--<i>wasn't</i> an accident.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Stunned, narrows eyes:) How</i>--how did <i>you</i> know it <i>wasn't</i> an accident, Uncle Will?</p>  

<p>WILLIAM: Why, the <i>police</i> told me when they <i>called</i> me earlier tonight, my boy. They said that the <i>killer</i> of your--<i>parents</i> was <i>murdered</i>. They added something about a <i>sabataged</i> fuel line. <i>(Pauses, faux surprise:) Hold it</i>--how did <i>you</i> know it wasn't an accident, Darren? Did the police call <i>you</i>, too?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(A little sheepish:)</i> Uh, <i>not</i> exactly, Uncle Will. <i>(Sighs:)</i> Well, since the police told you what happened, I'll fill you in on what <i>I</i> know--</p>


     <p>Darren told William of retaining <i>Woo</i>, and of <i>everything</i> Woo told him.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Faux disbelief:)</i> I can't--I can't <i>believe</i> this! The police didn't tell me Woo told <i>them</i> that he found out what was going on! <i>(Faux gasp:)</i> Why, I was under the <i>impression</i> that <i>they</i> told me! This is <i>incredible</i>! <i>(Pauses:)</i> What about <i>Woo</i>? He <i>failed</i> you--did you <i>fire</i> him for <i>allowing</i> this <i>bastard</i> Sanchez to die?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Hesitates, decides not to say anything about Woo's drinking:)</i> Uncle Will, er--can we discuss something <i>else</i>? I--don't want to <i>talk</i> about Woo anymore tonight, you know--?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: Of course, nephew, of course--and who could <i>blame</i> you? <i>(Pauses, becomes angry:)</i> Well, I know he'll <i>never</i> work for us again--and when I'm <i>finished</i>, never for anyone <i>else</i>, either!</p> 

<p>DARREN: I--<i>guess</i>, Uncle. <i>(Realizes:)</i> W-what about <i>aunt Millie</i>? She doesn't know about--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Cuts him off gently:)</i> --Calm down, Darren--<i>I'll</i> tell her the--<i>horribly tragic</i> news. <i>(Pauses:)</i> What are <i>you</i> going to do now, my boy?</p>

<p>DARREN: I-I'm going to <i>tell</i> the Morgendorffers who I am <i>tomorrow</i>, Uncle Will--I can't <i>stand</i> to do this anymore--that and the fact that I can't put them in <i>danger</i>--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Slightly alarmed, but goes into "control" mode:)</i> --Uh, Darren, don't <i>misunderstand</i> me, but I'd like to ask you to <i>hold off</i> telling them until at least <i>Monday</i> morning.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Frowns:) What</i>, Uncle Will? <i>Why</i>? I might as well--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: --Darren, please <i>listen</i> to me. I'd like to inform your aunt, the Board, and the stockholders <i>first</i> before you tell the Morgendorffers--I asked the police to <i>wait</i> until then, and they agreed as well. We have to <i>prepare</i> them all for the incredible <i>onslaught</i> of <i>attention</i> this is going to bring, not to mention how this is going to affect our company's standing on the <i>world markets</i>. I'm not trying to sound <i>cold</i> here, Darren, but we all have to stand <i>together</i> on this--this--<i>unbelievable</i> situation. All I ask is for <i>two</i> more days, and everything will--<i>come</i> in place. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Will you <i>please</i> let me have that time, my boy?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(After a long moment:)</i> I--I <i>guess</i> so, Uncle--but I'm worried about my birth family and girlfriend. What if--what if whoever killed Sanchez tries to come after <i>me</i>, and goes after <i>them</i> to get to me, instead?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Faux surprised tone:)</i> Oh, you have a <i>girlfriend</i>, too, eh? Excellent, Darren--I'd like to <i>meet</i> her!</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gives a slightly exasperated sigh:)</i> Perhaps later, Uncle, but what about her and my birth family?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: Hmmm--yes, I see your <i>dilemma--(pauses:)</i> have you seen anyone or anything <i>suspicious</i> going on while you've been in this <i>"Lawndale"</i> place, Darren?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(With a <b>wretched</b> look on his face:)</i> N-no, none that I've noticed--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: --And <i>no</i> one outside of <i>me</i>, your aunt Millie, Curtis, Elenor, and Claude know where you are, correct?</p>

<p>DARREN: Y-yes, Uncle Will--what are you <i>getting</i> at?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: What makes you think that whoever killed Sanchez knows <i>where</i> you are, then?</p>

<p>DARREN: I-I'm not sure--<i>(narrows his eyes:)</i> but what if someone goes after one of <i>them</i>, and tries to <i>kidnap</i> them to find out where I am, Uncle Will? For that matter, what about aunt Millie, Curtis, <i>you</i>, and the others?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: In the case of your <i>aunt</i>, Darren--remember, she has a <i>security</i> detail with her while she's in Europe. As for Elenor, and Claude, they're <i>safe</i> at the mansion with the security there, and I <i>personally</i> can <i>vouch</i> for <i>each</i> and <i>every</i> of the people who work there around the clock, so our staff is <i>secured</i> in place--despite what <i>Woo</i> said about <i>trusting</i> them. Now, as for <i>Curtis</i>, I could <i>order</i> some people to <i>protect</i> him and his family with their <i>permission, (adds with doubt:)</i> though I'm <i>still</i> not convinced if anyone would <i>really</i> do something, especially after I've heard that the media's been after <i>him</i> trying to find out where you are. Someone would have to be a <i>fool</i> to pursue a person who's currently in the <i>spotlight</i>, and draw <i>attention</i> to themselves.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Ponders:)</i> You're <i>right</i>, Uncle--you know, in an <i>ironic</i> way, Curtis is actually <i>safer</i> being in the <i>"spotlight"</i> as you've said, so I guess I don't have to worry about <i>him</i>, either.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>Exactly</i>--and as for <i>myself</i>, I'm certainly <i>not</i> going to <i>move</i> without having some people <i>around</i> me. To be <i>honest</i> with you, Darren, I'd wager to say that <i>everyone</i> is safe, including <i>yourself</i>, and your birth family, and girlfriend. <i>(Adds:)</i> I mean even if they <i>did</i> know where you were, and came to this <i>"Lawndale"</i>, you'd be the <i>only</i> one they'd go after--they wouldn't see your birth family and girlfriend as <i>important</i>--no offense.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smirks:)</i> None taken, Uncle. Better <i>me</i> than them if they did. I--suppose you have a <i>point. (Sighs:) Okay</i>, Uncle--I'll--I'll wait until <i>Monday--(frowns:)</i> but <i>not</i> beyond that, I don't care <i>what</i> you say, <i>got</i> that?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(After a pause, in a very low, slightly <b>dark</b> tone:)</i> Oh, I've <i>"got"</i> that, Darren. <i>(Lightens tone:)</i> Don't fret, my boy--in fact, I think that things will <i>brighten up</i> soon, I <i>really</i> do.</p>

<p>DARREN: I wish I could <i>share</i> in your <i>optimism</i>, Uncle Will--<i>(looks at alarm clock, eyebrow cocked:) whoa</i>--it's almost <i>1:30 a.m. (Pauses:)</i> If there's nothing <i>else</i>, Uncle Will, I'm really <i>bushed--</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: --Nothing that I can <i>think</i> of, Darren--and, well--try to get some <i>sleep</i>, all right? I'll start <i>contacting</i> your aunt, the stockholders, and the Board first thing in the morning, and I'll call you--<i>(pauses:) Sunday</i> morning to see how you're doing.</p>

<p>DARREN: All right, Uncle Will--goodnight.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: Goodnight, nephew. <i>(Hangs up)</i></p>


     <p>Darren clicked off his phone, turned off his bedside lamp, then laid down on his bed, looking at the <i>ceiling</i>. He wondered briefly if anyone <i>else</i> in his birth family did such a thing while deep in thought for some reason, then <i>tenatively</i> closed his eyes, thinking about Monday when he would tell his birth family and Jane who he really was.</p>


     <p>William smirked <i>wickedly</i> as he turned off his phone, and laid back in his bed, smugly.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Thought v.o.: Enjoy your <b>last full day on earth</b> tomorrow, Darren, my dear "nephew".) (Closes his eyes)</i></p>



     <p>The morning sun had shown through the curtains of Darren's room. Darren opened his eyes wearily and looked at his alarm clock, and became <i>wide-eyed</i>. The time was <i>10:30 a.m.</i>--Darren almost <i>berated</i> himself for forgetting to turn the alarm clock on, then sighed--it was just as well--he did <i>not</i> sleep too well last night, and he figured he needed the extra time anyway. He had slept through <i>most</i> of the morning, and <i>missed</i> his daily jog--it would be too <i>warm</i> to start now. He remembered that Jane wouldn't be able to go with him, anyway, with this <i>"personal stuff"</i> she had to do with his sister, Daria. Darren briefly wondered <i>what</i> it was--a <i>birthday</i>? His wasn't for another <i>two</i> months (just before he went back to Eastward), and he didn't <i>recall</i> telling anyone, save his <i>grandmothers</i>, though he certainly didn't <i>need</i> anything. Maybe it was <i>Quinn's</i> birthday? It wasn't that far around the corner. He <i>chuckled</i> at that thought--<i>Jane</i> would <i>never</i> go that far to do something for Quinn as to get up in the <i>morning</i> to find a birthday gift for Quinn--<i>Daria</i> wouldn't either, for that matter. Perhaps it was for <i>Helen</i> or <i>Jake</i>--? Whatever the case, he decided to put on the <i>backburner</i> for the moment, getting out of bed, and stretching, then getting some clothes out of his bag, and preparing for the upcoming day.</p>

     <p>Darren was going to the bathroom to change out his housecoat and pajamas, when he ran into <i>Helen</i>, who was coming upstairs, fully dressed in her casual clothing.</p>


<p>HELEN: <i>(Grins:)</i> Good morning, son--how was your sleep? I thought about <i>waking</i> you, but you came in so <i>late</i> last night, I decided to let you sleep in.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles quietly:)</i> I--appreciate that, and it was--<i>fitful</i>, Helen. <i>(Looks around:)</i> Is everyone <i>up</i>, yet?</p>

<p>HELEN: You just missed Daria by about <i>30</i> minutes, Darren--she wanted to get out and get to Jane's for some reason--said she wanted to get some <i>"personal stuff"</i> done. Jake's out with a <i>client</i>, and took him for a <i>golf</i> match--he wanted to take <i>you</i>, but after I--<i>(frowns slightly:) "spoke"</i> to him, he thought the <i>better</i> of it, and left. <i>(Darren cocks an eyebrow at the way Helen said "spoke")</i> Ooooh, and <i>Quinn</i> came in <i>early</i> this morning--she <i>told</i> me so when I came into her room to put away some of her clean clothes, and <i>found</i> her in her bed. <i>(Darren shows a very tiny smirk)</i> She said she couldn't sleep too well at Stacy's, so she left there, and came back to catch a few hours <i>more</i> of sleep. <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Oh well--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Thought v.o.: Quinn thinks <b>quick</b> on her feet, er--I mean, on her <b>back</b> when she wants to, I'll give her that.)</i> Ah, yes--well, I hope Quinn had a--<i>good</i> time with her friends last night.</p>

<p>HELEN: I'm <i>sure</i> she did, son. <i>(Realizes:) Oh</i>, I almost <i>forgot</i>! <i>(Begins to grin:)</i> Last night, your father and I had an <i>incredible</i> financial opportunity <i>drop</i> into our laps. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Jake and I've already told <i>Daria</i> about it, and I'll tell Quinn after she gets up. Darren, I'd like to tell you during breakfast, if that's okay--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles, shrugs:)</i> --Sure, I'd like that--let me take a shower, change, and we can then talk. <i>(Prepares to go into bathroom)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: Oh, Darren--I meant to ask--did everything work out with this <i>"Sanchez"</i> fellow? You seemed so <i>excited</i> about him for some reason--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Downcast look, sighs, in a low tone:)</i> Sorry, Helen--it--didn't work out, I'm afraid--excuse me. <i>(Goes into bathroom, while Helen watches after him sadly)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the Lawndale library, the same time)</i></p>



     <p>Daria and a <i>very</i> tired-looking Jane sat at a table in the reference section, surrounded by a large amount of microfilm and old newspaper articles. Daria was intently looking over the articles, while Jane was <i>barely</i> holding up her head, nodding. Daria arched an eyebrow at Jane's situation, then spoke in a low voice.</p>


<p>DARIA: Jane? <i>(Smirks:)</i> Wake up--I know you're having a <i>difficult</i> time in being here, but I need you to help me in finding out whether or not my bro and your boyfriend is who he <i>says</i> he is. Don't <i>die</i> on me now--<i>(pauses, adds:)</i> at least not until we <i>find</i> something.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Yawns:)</i> Sorry--of course, you didn't give me <i>enough</i> time to get my <i>customary</i> cup of coffee this morning, so it's <i>partially</i> your fault, amiga.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> So <i>noted</i>, but I wanted to start as early as possible, and get this out of the way--besides, I could've woken you even <i>earlier</i>, so you shouldn't <i>complain. (Points near the front:)</i> You obviously haven't been here for a <i>while</i>, or you'd know about the <i>coffee shop</i> that was put in at the same time that they'd installed the <i>new</i> roof several months ago--the local politicians said they wanted to add a little <i>"spice"</i> to our library--too bad they <i>forgot</i> to add more <i>books</i>.</p>


<p><i>(Note to reader: The library where I live has a coffee shop in it--I'm doing the same thing with the library in Lawndale, too.)</i></p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Sits up, looks wearily where Daria pointed:)</i> Really? I <i>missed</i> that? Damn! <i>(Gets up:)</i> I'll be right back. <i>(Leaves)</i></p>


     <p>Daria looked at all the information she had concerning the Appleton family, which stretched back almost <i>150 years</i> in wealth, from a profitable <i>shipping</i> trade. There was the story of how Arthur Appleton Sr., an aspiring techno-geek, had <i>inherited</i> most of the wealth from his father, industrialist <i>Richard Appleton</i> (the rest to his brother and sister), and proceeded to create a <i>computer</i> business, that, while not having the same <i>growth</i> as say, <i>Microsoft</i>, nevertheless, grew quite <i>large</i>, and began to diversify along the way into other business interests, such as energy, fashion (headed by Arthur Sr.'s wife Lucille), food, and the media. Along the way, Arthur's younger brother, <i>William Appleton</i>, had helped Arthur Sr. <i>orchestrate</i> many of the acquisitions throughout the years. Though there had been several takeover attempts of Appleton <i>itself</i> over the years, Appleton had just been <i>large</i> enough to <i>thwart</i> any such threats.</p>

     <p>Daria examined the <i>pictures</i> of the Appletons, but there were <i>none</i> of their son, <i>Arthur Jr.</i>, save for some <i>baby</i> ones. Jane can back with a large cup of cappuccino coffee, sitting down at the table, looking a little more alert. Daria glanced at Jane, privately <i>amazed</i> that her friend could <i>"perk up"</i> so fast after a cup of coffee.</p> 


<p>JANE: So, what did you find, amiga--anything to go on, yet? <i>(Sips her cappuccino)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks down, shuffles articles:)</i> Nope, just some baby pics of the Appleton's son--I certainly can't tell from those if he's my bro. I've heard that his parents were <i>very</i> protective of their son, but this is <i>incredible</i>. You'd think in this <i>modern</i> media age, that <i>someone</i> would've taken his picture recently. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I can't even find any <i>clear</i> ones of Arthur Jr. at his parent's <i>funeral</i>--just some <i>fuzzy</i> ones, or pics that have someone in the <i>way</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> Hm--that <i>is</i> mind-boggling. <i>(Smirks:)</i> My boyfriend might be a master <i>magician</i>, or something.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Not looking up:)</i> Or <i>something. Princess Diana</i> might've <i>lived</i> if she took some <i>lessons</i> from the Appletons concerning privacy. <i>(Pauses:) Hello</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:) Howdy. (Daria turns her mouth down momentarily at Jane's attempt at humor, while Jane leans over to her, looks at the article:)</i> Got something?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>Oh yeah</i>. One article here from his parent's funeral lists Arthur Jr.'s <i>middle</i> name as <i>"Darren"</i>--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Ponders, shrugs:) --So</i>? Darren's a <i>fairly</i> common name.</p>

<p>DARIA: Wait, I'm <i>not</i> finished--his parent's <i>middle</i> names were <i>Walter</i> and <i>Grace--(Jane's eyebrows raise up)</i>, the <i>same</i> names he told us that his adopted parents were called. It also says that his dad was head of the <i>technology</i> division--Darren told us the first night he was there, that his dad worked on <i>computers</i>, and created programs for them, what the article here <i>says</i>. His mom was head of the <i>fashion</i> division, and get this--she was also the head <i>fashion designer</i>, what Darren told Quinn <i>his</i> mom did. Also, it says Arthur Jr. is attending <i>Eastward College</i>, and here's the <i>kicker--(dramatic pause:)</i> the article says that, quote, <i>"Arthur Appleton Jr. was still trying to recover from the death of his girlfriend, Stephanie Reardon, from a sudden cerebral hemorrhage."</i> Now, unless there's <i>more</i> than one <i>"Stephanie Reardon"</i>, and that <i>she</i> had a cerebral hemorrhage, <i>too</i>, we've got <i>enough</i> info here to ask my bro and your boyfriend what's up with the <i>ruse</i>.</p>


     <p>There was an <i>inordinately</i> long pause between the two young women as they simply <i>stared</i> at each other.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Hesitates:) Ooookay</i>--so, do we <i>show</i> Darren the <i>"evidence"</i> we have now, or what?</p>


     <p>Daria's face slowly frowned in deep thought for a long minute. Jane watched her intently, occasionally sipping the cappuccino. Daria then pointedly looked at Jane, and spoke.</p>


<p>DARIA</i> <i>(Sighs, shakes her head slowly:) No</i>, Jane--I just--I just <i>can't</i> do it. <i>(Jane sighs, privately relieved)</i> He <i>was</i> telling the truth about what he's been through these past two months, <i>especially</i> his late fiancee's death, thank goodness, and going to Eastward--just not <i>completely</i>--as if he was <i>wanting</i> to tell us the truth, but has just stopped <i>short</i> of doing so for some reason. Whatever my bro's <i>up</i> to, I think I've--<i>we've</i> known him <i>long</i> enough to <i>trust</i> him. <i>(Pauses:)</i> You know, he might be pretending to be someone else to get away from the <i>intense media attention</i>, and could tell us who he really is just before he goes back to Eastward.</p> 

<p>JANE: <i>(Nods her head:)</i> Yeah, that's possible, Daria--of course, it's a little <i>ironic</i>--Darren gets a <i>hell</i> of a lot of attention from the <i>opposite</i> sex when he goes <i>out</i>--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> --Much to your <i>chagrin. (Jane snorts, rolls her eyes)</i> So, I guess we should <i>wait</i>, then.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>Agreed</i>, amiga. <i>(Adds:)</i> Um, I told you I didn't <i>care</i> about the <i>money</i> that he has, and I <i>don't</i>, really, but I'm just kinda <i>curious</i>--does that article say <i>how</i> much he's <i>worth</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: Nope--but it says the Appleton <i>conglomerate's</i> estimated worth is about <i>$70 billion (Jane's eyes almost pop out her head, and her mouth drops)</i>, so suffice it to say that my bro's probably <i>loaded</i>, and <i>then</i> some. <i>(Starts to gather what's lying on the table:)</i> Help me put this all back, will you, Jane? <i>(Looks up at Jane:)</i> Um, <i>Jane</i>?</p>


     <p>Jane was still in <i>stun</i> mode, having kept the <i>same</i> look on her face, and looking foreward in space, as if <i>mesmerized</i>. Daria waved her hand in front of Jane's face, and sighed.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Thought v.o.: I can see it now--<b>"My name is Darren Appleton, gazillionaire--I own a mansion and a yacht. Again. My name is Darren Appleton, gazillionaire--I own a mansion and a yacht. Again"</b> I can only <b>imagine</b> what <b>Quinn's</b> gonna do when she finds out--she'll probably <b>buy out</b> Cashman's and the whole damn mall, and <b>all</b> of Lawndale, just for good measure)</i></p>


<p><i>(Note to reader: Daria's little quip here comes from the 1955 Warner Brothers Bugs Bunny/Elmer J. Fudd cartoon <b>"Hare Brush"</b>, in which Bugs thinks he's Elmer and vice-versa, thanks to a psychologist and hypnosis!)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to Gerald Woo's apartment, the same time)</i></p>



     <p>The constant <i>pounding</i> of the door continued until a worn-looking Gerald Woo finally woke out of his slumber on the sofa. Of course, it did not help that the noise <i>coincided</i> with the constant pounding of the throbbing pain in his <i>head</i>. He wearily got up off the sofa, holding his head, and staggered to the door, pausing only just enough to look through the peephole to see David and Leroy in the hallway. He unlocked and opened his door.</p> 


<p>WOO: <i>(In a tired tone:)</i> Gentlemen, good morning.</p>

<p>LEROY: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> Well, <i>good morning</i>, Woo--it's about <i>time</i> you let us in! For a second there, we thought you <i>weren't</i> here! Didn't you remember you wanted us to meet you down at the <i>office</i> this morning? David and I were <i>tempted</i> to call <i>Carla</i> and get her to let us in your apartment!</p>

<p>DAVID: We tried <i>paging</i> you, and calling, but the operator said your phone was <i>out of order. (Smirks:)</i> You <i>forgot</i> to pay the <i>bill</i>, Woo?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Glares:) Not</i> funny, David. <i>(Turns around, while the others come into the apartment behind him, picks up the cell phone off the floor, and clicks it off:) This</i> was why the operator thought my phone was out of order. <i>(Plops down on the couch, rubs his throbbing head)</i></p>


     <p>David and Leroy suddenly looked around, then at each other, and stared at Woo for a moment. Woo frowned up at them for an instant, perplexed.</p>


<p>WOO: Is something <i>wrong</i>, you two?</p>

<p>DAVID: Well, uh--<i>(motions head at the empty wine bottle on the floor:) that</i>.</p>


     <p>Woo followed David's look, then sighed.</p>


<p>WOO: <i>Yes</i>, I was--<i>drinking</i> last night. I was--<i>depressed</i>.</p> 

<p>LEROY: Aw, Woo--man, we told you yesterday--</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Gets up, cuts Leroy off, frowns:)</i> --You told me yesterday that I did <i>nothing</i> wrong, and I couldn't have known about the bugging, but I also remembered that I said there was <i>no</i> excuse for me not suspecting something, and there <i>wasn't</i>! <i>(Grabs sides of his head, winces:) Uhhhgh</i>!</p>

<p>DAVID: <i>(Rolls his eyes:) Okay</i>--so you've just found out that you're not <i>perfect</i> like every other P.I. in this city, Woo--<i>(Woo narrows his eyes at David)</i> but <i>get over it</i>! Darren Appleton still <i>needs</i> you! <i>(Woo looks away for a moment, ponders)</i> You can't just sit here feeling <i>sorry</i> for yourself, while whoever killed Sanchez is still <i>out</i> there, and may now go after Darren Appleton!</p>

<p>LEROY: David's <i>right</i>, Woo--you've gotta shake this <i>off</i>.</p>


     <p>Woo sat back on his sofa, and sighed, deep in thought. He then clenched his teeth, and got a <i>determined</i> look on his face, looking up at David and Leroy.</p>


<p>WOO: You're--you're <i>right</i>, the both of you. What in the <i>hell</i> was I thinking? I can't let Darren Appleton down now, and--</p>


     <p>Woo's eyes suddenly went wide in realization, and he turned <i>pale</i>.</p>


<p>DAVID: Er--what's <i>wrong</i>, Woo?</p>

<p>WOO: --<i>oh no</i>--I just remembered something--I was <i>drunk</i> when I talked to <i>Darren</i> last night! He called to ask about <i>Sanchez</i>! <i>Damn</i>! What he must <i>think</i> of me right now! <i>(Reaches for cell phone, clicks it on, punches buttons)</i></p>


     <p>At the Morgendorffer's, a-trying-to-look-interested Darren was downstairs listening to an very <i>animated</i> Helen (no pun intended) talking about her and Jake's <i>"good fortune"</i> over a late breakfast of <i>waffles</i> and bacon (fixed by Darren) in the kitchen. He did <i>not</i> hear his cell phone ringing upstairs in his room (partly because of Helen's excited voice describing what the "good fortune" was). The cell phone ran about <i>ten</i> times before it stopped.</p>

     <p>Woo clicked off his cell phone, and sighed, looking down in a <i>defeated</i> daze.</p> 


<p>WOO: Well, I can't reach him--either he's not there at the moment, or--<i>(in a very low, resigned tone of voice:)</i> he's <i>choosing</i> not to talk to me because of what happened last night.</p>

<p>DAVID: <i>(Tries to sound reassuring:) C'mon</i>, Woo--Darren's probably just not there right now--it <i>is</i> Saturday, you know. From what you told us, he's a pretty <i>understanding</i> client. I find it <i>hard</i> to believe that he'd not want to talk to you today.</p>

<p>LEROY: <i>(Ditto:)</i> Gotta go with David here, Woo--you can call him <i>later</i>.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(After a moment:)</i> I--suppose. <i>(Thinks, then begins to punch some more numbers on his cell phone)</i></p>

<p>DAVID: Who are you calling now, Woo?</p>

<p>WOO: Just checking out my <i>"small hunch"</i> I told you two about yesterday. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Hello? Is this <i>Appleton Industries</i>? My name is <i>Payne Wouger</i>, and I'd like to arrange an <i>appointment</i> with a <i>Mr. William Appleton</i> about a--<i>lucrative business merger</i>. Do you know if he'll be <i>in</i> today? I know that he comes in almost <i>all</i> the time on Saturdays, and--<i>(pauses:)</i> ah, I see--and you said he won't be in until <i>Monday</i>? <i>(Pauses:)</i> Something <i>suddenly</i> came up, eh? Do you know <i>where--(pauses:)</i> you <i>don't</i> know? <i>(Smirks:)</i> That's <i>never</i> happened since you can <i>remember</i>, eh? Oh well--maybe I'll just meet him <i>later</i>, then--thank you. <i>(Clicks off phone:)</i> Now, I find <i>this</i> interesting.</p>

<p>LEROY: Judging from the <i>bits</i> and <i>pieces</i> we picked up, William Appleton's not going to be at work today, and that he's <i>never</i> decided to do something like that at the <i>last</i> moment before.</p> 

<p>WOO: <i>(Narrows his eyes:) Exactly</i>--and this the day <i>after</i> Sanchez, the one <i>obstacle</i> that could have <i>fingered</i> who had hired him to sabotage the Appleton's plane, had been murdered.</p> 

<p>DAVID: Well, what does that <i>mean</i>, Woo? William Appleton might've just wanted a day <i>off</i> today--it could've been just a <i>coincidence</i>. You <i>still</i> think he had something to do with Sanchez's murder?</p>

<p>WOO: My gut instinct <i>screams</i> to me that William Appleton had something to do with this, David. After I told <i>Lt. Keller</i> what I found, I <i>assumed</i> he called <i>William Appleton</i>--Appleton being the <i>chairman</i> and all--and told him what had happened. It's possible Appleton had <i>left</i> town to plan what to do about Darren Appleton next, since Darren's the <i>lone</i> obstacle left, with Leonard Potter and Constance Waters now transferred <i>"safely"</i> out of the way, and Sanchez dead.</p> 

<p>LEROY: If you really think William Appleton's going to try something, Woo--it seems kind of <i>foolish</i> to do it so <i>soon</i> after Sanchez's death
--wouldn't the police suspect <i>something</i> if <i>Darren Appleton</i> suddenly turned up <i>dead</i>?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>How</i> would they <i>connect</i> it to William Appleton, Leroy? They didn't with <i>Sanchez</i>, did they?</p>

<p>DAVID: He's--got a <i>point</i>, Leroy--out of <i>habit</i>, I called my <i>source</i> that hangs around the station, and he <i>confirmed</i> to me last night that Lt. Keller <i>had</i> informed William Appleton that he <i>wasn't</i> a suspect because Darren Appleton <i>chose</i> him to head the conglomerate, just as we <i>suspected. (Woo nods his head slowly in agreement)</i> Not only that, but my source also overheard that William Appleton got Lt. Keller and his superiors to <i>agree</i> to wait until <i>Monday</i> before announcing what actually happened with Sanchez, so William Appleton could contact the Board and shareholders, and his sister and nephew <i>Darren</i>. (Woo arches a very high eyebrow at that) As far as the <i>media</i> is concerned, it's just a <i>random</i> murder, possibly <i>drug-related</i>. The <i>crap's</i> gonna hit the <i>fan</i> when the public finds out the <i>real</i> reason why Sanchez died.</p>

<p>WOO: Hmmm--William Appleton possibly contacted <i>Darren</i> about what the police said to William about Sanchez? <i>Why</i> would he do that?</p>

<p>LEROY: To throw <i>off</i> any possible suspicion, or, well--<i>(hesitates:)</i> maybe William Appleton might really <i>not</i> be involved? I mean, the man had just been told his brother and sister-in-law had been <i>murdered</i>--he could've needed some time to <i>recover</i>?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(After a moment:) No</i>, Leroy--<i>again</i>, for some reason, I'm <i>convinced</i> William Appleton <i>is</i> involved in this. I wished I could've gotten in touch with Darren, and found out if his uncle had called him yet.</p> 

<p>DAVID: Well, like Leroy said, maybe you can call him <i>later</i>, Woo.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Gets up:)</i> Perhaps, but I have a <i>better</i> idea at the moment, gentleman--I can talk <i>directly</i> to Darren <i>face-to-face</i>. We're <i>going</i> to Lawndale <i>today. (David and Leroy look at each other, surprised)</i> I'll be <i>damned</i> if we're out of place if someone tries to come after Darren Appleton--I won't <i>fail</i> him again. I suspect that you both believe we should call the <i>police</i> and tell them what we <i>think</i> could happen, but if William Appleton or someone else finds out that there's a <i>sudden</i> large police and F.B.I. presence in Lawndale, he wouldn't <i>dare</i> come within a <i>hundred</i> miles of the place.</p> 

<p>LEROY: Uh, Woo, there were <i>two</i> plainclothes cops that <i>followed</i> us here, just as we saw one plainclothes cop watching <i>your</i> apartment as we came up. <i>How</i> will we get <i>by</i> them?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Leave them to me. I'm calling <i>Carla</i>--the police will <i>not</i> be watching her like us--to them, she's a <i>"lowly"</i> secretary. I'm going to get her to swing by the <i>airport</i> and get some <i>tickets</i> for us on the flight to a city near Lawndale, then we can drive to there, and keep an <i>eye</i> out on Darren. As for getting by the police--<i>(grins:)</i> how would you fellows like to go to a <i>baseball</i> game? The <i>Dodgers</i> are playing today.</p>

<p>DAVID: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Ah, <i>that</i> old trick, Woo?</p>

<p>LEROY: <i>(Ditto:)</i> I have to admit, it works <i>every</i> time.</p>

<p>WOO: Then it's settled--<i>"Operation Copdumpers"</i> is set in motion--I'll call Carla, and then you guys can swing by your places and get some clothes, and <i>leave</i> it in your apartments for <i>Carla</i> to pick up <i>after</i> she gets the tickets--</p>

<p>DAVID: --While <i>we</i> go the ball game and <i>lose</i> the cops who are following us in the <i>crowd</i>--</p>

<p>LEROY: --And we can <i>double back</i> to the airport and go to Lawndale.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Punches the cell phone's numbers:)</i> Excellent--we'll meet at <i>Dodger Stadium</i> in an hour. Take off. <i>(Leroy and David leave)</i> Hello, Carla? <i>(Pauses, grins:)</i> Yes, I <i>know</i> this is your day <i>off</i>, but this is an <i>absolute</i> emergency--</p>



<p><i>(Scene changes back to the Morgendorffer's, 10 minutes later)</i></p>



     <p>Darren was considering all of what Helen had told him about her and Jake's <i>"good fortune"</i> while watching TV in the living room. Helen had left for awhile to to do a few hours of extra weekend work at the firm. (Helen also had given Quinn the details when Quinn had gotten up--Quinn began to <i>whine</i> about wanting to stay at home, but <i>perked up</i> when Helen said they'd go out to <i>Chez Pierre</i> after seeing the <i>"product"</i> Mr. Smith planned to show them.) It certainly was an <i>incredible</i> offer--<i>$25,000</i> even if they turned it down. Darren remembered some of the deals <i>his</i> parents had worked out over the years--of course they were a <i>bit</i> more--<i>hundred</i> million to <i>billion</i> dollar ones. He smiled quietly to himself, happy over Helen and Jake's news, and of the memories of <i>his</i> parent's <i>remarkable</i> business acumen.</p>

     <p>Still, there were a few things that <i>nagged</i> a bit at him--this <i>"Smith"</i> character was quite <i>secretive</i>--granted he wanted to protect his <i>"product"</i> from being <i>spied</i> upon by a possible competitor, something Darren understood <i>perfectly</i> well in business, but did he have to want to meet Darren's birth family in such a <i>"desolate"</i> place (at least that's what <i>Helen</i> had told him when he had inquired as to where) at some nearly-abandoned warehouses near Lawndale's waterfront? Darren hoped it would <i>not</i> be in one of the buildings, but <i>outside</i> of it--there was a possibility of an <i>accident</i> if the <i>floorboards</i> gave out, or something--were they <i>condemned</i>?</p> 

	<p>What about the <i>"Smith"</i> name? <i>Common</i> enough--perhaps a bit <i>too</i> common? He shook his head quickly at that thought. <i>You're becoming paranoid, Darren--uncle Will's right--who knows you're here other than your friends and family? You haven't seen anything <b>strange</b> happen around the town, save for some of the <b>people</b> that live here. You only have to wait until Monday for all of this to be out, so <b>relax</b>.</i></p> 

	<p>Suddenly, a <i>Sick, Sad World</i> episode appeared on the TV, and Darren started to <i>grin</i> in anticipation for the <i>funny</i> story--he wondered where Daria and Jane were, for they were missing this. He did not notice that both girls were coming into the living room.</p>


<p>TV ANNOUNCER: <i>(While theme music is playing, showing some birds sitting around a table in a dark room:)</i> Do birds <i>really</i> get together to <i>scheme</i> when to put their <i>droppings</i> on just-washed cars? The <i>"Bird Conspiracy"</i>, next, on <i>Sick, Sad World</i>!</p>


     <p>Darren was <i>laughing</i> at the TV when he caught a glimpse of Daria and Jane, and got up to greet them. Daria gave a quick glance at Jane, which basically said, <i>"Remember, say nothing"</i>. Jane gave her a knowing glance back.</p>


<p>DARIA: Hey, bro--uh, Jane and I caught the last part of that--the <i>"Bird Conspiracy"</i> ep--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Goes over to hug Darren:)</i> --Yeah, that was the one where certain birds are supposed to be rumored to <i>extort</i> bird seed from <i>city municipalities</i> in return for not <i>messing up</i> their citizen's cars. It's a classic. (Sits down beside him on the middle couch, while Daria sits on the right couch)</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Grins, chuckles:)</i> You've <i>got</i> to be <i>kidding</i> me.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:) Alfred Hitchcock</i> could've made a <i>sequel</i> to <i>"The Birds"</i> with <i>this</i> ep, bro. <i>(Notices Darren still smiling:)</i> Say, is it <i>me</i>, or do you seem to be really <i>happy</i> for some reason?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks over at Jane quietly, then Daria:)</i> Well, besides having <i>you</i> two here with me--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:)</i> --The boy <i>obviously</i> has <i>good</i> taste, here--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Ditto:)</i> --That he does, indeed--you may <i>continue</i>, bro--</p>

<p>DARREN: --I have a--<i>major</i> announcement that I want to make on Monday, <i>(Daria and Jane look at each other)</i> it's a--<i>surprise. (Pauses:)</i> I've been kind of feeling--<i>under the gun</i> for awhile, as you may have <i>noticed</i>, and I feel <i>relieved</i> that I can say something then--it'll help <i>explain</i> why I've been the way I've been.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>Really</i>? I <i>haven't</i> noticed. <i>(Takes another quick glance at Daria, who secretly rolls her eyes:)</i> So, um, you can't even <i>share</i> a <i>tiny</i> little bit of the <i>"surprise"</i> to us? <i>(Daria narrows her eyes a bit at Jane, who gives a quick shrug)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Well, I'd prefer to wait until Monday, Jane, but let's just say that when I tell you, it'll be a <i>load</i> off of my back--and hopefully, more importantly--<i>yours</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Glances at the stairs, smirks:)</i> Speaking of <i>"loads"</i>, here comes <i>one</i> right now--</p>


     <p><i>Quinn</i> came down the stairs on her cell phone, smirking.</p>


<p>QUINN: Don't <i>cry</i>, Scott--it'll just be just for <i>two</i> weeks, an' then I'll be <i>free</i> to start dating again! <i>(Pauses:)</i> Yeah, I can put you down on my <i>list</i>, no problem! Of course, you haveta realize that I'll <i>still</i> have <i>another</i> week after that before I can be off of my dumb <i>curfew</i>, so you might wanna wait until then to date me, unless you wanna bring me home by <i>8:00 p.m.</i>! <i>(Pauses, gasps:)</i> You <i>WILL</i> wait?! All right--see you then--byeee! <i>(Clicks off phone, comes into living room, delighted:)</i> Boy, that's the <i>tenth</i> guy who's called me in the past <i>hour</i>!</p>  

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Lining up your <i>suitors</i>, sis? Can't wait for that <i>dam</i> to burst open and <i>flood</i> the town--prepare for <i>evacuation</i>, everyone. <i>(Darren chuckles, and Jane smirks)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Frowns, confused:)</i> Huh? Daria, Lawndale is near an <i>ocean</i>! They wouldn't have <i>dams</i> for the water, they'd have--uh--<i>(looks up, then:)</i> what do they call those walls that hold <i>back</i> and <i>control</i> th' water--?</p>

<p>DARREN: --I believe they're called <i>dikes</i>, Quinn--though some <i>seawalls</i> can hold back and protect the land from <i>erosion--(pauses, frowns to himself:)</i> uh, aren't we getting off <i>track</i>, here?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks some more:)</i> I only think that <i>Quinn</i> is the one who's getting <i>"off track"</i>, Darren--as <i>usual. (Quinn rolls her eyes at Daria)</i></p>

<p>JANE: Speaking of the <i>ocean</i>, that reminds me--are you guys going to that <i>"invention thingamabob session"</i> near the waterfront that Daria told me about while we were out <i>instead</i> of <i>McGrundy's</i>? Daria wanted to check with <i>you</i>, Darren, before she told me.</p> 

<p>DARREN: No, though it would be somewhat <i>tempting</i> to see what this <i>"invention"</i> is--and Helen <i>understood</i> that--she said she and Jake would be taking <i>Quinn</i> out tonight to <i>Chez Pierre</i> following that meeting--we can go out to <i>McGrundy's</i>, Daria, Jane.</p> 

<p>QUINN: <i>(Giddy:)</i> An' I <i>can't</i> wait to go to <i>Chez Pierre</i> to eat! Even though I'm gonna be stuck with mom, dad, and some <i>dumb</i> guy, I'll be at my <i>favorite</i> eatin' place, so it won't be <i>that</i> bad--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> --And you can even lure <i>more</i> male <i>"patsies"</i> to round out your little <i>harem</i> of <i>guys</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Hey--it's like a bear <i>collectin'</i> food for th' winter, an' puttin' it up for <i>storage</i> in his <i>cave</i>, or somethin'--you gotta always have like, a ready <i>stock</i> available for when times get <i>hard--(Darren gives Quinn a <b>stunned</b> look at her "logic", while Jane snickers, and Daria slowly shakes her head, smirks)</i> though that'll <i>never</i> happen to <i>me</i>!</p>

<p>DARREN: Uh, Quinn--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Gently cuts him off, pats Darren's arm:) --Now, now</i>, Darren--let's leave Quinn to her little <i>"philosophies"--</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Watching the TV:)</i> --And quite a <i>fasinating</i> group of little <i>"philosophies"</i> they are, too--one of these days, I'm gonna write a <i>book</i> titled, <i>"Quinn's Words of Wisdom"</i>, available at a bookstore near <i>you</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Gasps, delighted, once again misunderstands Daria:) Really</i>, Daria? Well, when you're <i>ready</i>, let me know, an' I'll tell you all about <i>how</i> girls should get guys, while lettin' the guys think <i>they're</i> gettin' the girls, such as what clothes an' make-up to wear an' all--<i>(looks at a still shell-shocked Darren:) ooops</i>--that's right! Even though you're my bro, Darren, I can't say how in <i>front</i> of you--<i>female trade secret</i> an' all!</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks, faux admonishment:)</i> That's <i>right</i>, Darren--it would be a <i>crime</i> for you to hear Quinn's female trade secrets--even though they'd <i>eventually</i> get published in a book for <i>everyone</i> to read, anyway! <i>(Darren drops his head down, starts to laugh)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Smug:) Exactly</i>, Jane! <i>(Pauses:)</i> You know--don't take this th' <i>wrong</i> way and all, but I guess I'd prefer to see <i>you</i> with Darren than <i>Sandi</i>! I mean, I suppose like, I could <i>tolerate</i> you far <i>better</i> than I ever could her! <i>(Jane, Darren, and even Daria, who has turned down the TV out of shock, look at her, stunned. Quinn notices their reaction)</i> Hey, w-why are you guys <i>lookin'</i> at me like <i>that</i> for?</p> 


     <p>Daria was about to say something when the cell phone rang again. Quinn clicked it on.</p>


<p>QUINN: That's for <i>meee</i>! Hello?</p>

<p>VOICE: <i>(In a cold tone:)</i> Like, hello, Quinn--am I like, <i>disturbing</i> you, or something?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Surprised:) S-Sandi</i>? <i>(Everyone looks at Quinn, intrigued)</i> What are you callin' <i>me</i> for? <i>(Pauses:)</i> Have you decided to have a <i>fashion meeting</i> or somethin'? <i>(Thought v.o., smirks to herself: Or maybe you're tryin' to rub in my face what "happened" last night with Darren, "Felicia"?)</i></p>

<p>SANDI: <i>No</i>--I'm calling you to let you know that I <i>know</i> about your little <i>dirty trick</i> you, Jane, and Darri--Dariann--<i>Daria</i> pulled last night, because I <i>saw</i> Darren talking to you all, an' I'm <i>not</i> happy about it, not <i>one</i> bit! <i>(Quinn turns pale, while Darren, Daria, and Jane get up and crowd around the phone to listen)</i> No <i>wonder</i> Darren wouldn't kiss me last night! You all must've been <i>spying</i> on him, and he couldn't go <i>through</i> with it, because he <i>knew</i> you were there! <i>(Darren rolls his eyes, and Jane grins, amused, while Daria slightly smirks)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Nervous:) N-now</i>, Sandi, uh--</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Cuts her off, angry tone:)</i> --I like, demand <i>retrospect</i>! I want something to <i>make up</i> for my <i>embarassment</i> and <i>humiliation</i> last night!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks some more, in a low voice to Jane and Darren:)</i> Sandi wants to <i>remember</i> the <i>past</i>? Possibly go <i>back</i> into it? Maybe that inventor guy that mom and dad will be seeing this evening has created a <i>time machine</i>. Sandi could go <i>along</i> with Quinn and find out for herself. <i>(Quinn glares at Daria, while Jane and Darren snicker)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(In the same tone:)</i> I think Sandi means <i>retribution</i>, sis.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Wicked smirk:)</i> I know, bro--I couldn't <i>help</i> myself--it was too <i>easy</i> of a target for my <i>wonderful</i> sarcasm. <i>(Jane gives the same smirk)</i></p>

<p>SANDI: <i>AHA</i>! That's <i>Dari's</i> voice, isn't it? I <i>knew</i> it! <i>(Pauses:)</i> Now when I think about it, Dari has a <i>good</i> idea about goin' out this <i>evening</i>! You can pay me <i>back</i> in that manner, Quinn! I don't know <i>how</i> or <i>where</i>, yet, but--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Stunned look:)</i> --H-huh? <i>P-pay</i>? What are you talkin' about, Sandi? I'm not gonna <i>be</i> here tonight, because I'm goin' with my mom an' dad to see some guy, an' then we're going to go to <i>Chez Pierre</i>, an'--</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Sneering sound:)</i> --Even <i>better</i>! You <i>owe</i> me, an' if you don't lemme go with you to <i>Chez Pierre</i> tonight--you <i>paying</i>, of course--you'll be kicked <i>out</i> of th' Fashion Club!</p>


     <p>Frowning, Darren suddenly reached over and <i>snatched</i> the phone from an astonished Quinn.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Snarls:)</i> Now, <i>look</i>, Sandi--if you're going to <i>blame</i> someone, blame <i>me</i>. It was <i>my</i> idea for Daria and Jane to <i>spy</i> on us--leave Quinn <i>out</i> of it!</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Her voice turns a little softer, surprised:) D-Darren</i>? Uh--um--<i>(Daria, Quinn, and Jane look at each other, surprised at Sandi's sudden change of tone, while Darren doesn't notice)</i> er, don't you think I deserve <i>something</i> for what happened last night? <i>I</i> didn't know that they were spying on us, even though it was <i>your</i> idea--<i>(pauses:)</i> an' I do <i>forgive</i> you for it, by the way, because I know you were under <i>pressure</i> an' all--<i>(Quinn and Jane roll their eyes, while Daria looks impassive)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Through clenched teeth:)</i> --I <i>wasn't</i> "under pressure", Sandi, and--<i>(pauses, sighs:)</i> look, if <i>I</i> give Quinn some <i>money</i> for tonight to help pay for you to go to <i>Chez Pierre</i> with her, will that help <i>patch</i> things up, and keep Quinn in the Fashion Club? <i>(Daria and Jane give knowing looks to each other)</i></p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(After a moment:)</i> Like, sure, Darren--that'll do. <i>(Pauses, grows <b>very</b> quiet:)</i> Like, um, I'm really <i>sorry</i> for gettin' angry like that an' stuff. I wouldn't want <i>you</i> mad at me, or something, or another, Darren. <i>(Jane's mouth goes agape, then she grits her teeth, while Quinn looks dumbfounded, and Daria retains her "expressionless expression")</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Calms down:)</i> Well, I suppose no harm's been done, Sandi--I'll put Quinn back on the phone, and she'll give you the time when she, Jake, and Helen will pick you up tonight, okay?</p> 

<p>SANDI: <i>(In the same soft tone:)</i> Um, okay, Darren, and uh, like, <i>thanks</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow, glances over uneasily at Jane:)</i> Ah, you're--<i>welcome</i>, Sandi--here's Quinn. <i>(Gives Quinn the cell phone back, goes over to the side with Jane and Daria)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Sounding annoyed, slight frown:)</i> Well now--<i>someone's</i> beginning to have a <i>melting</i> effect on <i>"The Ice Witch"</i>, aren't they?</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Before Darren can speak, smirks:)</i> My bro's done what a <i>facial sledgehammer</i> couldn't do--<i>tame</i> "The Griffin".</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sighs:)</i> Jane, I hope you don't <i>think</i>--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Softens, walks up and pecks Darren on the mouth:) --Nahhh</i>. I guess you seem to have that <i>effect</i> on just about <i>every</i> girl you meet, Darren--even on the <i>"Debutante"</i>, there--I can't <i>fault</i> you for that. Besides, while Quinn and Sandi exchange fashion <i>horror</i> stories at <i>"Chez Crapola"</i>, you, me and Daria will be at <i>McGrundy's</i> tonight having a good time.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Yes--at least I won't have to <i>put up</i> with Sandi anymore tonight. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Oh, I meant to ask--did you two take <i>care</i> of that <i>"personal stuff"</i> that Daria said she wanted to get done today?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks over at Jane:)</i> Uh, <i>yeah</i>, bro--it's taken care of--in fact, Jane and I will tell you about it <i>Monday</i> as well, probably after you make <i>your</i> "surprise" announcement.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Raised eyebrows:) Really</i>? <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Well, I hope it won't get <i>lost</i> in my announcement.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks, glances at Daria:)</i> Oh, I don't think it will, Darren
--I don't think it will. <i>(Darren cocks his head at Jane, gives an inquisitive look)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: O--kay--anyway, anyone in the mood for some <i>pizza</i>? We can call it in, if you want.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Glances over at Jane, smirks:)</i> Sure--we're <i>always</i> in the mood for that--and I'm assuming that <i>you're</i> treating, bro?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Of course.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Of <i>course</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(After finishing her talk to Sandi, clicks off the phone, gives it to Darren:)</i> As long as you order me a small cheeseless one, Darren, it's okay. <i>(Darren starts dialing on the cell phone to the Pizza King)</i></p>




<p><i>(Scene changes to a highway, the same time)</i></p>



    <p>A silver-colored tinted-glass minivan went down the highway at a modest rate of speed through the hot and humid air. Inside the TV supplied, air-conditioned interior, Benny Lodell was driving, with Sam Norwood sitting shotgun, and going through some legal briefs. In the middle rear seat, wearing modest summer apparel like the other men, sat a bespectacled William Appleton, who was talking phoneless on a specially-connected intercom system while looking through some files. In the very rear, there were several duffel bags, and an icebox.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: --And you say that the men who <i>dispatched</i> Sanchez arrived in Lawndale very early this morning, Oscar?</p>

<p>OSCAR: Yessir--<i>Bert</i> and <i>Ernie</i> are sleeping in a room beside my room here at the <i>Knight's Inn</i>. They had <i>no</i> problems getting on the plane in Los Angeles. They told me they <i>ditched</i> the car in the <i>Pacific Ocean</i>--it'll take the cops <i>weeks</i> to find it <i>(snickers:)</i>--if at <i>all</i>.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: Good, I--<i>(cocks an eyebrow, pauses:) excuse me</i>, I'm sorry, Oscar, but did you say their names were <i>"Bert"</i> and <i>"Ernie"</i>?</p>

<p>OSCAR: Uh, yessir, Boss--<i>(pauses:)</i> is there--a <i>problem</i>, sir?</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Glances through the interior rearview mirror:)</i> Yeah, Boss--what's the problem? <i>(Norwood looks up and back at William as well)</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Looks over his glasses:) Shut up</i>, and keep driving, Benny. <i>(Frowns:)</i> What in the hell <i>is</i> this, Oscar? I find myself half-wondering if <i>Big Bird</i> and the <i>Cookie Monster</i> will be <i>joining</i> us along with <i>Elmo</i> and <i>Mr. Snuffalufacus</i>, and we suddenly break out into some sort of damn <i>educational-type of song-and-dance about a "rubber-ducky"</i>! <i>(Benny and Norwood look at each other strangely, then slowly turn foreward, <b>wide-eyed</b>, saying nothing)</i></p>

<p>OSCAR: Huh, Boss? I don't understand.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Sighs:)</i> Never mind, Oscar--I find myself feeling a little <i>tense</i>, that's all--wake up, er, <i>"Bert"</i> and <i>"Ernie"</i>, and get to that old warehouse area, and <i>set</i> things up. Continue to also scope out the surroundings--we want <i>absolute</i> privacy when I <i>"deal"</i> with my <i>"nephew". (Adds:)</i> Make sure you also check out where the <i>"players"</i> are before we get there--got that? I don't want any <i>last-minute snafus--(pauses, grins:)</i> oh, yes, and have you gotten in contact with that <i>courier service</i> concerning delivering <i>"The Message"</i> to my <i>"nephew"</i>?</p>

<p>OSCAR: Yessir, though when I at first told them what <i>house</i> I wanted them to deliver <i>"The Message"</i> to, the courier service seemed a little <i>reluctant</i> for some reason--however, when I offered them an <i>advance</i> payment to deliver <i>"The Message"</i>, they <i>jumped</i> at the opportunity. How far are you all from Lawndale, Boss?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Looks up:)</i> Benny?</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Looks over at the dashboard clock:)</i> Estimated time of arrival is <i>two</i> hours, Boss.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: Did you hear that, Oscar?</p>

<p>OSCAR: Yessir--see you then. <i>(Hangs up)</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Scowls:)</i> Sam, is everything <i>set</i> for my <i>"nephew"</i> to sign over the company to me legally?</p>

<p>NORWOOD: <i>(In a nervous tone, swivels his chair to face William:)</i> Y-yessir. I-I have the legal documents all prepared for your <i>"nephew"</i> to sign, Boss.</p> 

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Sits back in his chair, smug:)</i> Good--very good. I want us to make sure this all goes down as <i>quickly</i> as possible--I have to be back in New York City by early Sunday <i>morning. (Grins sinisterly:)</i> We have to bid my <i>"nephew"</i> a <i>fond</i> farewell, after all, and everything has to be <i>"just right"</i> for his <i>demise. (Benny smirks wickedly, while Norwood wipes his forehead nervously with a hankercheif)</i> When we get to this <i>"Lawndale"</i>, we'll rest up, and then go over to that warehouse area to <i>"greet"</i> my dear <i>"nephew's"</i> birth family.</p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to a jumbo jet, the same time)</i></p>



     <p>The <i>Airdale Airlines</i> jet was now at 40,000 feet. Near the rear, Woo, was sitting in the aisle seat, while Leroy sat in the middle seat, and David sat in the window seat, looking out at the cumulus clouds that effortlessly stretched across the bright late-morning sky. A petite brunette stewardess came up to them, smiling, while rolling a cart of drinks and snacks.</p>


<p>STEWARDESS: Would you all like something to eat or drink, gentleman?</p>

<p>LEROY: Uh, yeah--gimme a Coke and peanuts--thanks.</p>

<p>DAVID: Iced tea and that snack cake, please.</p>

<p>WOO: Just black coffee, thank you.</p> 


     <p>The stewardess gave them what they asked, and continued on her way down the aisle to the other passengers.</p>


<p>LEROY: <i>(Sits back in his seat, sighs in relief:)</i> That was kind of <i>close</i>, there, Woo--I thought for <i>sure</i> we wouldn't be able to give those plainclothes cops the <i>slip</i> at the ballgame! I'll just bet Keller's gonna be <i>PO'd</i> when they come back and tell him they <i>lost</i> us! <i>(Sips his cup of soda)</i></p>

<p>DAVID: <i>(Rolls his eyes, chuckles, sarcastic tone:)</i> Oh, that's just <i>tough</i>--still, I found myself occasionally looking <i>back</i> over my shoulder when we left <i>Dodger Stadium</i>.</p> 

<p>WOO: A <i>good</i> thing that we were able to lose the police in the narrow <i>hallways</i> just inside the stadium because there were so many people in attendance--it was <i>"Bat Day"</i> after all, and a <i>sure</i> sell-out--</p>

<p>LEROY: <i>(Smirks:)</i> --And you had the <i>tickets</i>, Woo, don't <i>forget</i> that. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Carla didn't <i>waste</i> any time in having our plane tickets and bags, huh?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Yes, Leroy--Carla, as you <i>both</i> know, is <i>like</i> that--we can <i>always</i> count on her. <i>(Changes tone:)</i> All right, gentleman--the moment we arrive in Lawndale, we'll go to the <i>Morgendorffers</i>, and check on Darren. I already have a rental car ready to be waiting for us when we come to the local airport. The flight is scheduled to arrive near Lawndale about <i>7:00 p.m.</i> We'll talk to Darren, and then we'll get a hotel room for the next few nights.</p>

<p>DAVID: Woo, as you know, we're taking a <i>chance</i> on your <i>"hunch"</i>--William Appleton, or whoever, might <i>not</i> go after Darren Appleton--<i>(Woo nods slowly, then David hesitantly adds:)</i> are you--are you trying to <i>make up</i> for what you perceive as a--a <i>personal failure</i> to Darren? <i>(Leroy looks uneasily at David, then over at Woo)</i></p>


     <p>Woo stared stoically at David for a moment, then unbuckled his seat belt and got up. He turned to David, frowned, leaned over, and spoke in a <i>cold</i> whisper.</p>


<p>WOO: Of <i>course</i> it was a <i>personal</i> failure, David--I <i>told</i> you that. I said I wanted to talk to Darren face-to-face, as well, and offer my <i>apologies</i>. Don't you forget that I--<i>we</i> were <i>used</i>, too--<i>(narrows his eyes:)</i> and like I <i>also</i> told you, I <i>hate</i> being used--did you forget <i>that</i>, too? <i>(Stands straight up:)</i> I'm going to try and call Darren again on the plane's phone--he might as well know that we're coming. <i>(Leaves)</i></p>


     <p>Leroy watched him go, then turned back to David with a look of <i>admonishment</i> on his face.</p>


<p>LEROY: What's the <i>matter</i> with you, man? You know what this is <i>doing</i> to Woo!</p>

<p>DAVID: <i>(Glares:)</i> That's just my <i>point</i>, Leroy--he's taking this <i>too</i> personally--I mean <i>look</i> at us! We're going to a <i>hick</i> hi-income suburban town across the country because he's <i>PO'd</i> that someone <i>"used"</i> him to kill a piece of <i>trash</i> like Sanchez!</p> 

<p>LEROY: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow, feigns surprise:)</i> Well, <i>damn</i>--what'd you <i>expect</i>, David? He wants to get <i>back</i> at whoever did this--and <i>I</i> want to, too! Don't <i>you</i>?</p>

<p>DAVID: <i>(Looks up, exasperated:) Of course</i> I do, Leroy--it's just I've <i>never</i> seen him this worked <i>up</i> over a case before. I just hope this isn't some sort of wild <i>goose</i> chase and that something actually <i>happens</i> to get him out of his little <i>"funk"</i>.</p>

<p>LEROY: <i>(Finishes his snacks, puts trash in a container in the rear of the seat in front of him:) Relax</i>, we'll be <i>ready</i> if it isn't a wild goose chase--<i>(lowers his voice to a whisper, looks around quickly:)</i> thanks to that security woman <i>Maxine</i> letting us <i>pass</i> by with our <i>weapons</i> through the metal detectors.</p>

<p>DAVID: <i>(Ditto:) Huh</i>--Woo must've paid her a <i>pretty</i> penny to take a <i>chance</i> like that.</p>

<p>LEROY: <i>(Grins, closes his eyes, crosses his arms, leans back in his seat:)</i> It's <i>more</i> than just that, bud--Woo's kind of <i>attracted</i> to her--Carla <i>told</i> me the other day. <i>(David looks at Leroy, stunned)</i></p>


     <p>Woo stood in line impatiently in front of several other passengers, waiting for a <i>heavy-set</i> woman, who was wearing a <i>large straw hat</i> and a green summer pants suit, finish her conversation.</p>


<p>WOMAN: That's right, dear--I'll be arriving at the airport near <i>Middlebury</i> about 7:00 p.m. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I'll see you then--goodbye. <i>(Hangs up the phone, leaves)</i></p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Watches the woman leave, frowns in mild disgust along with the other passengers in line who were watching her as well, thought v.o.: That is one <b>ugly</b> straw hat--it looks like it could go on the head of a <b>horse</b> on a farm--oh, well--) (Picks up phone, dials)</i></p>


<p><i>(Note to reader: Yes, this is the "Aunt Bernice" of Jane and Trent from the episode "The Teachings of Don Jake"--I couldn't resist!)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene is back at the Morgendorffer's)</i></p>



     <p>Quinn was in her room eating a slice of the cheeseless pizza Darren had ordered for her, talking to a <i>pleading</i> Stacy on <i>Darren's</i> phone. Downstairs, Daria Jane, and Darren were watching <i>Sick, Sad World</i>.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(Smug look:)</i> Oh, I don't <i>know</i>, Stacy--you an' Tiffany really <i>hurt</i> me last night when you didn't come to my <i>rescue</i>--why <i>should</i> I <i>talk</i> to you?</p>

<p>STACY: <i>(Almost crying:) Pleeeease</i>, Quinn--I got sooo <i>scared</i> of Sandi, and I didn't want to be put in the <i>middle</i>! <i>Pleeease</i> don't hold it <i>against</i> me!</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Enjoying this while picking at her pizza slice:)</i> I <i>dunno</i>, Stacy--I mean, <i>Tiffany</i> just called me, an' wanted me to <i>forgive</i> her, too--<i>(pauses:)</i> tell ya what--you come over with my bag of clothes <i>tomorrow</i>, an' I'll <i>consider</i> forgivin' you, okay?</p>

<p>STACY: <i>(Now estatic:) Oh THANKYOUTHANKYOUTHANKYOUTHANKYOU</i>, Quinn! <i>(Quinn smirks slowly--Stacy's back to Quinn's side--just like Tiffany is)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene goes back to the plane)</i></p>



     <p>Woo listened to the busy signal, then hung up the phone slowly and quietly. Darren obviously was talking to someone else. Woo decided to not call anymore to Darren, simply just to <i>show up</i> at the Morgendorffers--when Woo thought about it, it was probably <i>better</i> that way--perhaps Darren would be <i>grateful</i> for the surprise visit--and be more </i>forgiving</i> of how and why Woo behaved the way he did last night--one could only <i>hope</i>. He sighed and went back to his seat, while another passenger picked up the phone.</p>



<p><i>(Scene fast-forwards to the Morgendorffer's, about 6:00 p.m.)</i></p>



     <p>Helen came downstairs to the living room, dressed in a slightly more upscale version of her power suit--a gold-colored one, while an <i>impatient</i> Jake waited, standing in the center of the living room, pacing, and looking at his watch. When Helen had at first heard from Quinn asking if she could take <i>Sandi</i> with them to <i>Chez Pierre</i> for a <i>"mini-fashion/food summit between the president and the vice-president"</i>, Helen had almost said <i>no</i>--then she remembered the possibly <i>lucrative</i> meeting she and Jake were going to have with this "John Smith" fellow, and put on a <i>deliciously wicked</i> smile. Helen figured that Sandi could inform a <i>jealous</i> Linda of Helen's "good fortune"--in and of itself an <i>ironic</i> situation, and Helen promptly changed her mind, <i>enthusiastically</i> giving her support for Sandi to come along.</p> 

     <p>In the meantime, Quinn was putting on her "finishing touches" on herself in her room. There was <i>no</i> way Sandi was going to look <i>prettier</i> than her at <i>Chez Pierre</i>. Quinn's "plan" of getting even <i>more</i> boys to date after the dating/curfew ban was somewhat <i>thwarted</i> by her greatest rival being there <i>with</i> her, but in a way, it could work to Quinn's <i>advantage</i>--both she and Sandi could <i>compete</i> over the number of boys that would go out with them when the boys <i>compared</i> the two there--and Quinn was <i>very</i> confident that she'd <i>easily</i> outdo Sandi.</p> 

     <p>Daria was in her room reading, waiting for when Darren would be ready to go, while Darren was in his room talking to Curtis, and telling his friend that Monday would <i>definitely</i> be the day to tell his birth family who he really was (he did not add that he also was going to tell them about <i>why</i> he could not say who he really was until then as well--the same for his friend until then), <i>"Come Hell or Highwater"</i>. Curtis was relieved when told so. Darren said goodbye to his friend, and clicked off the phone, going downstairs. Helen was waiting with an <i>increasingly</i> angry Jake in the living room.</p>


<p>JAKE: <i>(Looks at his watch, becomes wide-eyed:)</i> GAH! DAMMIT! <i>(Looks up, frowns:)</i> QUINN, GET THE <i>HELL</i> DOWN HERE SO WE CAN GO! WE GOTTA PICK UP YOUR LITTLE FRIEND, SANDI, TOO, YOU KNOW! <i>(Darren flinches at Jake's rant)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Frowns at Jake:)</i> Jake, calm down--we'll get there in time! <i>(Looks at watch, gasps, looks up, frowns:)</i> QUINN, GET DOWN HERE <i>NOW</i>, YOUNG LADY! <i>(Darren flinches at Helen's rant as well, Helen then calms down a bit when she sees Darren:)</i> Oh, Darren, when are you, Daria, and Jane going to that <i>McGrundy's</i> place?</p>

<p>DARREN: Uh, about <i>7:30</i>, Helen. I don't know what time we'll be coming back--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Never mind, sweetie, I <i>know</i> you'll take <i>good</i> care of your sister and Jane. <i>(Looks up again:)</i> QUINN, WE'RE NOT GETTING ANY YOUNGER!</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(From upstairs:)</i> MUH--OOM! You can't rush <i>perfection</i>!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Also from upstairs:)</i> But mom and dad <i>are</i> rushing <i>you</i>, sis.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Still from upstairs:)</i> Shut up, Daria!</p>


     <p>Quinn finally came in view down the stairs in the same <i>"dramatic"</i> style that she had when Darren took her to <i>Chez Pierre</i>. She wore a lavendar sleeveless <i>chiffon</i> dress, white strapless dress shoes, and a lavandar chiffon scarf with a matching white purse. Her make-up was modest, but it brought out her face quite well. Quinn's hair was done in a wrap-around fashion (similar to the episode "Pierce Me"). Daria also came down behind her. Both Jake and Darren did a <i>double-take</i> when they saw Quinn, who immediately caught their looks, and turned on the <i>charm</i>.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(Smiles triumphantly:)</i> Well, Daddy, Darren, what do you guys think? <i>(Thought v.o.: Sandi's <b>doomed</b>.)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Proud smile:)</i> My little girl's a young <i>woman</i>!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles:)</i> You look <i>stunning</i>, Quinn, I have to admit.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Ditto:)</i> Sweetie, I <i>must</i> say you look <i>beautiful</i>!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> I know <i>I</i> must <i>not</i> have to say it, so I'll just say <i>good</i> luck on trying to <i>outdo</i> Sandi, sis. <i>(Quinn and Helen frown at her)</i> Hey, I'm <i>cheering</i> for Quinn to <i>win</i> the <i>"Who-looks-better-than-who"</i> contest with Sandi, you know, so it really wasn't an <i>insult</i>--after all, <i>"blood is thicker than water"</i>--and all that blood that's gonna be <i>spilled</i> at <i>Chez Pierre</i> has to be <i>washed out</i> by the <i>water</i> that's gonna be spilled from the <i>sweat and tears</i> that are gonna be <i>falling</i> during the <i>fashion-fight. (Darren chuckles quietly to himself)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Narrows her eyes, becomes angry along with Helen:)</i> DARIA--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Waves her hands, cuts her off:)</i> --Off with you all, now--<i>shoo, shoo</i>--you don't wanna be late trying to hit it <i>big</i>, do you, Mom and Dad?</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Before Helen and Quinn can say anything:)</i> Hey, that's right! Let's go, you two! You and Darren have a good time at <i>McDonald's</i>, Kiddo! <i>(Pulls a surprised Helen and Quinn out with him, Helen shuts the door behind her)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Laughs, looks back at Daria:) McDonald's</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Yeah--haven't you heard, bro? We're gonna see <i>Ronald McDonald</i> sing <i>"Icebox Woman"</i> and give out <i>Happy Meals</i> simultaneously. It's the restaurant's <i>new</i> way of drawing in customers because their <i>crappy-tasting</i> food isn't doing the <i>trick</i> anymore--they need some new <i>gimmicks</i>.</p>


     <p>Darren, still laughing, was about to say something else when the doorbell rang. He opened it, and saw <i>Jane</i> standing there.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Hey, do I really look <i>that</i> funny? <i>(Goes up and kisses Darren)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Ditto:)</i> Define <i>"funny". (Jane mock-glares at Daria)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Grins:)</i> C'mon in, Jane. <i>(Jane does, and they all go into the living room)</i></p> 

<p>JANE: Got some <i>news</i> for you guys--Mystik Spiral's gonna be a little <i>late</i> coming in tonight--Trent called me just before I started to come over here, and told me that during their last practice, Max's new drum got a big <i>hole</i> in it--they're gonna be <i>delayed</i> an hour in getting to <i>McGrundy's</i> because the shop where they got it from was in <i>Leeville</i>. They're gonna get a <i>free</i> replacement there--part of the <i>"company guarantee"</i>. Trent's really <i>bummed</i> out about it.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>Ouch</i>--damn cheap drums. So it'll be <i>8:30</i>--okay. What'll we do in the <i>meantime</i> to occupy our <i>sinister</i> little minds for the next two hours?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:) Sick, Sad World's</i> having an <i>early</i> evening show. We could check it out.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Arches an eyebrow:) Hmm</i>--that show is on a <i>lot</i> here, isn't it?</p> 

<p>DARIA: I <i>never</i> noticed. Anyway, I'll make some microwavable popcorn, and we can watch another <i>"SSW Gem"</i> on the TV. <i>(Leaves for the kitchen)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Sits down on the couch, pats it, looks at Darren seductively:) C'mere</i>, you.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smirks, comes over:)</i> Be <i>gentle</i> with me. <i>(Sits down beside her)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Puts her arms around his neck, snorts:)</i> Yeah, <i>right</i>--since when have I done <i>that</i>? <i>(They both start to kiss each other deeply)</i></p>


     <p>Daria was about to come back in the living room when she saw Darren and Jane on the couch making out. She sighed quietly to herself, and slipped back into the kitchen.</p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to Jake's Lexus, the same time)</i></p>



     <p>Jake was driving like a <i>madman</i> on the way to the Griffins. Helen looked over at him, annoyed.</p>


<p>HELEN: Jake, slow down! This is a <i>residential</i> area! We'll get to see <i>"Mr. Smith"</i> in time--<i>(adds, low voice:)</i> unless you get a <i>damn</i> ticket, that is.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Jostled around a bit:)</i> Yeah, Daddy! My hair's gonna be all <i>over</i> th' place, an' I can't have it messed-up in front of <i>Sandi</i>!</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Now slowing down a bit:)</i> Okay, okay, you guys--sorry--I'm just <i>really</i> excited about this opportunity, Helen. I <i>still</i> can't believe our <i>luck</i>!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Smiles:)</i> I know what you mean, Jakey--it's wonderful that we're <i>finally</i> being <i>recognized</i> for all our hard work. Now, we can finally get the things for the girls--and <i>Darren</i> that we want.</p>

<p>JAKE: Hmmm--in <i>Darren's</i> case, Helen, have you noticed that he seems to have <i>some</i> money, and I don't mean what his--<i>(pauses:) parents</i> left him? <i>(Helen and now Quinn look at Jake inquisitively)</i> I mean, when I was out with him the other day playing golf, he <i>insisted</i> on paying the <i>steep</i> playing fee--<i>(Helen <b>glares</b> at Jake)</i> n-now <i>calm down</i>, honey--he said he wanted to <i>return</i> the favor for our kindness, so I let him pay for it just this <i>once</i>, and I happened to notice while he was taking some money out of his wallet, that I thought I saw he had a <i>Northolt Platinum Card</i>! <i>Whaho</i>! I've heard that those cards have a <i>$500,000</i> line of credit!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Stunned along with Quinn:) WHAT</i>?! Jake, you <i>had</i> to have <i>thought</i> you saw that card! I can't <i>believe</i> Darren would have <i>that</i> much money, honey!</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Yeah--I guess you're <i>right. (Eyes brighten up:)</i> Hey, there's the <i>Griffin's</i>! <i>(Pulls the car in their driveway)</i></p>


     <p>Quinn sat back in her seat and thought about what her father had said, and began to remember--the quick <i>$50</i> advance for getting her that pink silk blouse. The paying for the Circa Original--<i>$800</i>, the same night while taking her to <i>Chez Pierre</i>. Taking Sandi to <i>Pastroni's</i> and the <i>Haven</i> the same night <i>along</i> with Daria and Jane. Getting money from him over Sandi and <i>Chez Pierre</i> for tonight. She gasped, now actually wondering if Darren had more money than she thought--Quinn decided to <i>inquire</i> to Darren when she got back tonight. For the moment, Quinn turned her attention to <i>Sandi</i>. What would she be <i>wearing</i>? Could it <i>compete</i> with Quinn's outfit? She didn't have to wait long to find out, because Sandi came out of the house with Linda and Tom Griffin, and Sam and Chris. Fluffy the cat came from around the back yard.</p> 

	<p>Quinn <i>fumed</i> when she saw Sandi's attire--Sandi was wearing an even <i>more</i> expensive-looking tan-colored short-sleeved short dress with matching earrings, strapless shoes, elbow-length gloves and purse. Her hair was actually done in a swirled fashion--not that different from Quinn's own look, but even <i>more</i> stylish. Sandi smirked when she saw Quinn, stopping at the passenger door of the Lexus, then looked over <i>smugly</i> at her parents, Tom and Linda. Linda smirked when she saw Sandi's look, then <i>glared</i> at her husband, who caught his wife's look, then <i>ran</i> to Sandi, and opened the door for his daughter, who got in. Jake leaned over Helen and greeted Tom.</p>


<p>JAKE: Hey, Tom, my man! How's it hangin'?</p>

<p>TOM: It's fine, Jake--<i>(looks timidly over at Linda, who's coming over, while Sam and Chris go at it in the front yard)</i> it's--<i>fine</i>.</p> 

<p>LINDA: <i>(Smirks, in a sneer:) Hellooo</i>, Helen, Jake--I trust you'll both show my daughter a <i>nice</i> time like your <i>son</i> did last night?</p>

<p>HELEN & JAKE: <i>(Shocked:) WHAT</i>?! <i>(Quinn turns ashen, sinks slowly in the back seat, while Sandi watches her do so, and smirks)</i></p>

<p>LINDA: <i>(Looks at both of them disdainfully, then gives a wicked grin:)</i> It's <i>quite</i> true--Sandi said your son was such a--<i>tiger</i> last night--who knew Darren could be so much of a--<i>lover</i>? <i>(Quinn then grows quietly furious, while Sandi gives a triumphant smirk at her)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Tries to find the words:)</i> W-what do you <i>mean</i>, Linda? Darren was with <i>Jane</i> last night! <i>(Pauses, frowns:)</i> You <i>must</i> be <i>mistaken</i>--my son would <i>never</i>--</p>

<p>LINDA: <i>(Cold tone, cuts her off:) --No</i>. He <i>was</i> here last night--my husband and sons saw him here. According to Sandi, they had the time of their <i>lives</i> last night. <i>(Tom looks as if he's about to say something, but another quick <b>glare</b> from Linda silences him.)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Speechless:)</i> B-but <i>why</i>--</p>

<p>LINDA: --Maybe it's because he knows a <i>superior</i> girl when he <i>sees</i> one like Sandi in comparison to this <i>"Jane"</i> girl, Helen? There's <i>no</i> shame in admitting that, you know. Maybe this will be the start of something between our <i>families</i>? Darren's certainly a <i>handsome</i> fellow. <i>(Thought v.o.: Though if I weren't married to my simpleton of a husband, and if Sandi didn't like him, and if I were <b>23 years younger</b>--oh well--)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Turns to Sandi, in a low tone:) Damn it</i>, Sandi--what's goin' on here? <i>Why</i> are you sayin' all this? You know that you an' Darren didn't--</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Ditto, to Quinn, haughty:)</i> --Like, what's the matter, <i>Quh--inn</i>? If Darren and I <i>didn't</i> have such a <i>"good"</i> time, why don't you tell your <i>parents</i> about it--<i>(faux shock:) ooops</i>--that's right--you can't say anything like <i>"I was there with <b>Doreen</b> and <b>Jasmine</b>, and saw th' whole thing"</i>, 'cause you were <i>supposed</i> to be at <i>Stacy's</i> last night. <i>(Quinn looks shocked:)</i> I <i>got</i> it out of Stacy while she was falling <i>all over herself</i> this morning when she was <i>still</i> apologizing to me along with <i>Tiffany. (Smirks:)</i> You shouldn't have said <i>anything</i> to them about your <i>"punishment". (Looks away arrogantly:)</i> Oh, well--<i>(Quinn clenches her teeth, frustrated, then looks down, closes her eyes to calm herself)</i> perhaps <i>this</i> will teach you <i>once and for all</i> to not challenge my <i>authority</i> in the Fashion Club. <i>(Notices Quinn's closed eyes:)</i> Quinn, if you continue to <i>frown</i> like that, you'll get <i>worry</i> lines, and that is like, <i>sooo</i> not fashionable.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Sighs, resigned:)</i> Y-yeah, Sandi--not fashionable. <i>(Looks out of the window while Sandi looks forward haughtily)</i></p>


     <p>Helen simply became quiet, looking ahead, shocked. Jake then waved 
goodbye to the Griffins, and started to back out of the driveway.</p>


<p>HELEN: How--how could Darren <i>lie</i> like that to us, Jake? <i>Why</i> would he <i>do</i> that? <i>(Thought v.o.: Darren should <b>not</b> do something like that to Jane--I'm going to have a little <b>talk</b> with him when we get back tonight.)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: Gosh, honey, maybe he really <i>does</i> like Sandi, and didn't want to <i>hurt</i> Jane's feelings? Something could've happened <i>between</i> those two, and he decided to go out with Sandi? I mean, who are <i>we</i> to tell him who he should and shouldn't like, right? <i>(Sandi grins and <b>blushes</b>, while Quinn secretly sticks her finger in her mouth in a "barfing" mode)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: I thought for sure--<i>(pauses:)</i> I--guess, Jake--<i>(looks back, ashen:)</i> did you er, have a <i>good</i> time with my son last night, Sandi?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(A <b>very</b> big grin:)</i> Oooooh, <i>yes</i>, Mrs. Morgendorffer--Darren was like, <i>sooo</i> wonderful, an' stuff, an'--</p>


     <p>Quinn rolled her eyes in disgust, and put her hands over her face--this was going to be a <i>bad</i> night.</p>

     <p>The grey Camry that had previously followed Darren in Lawndale, now was following the Lexus from a distance, only this time it was driven by the short, beared man who had been with the red-haired goateed man in Los Angeles, known as <i>Ernie</i>, and not Oscar. He was talking on the cell phone in the car while watching the Lexus.</p>


<p>ERNIE: --Yessir, Boss--they're <i>finally</i> on their way--and with a <i>bonus</i>--you worried about how we were gonna get Darren Appleton's <i>girlfriend</i>--well, sir, she's coming <i>with</i> his birth family to you!</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Estatic:) Fantastic</i>, Ernie! This is <i>outstanding</i>--better than we planned! All right, double back to the Morgendorffer's, and continue to watch for when <i>"The Message"</i> is delivered to my <i>"nephew"--(pauses:)</i> we have another <i>20</i> minutes when that courier service is suppose to arrive. <i>(Snickering sound:)</i> I'll bet when he reads <i>"The Message"</i>, he'll <i>tear</i> out of that house like his <i>life</i> depended on it--which it <i>does</i>, but it won't matter after <i>tonight</i>, anyway. <i>Follow</i> him when he does.</p>

<p>ERNIE: <i>(Starts to turn the car down another street to head back:)</i> Right, Boss--er, what about your <i>"nephew's"</i> other sister, <i>(looks down at the pad:) Dar-ee-ah</i>? She's there with <i>another</i> girl who came up right after the Morgendorffers left to go to the Griffins.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>Damn</i>! Knowing Darren, he'll probably want to keep this <i>"Da-ri-uh"</i> and her friend <i>out</i> of it by <i>not</i> telling them--<i>(pauses:)</i> ah, so much the <i>better</i>, I suppose--don't <i>worry</i> about them, Ernie--we'll have <i>more</i> than enough <i>"insurance"</i>. Just follow Darren back to the warehouses.</p> 

<p>ERNIE: Okay, Boss. <i>(Looks up at the darkening cloudy sky:)</i> Boy, it looks like some <i>serious</i> rain is on the way, sir--I heard that there's a lot of summer storms in this part of the country this time of the year--do you think your <i>"nephew"</i> will come if there's a <i>storm</i>?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(After a moment:) Ernie</i>, is it?</p>

<p>ERNIE: Uh, yessir--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: --When I want your <i>weather report</i>, I'll <i>ask</i> for it, Ernie--my <i>"nephew"</i> will come for his birth family and girlfriend--you just follow him back here when he does, all right? <i>(Hangs up)</i></p>

<p>ERNIE: Uh, yessir. <i>(Quietly clicks off the cell phone)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the Carter County bay Warehouse District, about 15 minutes later)</i></p>



     <p>The blue Lexus came up to wooded bay inlet located beside a staggered row of about five, large, brick and wood old, two-story abandoned warehouses with some windows in at least two of them that were cracked and worn from years of abuse by rock-throwing kids, surrounded by a rusting barbed-wire fence that had fading, equally-rusting signs that said <i>"Private Property, Keep Out"</i>. There were weeds protruding out of the cracked gray asphalt. The Lexus drove through the open gate unto the old driveway beside one of the warehouses, stopped, and Jake got out. Quinn and Sandi looked at the sight and each other with horrified looks on their faces, then simultaneously formed a well-known word known throughout the Fashion Club:</p>


<p>QUINN & SANDI: EWWWWWWW!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Turns to both girls, falsetto voice:)</i> Now, girls--we <i>won't</i> be here long, and if you wish, you can <i>stay</i> in the car while we talk to this <i>"Mr. Smith"</i>, all right?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Frowns, crosses her arms:)</i> Don't worry, Mom--I'm <i>not</i> leavin' the car to go out <i>there</i>, no <i>freakin'</i> way! Do you know what that <i>ground</i> out there could do to my <i>high-heeled</i> designer shoes?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Ditto:)</i> Yeah, and how about what the sea <i>air</i> would do to my <i>face</i>! Can you, like, <i>imagine</i> the <i>dryness</i> that could occur to it?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Mumbles to herself, looks out over the place again:)</i> One could only <i>hope</i> what the air would do to your face, Sandi.</p>

<p>HELEN: Well, all right, girls--we'll see you in a few. <i>(Turns around, leaves to follow Jake)</i></p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Glares:)</i> Quinn, like, when you said your parents had to make a little "stop" before we went to <i>Chez Pierre</i>, you never said we'd be stopping at <i>this</i> dump!</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Ditto:)</i> Well, <i>I</i> didn't know they meant <i>here</i>, Sandi! I thought it would be at some <i>store</i>, or something!</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Looks around, motions with her arms:)</i> Does all of this <i>look</i> like a <i>store</i>, Quh--inn?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> Well, of <i>course</i> not, Sandi--maybe my parents wanta talk to this guy about a new type of <i>fabric</i>, or something.</p>

<p>SANDI: One can only <i>hope</i>, Quinn--though I think a <i>better</i> place could've been chosen, such as <I>Cashman's</I>, or the <I>mall</I>.</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Waves in a nonchalant way:)</I> Oh, most <I>definitely</I>, Sandi.</P> 


     <P>Meanwhile, Jake and Helen looked around, confused.</P>


<P>JAKE: We're here, honey--where in the <I>hell</I> is this "Smith" guy?</P>

<P>HELEN: Um, yes--what <I>is</I> going on here? We <I>are</I> on time. You don't think--</P>


     <P>Suddenly, coming from around one of the warehouses, <I>three</I> masked men armed with guns came towards Helen, Jake, and the Lexus.</P>


<P>JAKE: <I>(Grins when he sees them:)</I> Hey, what's goin' on, fellows? Are you guys here to provide some sort of <I>protection</I> for <I>"Mr. Smith's"</I> product? Kinda <I>warm</I> for those masks, dontcha think, guys?</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Becomes alarmed, backs away from the men:)</I> Uh, Jake, I don't think they're here for <I>"protection"</I>--</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Wide-eyed:)</I> W-what's happening?</P>

<P>SANDI: <I>(Ditto:)</I> Errr, Quinn--is this some sort of <I>revenge</I> against <I>me</I> for <I>Darren</I>? If so, you're <I>not</I> going to get the presidentcy, and you risk being put <I>out</I> of the Fashion Club for <I>good</I> this time!</P>

<P>MAN #1: <I>(Calmly to Helen:)</I> Put up your hands, please. If you <I>cooperate</I>, nothing will happen to you.</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Starts to get angry, shakes with rage:) Cooperate</I>? <I>COOPERATE</I>? WHO-IN-THE-HELL-ARE-YOU-GUYS?!</P>

<P>MAN #2: <I>(Walks up, points his gun nozzle <B>between</B> Jake's eyes, still-calm-voice:) We're</I> the <I>"guys"</I> with <I>guns</I>, and <I>you're</I> the people who're going to do <I>exactly</I> what you're told if you want to leave here <I>alive</I>. Anymore <I>questions</I>?</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Terrified, while hands put up:) JAKE</I>!</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Frantic:) DADDY</I>!</P>

<P>SANDI: <I>(Ditto:) HEEEEEELP</I>! IT'S <I>THEM</I> YOU WANT--I'M <I>TOO, TOO</I> VALUABLE! <I>(Quinn glares at Sandi)</I></P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Suddenly calm now, in a meek voice:) N-no</I>, sir! N-no questions at <I>all</I>!</P>

<P>MAN #2: Good. <I>(Motions with his gun:)</I> Move. <I>(Jake does with his hands put up)</I></P>

<P>MAN #3: Okay, you two--out of the car. <I>(Quinn and Sandi get out, and follow Jake and Helen, with the three men behind)</I></P>


     <P>Everyone went into the middle warehouse, and came into a series of small, abandoned rooms--formally offices for management. Jake, Helen, Quinn, and Sandi were put into one of the cobweb-filled rooms, which were dimly lightly by portable lights, and were forced to sit down, and be tied up back-to-back in chairs. The men then left the room, shutting the door. Jake then barely turned his head to Helen, and spoke.</P>


<P>JAKE: Honey, what's goin' on? Is this some way to <I>treat</I> a person whose gonna make you <I>millions</I> of bucks?</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Through clenched teeth:) Jake! (Sighs:)</I> I think it's obvious they <I>want</I> us for something--<I>(narrows eyes:)</I> but for <I>what</I>? What could we possibly <I>have</I> that these men want?</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Whines:)</I> This isn't <I>fair</I>! I just had my nails <I>manicured</I>! These ropes are gonna <I>mess</I> them up!</P>

<P>SANDI: <I>(Ditto:)</I> And don't forget about our <I>wrists</I>! These <I>icky</I> ropes will <I>scratch</I> our <I>delicate</I> skin! <I>(Looks at far corner, screams:)</I> AH! A <I>RAT</I>!</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Screams, looks around:)</I> WHERE, <I>WHERE</I>?!</P>

<P>SANDI: <I>(Motions her head in the direction of the rat:) OVER THERE</I>!</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Looks around, frantic as well:)</I> OH, DEAR LORD! JAKE, <I>DO</I> SOMETHING!</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Utterly lost:)</I> Geez, honey--I can't <I>move</I>! If we don't do anything, <I>it</I> won't! <I>(Adds:)</I> After all--the <I>cheese</I> isn't on your <I>heads</I>!</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Sees the rat, now:)</I> EEEEK! THERE IT IS!</P>

<P>SANDI: SOMEBODY <I>DO</I> SOMETHING!</P>


     <P>As if on cue, one of the masked men came in, and suddenly pulled out his gun, and <I>shot</I> the rat, which when up about <I>ten</I> feet in the air, and landed with a <I>thump</I>. Helen, Quinn, and Sandi looked at what happened, horrified, while Jake simply looked <I>awed</I>.</P>


<P>MAN: There! That rat won't <I>bother</I> you anymore! Now, <I>shut up</I> and behave! <I>(Prepares to close the door)</I></P>

<P>HELEN: <I>Wait</I>! Why are you <I>doing</I> this? If it's <I>money</I> you want--</P>

<P>MAN: <I>(Chuckles, amused:)</I> Lady, <I>your</I> money couldn't <I>compare</I> to <I>this</I> money! Look, just do as you're told, and you and your family and friends will <I>live</I>, okay? <I>(Shuts door)</I></P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(After a moment:)</I> Gosh, what'd he mean by <I>"Your money couldn't compare to <B>this</B> money"</I>, Helen?</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Sighs, looks down:)</I> I--don't know, Jakey.</P>

<P>QUINN: D-Daddy? M-mom? I'm <I>s-scared</I>.</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Coos, tries to soothe Quinn's fears:)</I> Shhhh--we'll be <I>fine</I>, sweetie--<I>(strains to look behind her:) right</I>, Jake?</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Looks down, sniffs:)</I> Oh, <I>God</I>--my life has been <I>such</I> a waste--</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Furious:) --JAKE</I>!</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Snaps out of it:) Huh</I>? Oh, uh, <I>yeah</I>, that's right, Quinn! We'll come out smellin' like a <I>rose</I>! Even now, your ol' dad's comin' up with a <I>plan</I> to get us <I>out</I> of here!</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Hopeful:) Really</I>, Daddy?</P>

<P>JAKE: Oh yeah, sweetie! <I>(Lowers voice:)</I> Helen, <I>you</I> thought of anything, yet? <I>(Helen rolls her eyes and sighs, looks up, exasperated)</I></P>

<P>SANDI: <I>(Tries to put up a brave front:)</I> N-now, Quinn--w-we have to be a-above it <I>all</I>--to panic is <I>soooo</I> unfashionable! We c-can't afford to, like, have <I>tears</I> mess up our <I>clothes</I> an' all--and--and--<I>(starts to weep silently so Quinn would not hear her, which Helen sees, and takes <B>pity</B> on Sandi)</I></P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Using the same tone on Sandi as on Quinn, but even lower on Sandi:)</I> It'll be <I>okay</I>, Sandi--you'll see. <I>(Sandi looks up at Helen, her mascara running, but smiles a little, which Helen returns)</I> Hmm--maybe--maybe they'll <I>question</I> why we haven't arrived at <I>Chez Pierre</I> for our reservations.</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Starts to smile:) Heeey</I>, that's <I>right</I>! They'll call our home, and wonder <I>where</I> we are, and Daria and Darren will eventually call the <I>cops</I> when we're reported <I>missing</I>!</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Perks up, gasps:) Yeah</I>! They do that <I>all</I> the time when people don't show up! <I>I</I> ought to know!</P>

<P>SANDI: <I>(Perks up as well:)</I> Like, it's <I>possible</I>, right?</P>


     <P>At that moment, one of the masked men came in.</P>


<P>MAN: Sorry to <I>burst</I> your <I>"bubble"</I>, but we just <I>abruptly</I> called and <I>cancelled</I> your reservations to <I>Chez Pierre</I>. Remember, you told <I>"Mr. Smith"</I> where you wanted to go after you "met" him.</P> 

<P>HELEN: <I>(Angered:)</I> You certainly can't believe you can keep us here, and no one would <I>notice</I> that we're <I>gone</I>, do you? We're <I>well known</I> around Lawndale!</P>

<P>MAN: Lady, if things go well, we'll be <I>gone</I> by <I>midnight</I> from here, and you guys can go <I>home</I>, and it won't matter what <I>anybody</I> around here does. All we need is a few <I>hours</I>--now, <I>pipe down. (Shuts door)</I></P>


     <P>Everyone grew quiet--so much for <I>that</I> idea.</P>



<P><I>(Scene changes to the Morgendorffer's, the same time)</I></P>



     <P>Daria was sitting on the right couch, and Jane and Darren were sitting together on the left couch, sharing popcorn and watching <I>Sick, Sad World</I>. On the TV was that familiar woman with the British accent talking to a dirt farmer with a country twang in a potato field.</P>


<P>INTERVIEWER: And you say that the ground <I>swallowed</I> you up <I>whole</I>?</P>

<P>INTERVIEWEE: That there's <I>right</I>, ma'am--I was trying to collect my crop of potatoes, an' then I fell into another <I>world</I> that had <I>underground</I> people in it!</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Offscreen:) Jules Verne</I>, take a <I>bow. (Darren is heard chuckling)</I></P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Offscreen:)</I> I wonder if he's found that huge lost nugget of <I>gold</I> in the center of the earth? <I>(Darren is now heard laughing harder)</I></P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Offscreen:)</I> If he did, do you think <I>"Ol' MacDonald"</I> there would <I>still</I> be a farmer?</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Offscreen:)</I> Good point.</P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Offscreen, gets in on the "action":)</I> Hey, I thought <I>"MacDonald"</I> there was giving out <I>"Happy Meals"</I> while singing <I>"Icebox Woman"</I>.</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Offscreen:)</I> Oh, he <I>still</I> does, bro--this is just his <I>part</I> time job--<I>someone</I> has to grow those potatoes where the fries come from. It's the <I>only</I> good thing about <I>"Mickey D's"</I> left. <I>(Darren is heard laughing again)</I></P>

<P>JANE: <I>(After a moment, offscreen:)</I> Uh--you guys have now completely <I>lost</I> me.</P>




     <P>The doorbell then rang. Daria was about to get up, but Darren got up instead.</P>


<P>DARREN: Relax, sis--I'll get it--you two continue your <I>"reviews"</I> of the show. <I>(Goes to the door)</I></P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Leans over to Daria, low voice, smirks:)</I> Darren could probably <I>buy</I> that nugget of gold, you know.</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Smirks back:)</I> Either that, or he'd pay an <I>expedition</I> to go and <I>get</I> it so he could have it himself. <I>(Reaches over and gets some popcorn)</I></P>


     <P>Darren opened the door and saw the <I>same</I> courier that brought he and his birth family the <I>first</I> DNA results (his name is <I>"Luthor"</I>, remember). Luthor had a white envelope, and presented it to him.</P>


<P>LUTHOR: Hello--are you <I>Darren Coverton</I>?</P>


     <P>Darren <I>froze</I>--who knew he was using his "phony" last name here other than his aunt Millie, uncle Will, Curtis, Elenor, and Claude? Could it have been one of <I>them</I>? Wouldn't they have just <I>called</I> him if--</P>


<P>LUTHOR: <I>(Snaps him out of his thoughts:)</I> Sir, are you Darren Coverton?</P>

<P>DARREN: Eh? Oh, uh, yes, I <I>suppose</I> I am. <I>(Takes envelope, signs:)</I> Thank you--<I>(starts to reach for his wallet)</I></P>

<P>LUTHOR: <I>(Backs up, holds up his hands, smirks:)</I> Oh, no you don't--I'm not gonna <I>fall</I> for that <I>trick</I> again! <I>(Takes off, jumps in his truck, and drives off)</I></P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Stares after him, closes the door:)</I> There's <I>no</I> doubt about it now--most of these people <I>are</I> crazy around here. <I>(Looks down at envelope, then opens it, takes a letter out, and reads it)</I></P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><TT><P ALIGN=LEFT> Dear Mr. "Coverton":
<BR>
 As of this moment, your birth family and girlfriend are being held at a place called the <B>Carter County Bay Warehouse District</B>--you should be <B>familiar</B> with hearing that--it was used to <B>lure</B> them there. If you want to see them alive, then come <B>alone</B> right now, and <B>immediately</B>--tell no one. No police, of course. If a siren is as so much as even <B>heard</B>--fire, and ambulance, even--your family and girlfriend are <B>dead</B>. We're also <B>watching</B> for any <B>suspicious</B> activity as well--if we see anyone that even <B>looks</B> like a law enforcement officer, your family and girlfriend are <B>dead</B>. Surely you wouldn't want to lose <B>them</B> like you did your <B>adopted</B> parents, would you? We think not. We assume that you probably have a <B>map</B> of the entire area of Lawndale to get there, so you shouldn't have any <B>trouble</B> in finding where we are. You have <B>20</B> minutes to find where it's at. We're waiting, now--the clock is <B>ticking</B>. See you then.</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>


     <P>Darren turned <I>pale</I>, shocked, and his heart <I>raced</I> with fear. <I>You <B>fool</B>--you should have known--that place, wherever it was, was <B>out</B> of the way! If they die, it's <B>your</B> fault!</I> The killer or killers had <I>found</I> Darren, but instead of going after <I>him</I>, they did the <I>worst</I> possible thing--they <I>kidnapped</I> Helen, Jake, Quinn, and--and--his <I>girlfriend</I>? He looked over at Jane. <I><B>She's</B> my girlfriend. Who were they talking about?</I> Darren frowned for a second, then came to a realization--<I>Sandi Griffin</I> had to be the <I>"girlfriend"</I>--she was to go along with the Morgendorffers tonight, but <I>why</I> would they think <I>she</I> was his girlfriend? Darren now figured that someone <i>was</i> watching him all of this time, though he couldn't be sure how long it had been going on--perhaps since he <i>first</i> got here? He looked over at Daria and Jane, who were <I>absorbed</I> into the <I>Sick, Sad World</I> show. <I>Thank God they weren't caught. I'll have to leave them out of this.</I> It was at that moment that Daria looked over at Darren, and spoke.</P>


<P>DARIA: Who was that, bro?</P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Frantic, scrambles for an excuse:)</I> It--was--someone asking for <I>directions</I>, that's all.</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Now looks as well:)</I> Hey, why didn't you just ask one of <I>us</I>, Darren? We could've told them--</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Smirks:)</I> --To go to <I>hell</I>, that is. <I>(Jane chuckles)</I></P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Waves them off:)</I> No, no--it was to a place that I'm <I>familiar</I> with--er, <I>Dega Street</I>--besides, you guys were really into <I>Sick, Sad World</I>, and I didn't want to disturb you. <I>(Pauses:)</I> Er, will you two <I>excuse</I> me for a moment? I've got to run upstairs and use the--uh, <I>bathroom. (Suddenly rushes up the stairs)</I></P>


     <P>Daria and Jane looked at each other, perplexed.</P>


<P>JANE: <I>(Arched eyebrow:)</I> Boy, he must really have to go <I>badly</I>, huh?</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Turns back to the TV:)</I> This ep would want to make <I>anybody</I> go the can. <I>(Jane chuckles, and resumes watching the TV with Daria)</I></P>


     <P>Darren rushed into his room, and grabbed his keys and the map of Lawndale he had used on his jogs when he first came. He then turned back, and hurried out. He stopped at the top of the stairs and slowly came down them, watching carefully to see if Daria or Jane would notice him. When he saw that they were once again absorbed in the TV, he looked at both of them <I>longingly</I> for a moment--wondering for a moment if this would be the <I>last</I> time he saw them, then quietly slipped out of the front door, and rushed to his car. He got in, put the key into the ignition, shifted his car into neutral, and <I>coasted</I> the car into the street, so as not to let either of the girls hear the car, and started it up, slowly accelerating down the street.</P>

     <P>Ernie, who had watched the scene from in the gray Camry down the street, immediately dialed on his cell phone after starting up his car, and started to follow Darren from a distance. The sky had grown <I>very</I> dark, and it had began to rain.</P> 


<P>ERNIE: <I>(Grins:)</I> Boss? Your <I>"nephew's"</I> on his way, and he's as <I>agitated</I> as you thought he'd be.</P>

<P>WILLIAM: Let the "show" begin!</P>



<P><I>(Scene changes to the warehouse)</I></P>



     <P>William clicked off his cell phone, and got out of his minivan, which was located <I>inside</I> one of the warehouses along with some other vehicles and equipment, including now the Morgendorffer's blue Lexus. The lighting was dim inside the large bay, which was almost ringed by a railed, wide ledge located about twenty feet in the air. The rain was heard outside, pelting the roof. There were occasional bursts of thunder and lightning intermingled with the rain, and some wind as well. One of the men came into the bay, and took off his mask--it was <I>Benny Lodell</I>. He came up beside William, who was now looking over a very-nervous Sam Norwood's legal paperwork concerning forcing Darren to give up the Appleton conglomerate on a makeshift "desk", a long, old board suspended between two old barrels.</P>


<P>WILLIAM: Hmph--everything <I>seems</I> to be in order on my final check on these legal documents here, Norwood.</P> 

<P>NORWOOD: T-thank you, Boss. <I>(Wipes his forehead with a hankerchief:)</I> I-I'll be glad when this is <I>over</I>.</P>

<P>WILLIAM: <I>(Looks up from the files:)</I> Eh? Something wrong, Norwood?</P>

<P>NORWOOD: <I>(Gulps, then goes on:)</I> W-well, Boss--are you <I>sure</I> we should <I>do</I> this? I mean, I don't think <I>much</I> of Darren Appleton either, b-but <I>murder</I>?</P> 

<P>WILLIAM: <I>(Scowls with Benny:)</I> Where in the <I>hell</I> did <I>this</I> come from, Norwood? Are you beginning to have <I>second</I> thoughts about this?</P>

<P>NORWOOD: <I>(Frantic:) N-no</I> sir! I-I'm just wondering if there wasn't <I>another</I> way we could've <I>handled</I> this, that's all! I-I've never been <I>directly</I> involved in a murder before, Boss.</P>

<P>BENNY: <I>(Snickers, rolls his eyes:) Never</I>--? You're <I>kidding</I>, right? You represented <I>Mafia</I> figures for <I>years</I>! Surely you <I>had</I> to have known they were <I>involved</I> in killing people who didn't pay them <I>"protection"</I> money, or had gone after their <I>rivals</I>!</P>

<P>NORWOOD: W-well, I didn't want to <I>know</I> if they did, so I kind of put it in the <I>back</I> of my <I>mind</I> and just thought of them as my <I>"clients"</I>.</P>

<P>WILLIAM: <I>(Wicked smile, pats Norwood on the back:)</I> And you <I>sold out</I> your <I>soul</I> in the process, you old <I>dog</I>! <I>(Norwood sighs, and looks down)</I> Well, <I>tough</I>--you're in this as <I>deep</I> as we are, Norwood, so <I>shape up--(smile leaves William's face, replaced by an intense glare:) got</I> that?</P>

<P>NORWOOD: <I>(Draws back, cowers:)</I> Y-yessir, Boss, y-you can <I>count</I> on me, sir!</P>

<P>WILLIAM: <I>(Wicked smug:) Good</I>--I wouldn't want you to end up like <I>Sanchez. (Norwood trembles with fear)</I></P>


     <P>The other two masked men came into the bay area from the outside thru a garage-sized metal door, soaking wet. Both took off their masks to reveal <I>Bert</I> and <I>Oscar</I>. William scowled at Oscar.</P>


<P>WILLIAM: Oscar! Why aren't you outside watching for my <I>"nephew"</I>? </P>

<P>OSCAR: But Boss--it's coming down <I>cats and dogs</I> out there!</P> 


     <P>William stared at Oscar stoically for a moment, then suddenly pulled out <I>his</I> gun from a holster he had around his shoulder and waist, and pointed it at <I>Oscar</I>, who backed up in fear. Bert backed away from Oscar.</P>


<P>WILLIAM: Get <I>out</I> there and watch for my <I>"nephew"</I>, or the <I>next</I> thing that'll be <I>"coming down"</I> in <I>here</I> will be your <I>blood</I>! Got that?</P>

<P>OSCAR: <I>(Backing up, wide-eyed:)</I> Y-yessir! <I>(Goes back through the door)</I></P>


     <P>Benny, Norwood, and Bert looked at each other warily. The <I>"Boss"</I> was playing for <I>keeps</I>, even to those who worked <I>with</I> him--best not to <I>"upset the apple cart"</I>--or <I>William</I> himself. William watched Oscar leave, then put the gun back in its place.</P>


<P>WILLIAM: <I>(Turns back to Benny, low voice:)</I> You've got to make sure you mean <I>business</I> when it comes to <I>"those people"</I>, Benny--otherwise, they'll take you for all that you're <I>worth</I>.</P>

<P>BENNY: <I>(Blinks foolishly:)</I> Y-yessir.</P>

<P>WILLIAM: <I>(Resumes normal tone of voice, slaps his hands suddenly together, startles the others:) Well</I>! Let's prepare to <I>meet</I> my <I>"nephew"</I>, eh? <I>(Smirks wickedly, sneers:)</I> I can't <I>wait</I> to see Darren's <I>face</I> when he finds out who killed his dear <I>"parents". (Walks back to the minivan, rummages through the icebox, gets a bottle of water and drinks it)</I></P>



<P><I>(Scene changes to the Morgendorffer's, the same time)</I></P>



     <P>Daria clicked off the TV with the remote when <I>Sick, Sad World</I> went off, while Jane got up to stretch. Daria looked at her watch.</P>


<P>DARIA: Hey, we've got another <I>hour</I> before Mystik Spiral arrives at <I>McGrudy's. (Looks up:)</I> Where in the hell is <I>Darren</I>? He's taking a mighty <I>long</I> time in the bathroom--<I>(slight concern:)</I> you don't think he's <I>ill</I> or something?</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Smirks, mocking tone:) Awww</I>--is <I>"widdle sister"</I> worried about her <I>"big brudder-wudder"</I>? <I>(Shrugs while Daria frowns at her:)</I> Hey, he could be up in his room calling one of his <I>friends</I>, or something.</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Sighs:)</I> I guess--let's go upstairs and find out when he wants to go.</P> 


     <P>Daria and Jane were about to go up the stairs when the doorbell rang. Daria opened the door and saw a burly Asian-American man with two other men standing behind him in the rain.</P> 


<P>DARIA: <I>(Eyebrow cocked:) Yeess</I>?</P>

<P>MAN: <I>(Reaches into his coat lapel, shows I.D.:)</I> Good evening, miss--my name is <I>Gerald Woo</I>, and I'm a detective--is Darren er, <I>Coverton</I> here?</P>


     <P>Daria and Jane looked at each other, surprised.</P>


<P>DARIA: Gerald Woo--the <I>detective</I> that my bro hired to find my family?</P> 

<P>WOO: <I>(Eyebrows raised:)</I> He <I>told</I> you about me? <I>(Both girls nod)</I> Oh well, I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose--and the name is just <I>Woo. (Motions to his men behind him:)</I> This is <I>Leroy</I> and <I>David</I>. I wanted to know if we could <I>speak</I> to him, Miss--</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>Daria Morgendorffer</I>. Call me <I>"Daria"</I>.</P>

<P>JANE: <I>Jane Lane</I>. Call me <I>"Jane"</I>.</P>

<P>LEROY: <I>(Shivers with David:)</I> Uh, Woo? It's kind of getting <I>wet</I> out here--?</P> 

<P>WOO: Eh? Oh, of course--may we--?</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Stands aside with Jane:)</I> C'mon into the living room--I'll call Darren. <I>(Goes to the bottom of the stairs shouts up:)</I> Hey, Darren--you've got <I>company</I>! <I>(Pauses, no response:) Darren</I>?! Hmmm. Would you all excuse me for a sec? Make yourselves at home. <I>(Goes up stairs)</I></P>

<P>WOO: Thank you, Daria. <I>(Takes off coat with the others, hangs them on a coat rack in the living room near the door)</I></P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Smirks:)</I> Caught out in the rain <I>without</I> an umbrella, eh?</P>

<P>WOO: I'm afraid so, Jane--we just came across the <I>country</I> from your airport--we didn't know about the forcast for rain, or we would've had hats and umbrellas.</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Cocks an eyebrow:) Across</I> the country? Where'd you guys come from?</P>

<P>DAVID: <I>Los Angeles</I>.</P>

<P>WOO: Yes, you see--</P>


    <P>Daria <I>hurried</I> back down the stairs, interrupting Woo's talk, and immediately went to the front door while drawing perplexed looks from everyone, and gave a brief look-see outside, quickly shutting the door back, more from <I>confirmation</I> than the driving rainstorm outside. She then came back into the living room, puzzled.</P> 


<P>JANE: Daria? What's up? Where's Darren?</P>

<P>DARIA: That's what <I>I'd</I> like to know. He's <I>not</I> upstairs, and his car's <I>gone. (Woo and his men look at each other)</I></P>

<P>JANE: <I>Gone</I>? You mean he's not here? <I>(Daria gives her a look that says, "Duh", which Jane does not notice)</I> Why would he <I>leave</I> all of a sudden like that? <I>(Pauses:)</I> And for <I>that</I> matter, why not tell <I>us</I>? This doesn't make any <I>sense</I> at all.</P>


     <P>Woo was about to say something when the phone on the coffee table rang. Daria picked it up and clicked it on.</P>


<P>DARIA: Hello?</P>

<P>VOICE: <I>(Sounding snooty:)</I> Yes, is this the <I>Morgendorffer</I> residence?</P>

<P>DARIA: People <I>live</I> here by that name, yes.</P>

<P>VOICE: This is <I>Chez Pierre</I>--when you <I>abruptly</I> cancelled your dinner reservations for tonight, you got off the phone so <I>fast</I>, you forgot to <I>reschedule. (Daria frowns, perplexed)</I> We certainly don't want to <I>lose</I> such <I>valuable</I> customers--particularly a <I>Quinn Morgendorffer</I>. Does she <I>live</I> there as well?</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>Unfortunately</I>, yes--<I>(pauses:)</I> er, we'll have to get <I>back</I> with you on that rescheduling, okay?</P>

<P>VOICE: Of course--thank you, and have a <I>pleasant</I> evening. <I>(Hangs up)</I></P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Clicks off the phone:)</I> That <I>depends</I>. I just received some <I>very</I> interesting information. The reservations my parents had at <I>Chez Pierre</I> were suddenly <I>cancelled. (Jane raises an eyebrow, while Woo and his men look at each other again)</I> Why wouldn't my parents <I>call</I> us and say anything?</P>

<P>JANE: Maybe they went somewhere <I>else</I> at the last second, because their meeting with this <I>"Smith"</I> guy went a little <I>too</I> long, and they decided to eat somewhere <I>else</I>? Remember, your parents thought we were going to <I>McGrundy's</I>, so they probably assumed we'd be <I>gone</I> by now, and didn't <I>bother</I> to call us?</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Ponders:)</I> Maybe--but that still doesn't explain <I>Darren's</I> absence from our premises.</P>

<P>WOO: <I>(Steps up:)</I> Uh, excuse me, but <I>who</I> is this <I>"Smith"</I> fellow?</P>

<P>DARIA: He's some guy that called my parents late last night, and wanted them to see some <I>dumb</I> "product" he <I>invented</I>, or something. Both of them thought it was some sort of <I>"incredible good fortune"</I> to make some <I>serious</I> money. My mom claimed he was a quote, <I>"aspiring inventor that <B>inherited</B> a rather <B>large</B> amount of <B>money</B> from a <B>dead</B> relative"--</I></P>

<P>WOO: <I>(Cuts her off, urgent tone, put his hands on her shoulders:) --"Inherited money from a dead relative"</I>? Are you <I>sure</I> about this, Daria?</P>  

<P>DARIA: <I>(Looks uncomfortablely at Woo's hand's:)</I> Umm--<I>yeeees</I>--what does that mean?</P>

<P>WOO: It could mean that your brother and your family are in <I>deadly</I> danger, Daria. <I>(Daria and Jane look shocked) Where</I> is this <I>"place"</I> your parents are suppose to meet this <I>"Smith"</I> fellow?</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Recovers:)</I> At a bunch of old warehouses that comprise an area we call the <I>Carter County Bay Warehouse District</I> near Lawndale--it's almost in the middle of <I>"Nowheresville"</I>.</P> 

<P>WOO: <I>(Grabs his coat:)</I> Come on, gentlemen--let's go--<I>(David and Leroy grab their coats)</I></P>

<P>JANE: <I>(After glancing at Daria, frowns:)</I> Hey, just one <I>damn</I> minute! What in the <I>hell</I> is going on?! You tell us that Darren and Daria's family is in <I>"deadly danger"</I>, and then you just <I>cut out</I> on us?!</P>

<P>WOO: <I>(Opens the front door, David and Leroy rush out:)</I> I'm sorry, Jane, but we can't <I>explain</I> right now--<I>(starts to leave)</I></P>

<P>DARIA: --Um, before you go, you're gonna need to <I>know</I> something--</P>

<P>WOO: <I>(Rushed:)</I> --What's that, Daria?</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>How</I> are you gonna <I>get</I> there if you don't know <I>where</I> it is? <I>(Jane smirks at Woo)</I></P>


     <P>Woo paused, sighed, and motioned to the front door, and Daria and Jane started to go out.</P>


<P>WOO: Aren't you going to get a <I>coat</I> or something?</P>

<P>DARIA: Nah--<I>we</I> can survive the <I>rain</I>--I'm more worried about my <I>family</I> and <I>bro</I> surviving if you're right about them being in <I>"deadly danger"</I>.</P>

<P>WOO: Very well. <I>(Follows Daria and Jane out through the heavy rain to the rental car, gets in the back with Daria and Jane)</I></P>


     <P>As David was backing out of the driveway, Jane turned to Woo.</P>


<P>JANE: Just out of curiousity--does this have anything to do with Darren's <I>real</I> last name of <I>"Appleton"</I>?</P>

<P>WOO: <I>(Shocked with his men:)</I> Y-you <I>know</I> about Darren's real last name?</P>

<P>DARIA: Yeah--we found out about it this morning, but we didn't say <I>anything</I> to him--we figured <I>"Arthur Appleton Jr."</I> wanted to have some <I>privacy</I> before he told us who he really was, and after everything he's gone through with his adopted parents and dead fiancee, we didn't want to <I>add</I> to his <I>"woes"</I> by asking him certain--<I>questions</I>.</P> 


     <P>Woo grew quiet, and he glanced at his men. Daria and Jane watched them, intrigued.</P>


<P>WOO: <I>(Sighs:)</I> Despite all that you've just told me, that's only a <I>small</I> part of it, Daria, Jane--while you're directing us to this place, I'll give you two the <I>full</I> story of <I>why</I> Darren did what he did. <I>(Daria and Jane look at each other, then listen as Woo begins his story)</I></P>



<P><I>(Scene changes to Darren's car, the same time)</I></P>



     <P>The thoughts were flowing through Darren's mind at an <I>incredible</I> pace, almost as fast as his <I>heart</I> rate as he was driving through the heavy rain. His parents and <I>gi--Sandi</I> were held hostage by the <I>same</I> people who had <I>killed</I> his parents through Sanchez. He frowned and clenched his teeth--if they did <I>anything</I> to his family--<I>easy, Darren--they want <B>you</B>, not them, only using them as <B>bait</B> to get to you--you <B>hope</B>.</I> If there was anything <I>good</I> in any of this <I>nightmare</I>, it was at least he'd get to <I>see</I> who hired Sanchez. <I>Who</I> would it be? It <I>had</I> to be someone at Appleton, but <I>why</I> go after his <I>family</I>? Why not <I>him</I>?</P>

     <P>Darren stopped at an intersection, and snatched his map of Lawndale up to look at where this <I>"Carter County Bay Warehouse District"</I> was. He was sure he was going in the <I>right</I> direction as he traced his finger along the route, then turned left. Darren glanced at his watch--there were <I>10</I> minutes remaining. He held back his <I>fear</I> that if he didn't get there in time, that they'd--<I>no, don't think about that, keep going.</I> He absentmindedly caught a glimpse of a lighted billboard on the side of the road as he was driving by it. It said:</P>


<blockquote><font face="impact"><h4>"Get Mental In the Morning" on <u>Zee-93!</u> Catch The news, weather, and sports at 11:30 a.m. on the radio with Sal "Our Pal" Benidino!</h4></font></blockquote>


<P><I>(Note to reader: Of course, the "Zee-93" radio station comes from the ep "Jake of Hearts")</I></P>


     <P>Darren's thoughts suddenly <I>froze. 11:30</I>. Why did that time seem so <I>familiar</I>? The flashbacks then began to run through his mind:</P>


     <P>He had been called at <I>11:30 p.m.</I> that <I>hellish</I> night, and being told of the crash.</P>

     <P>The NTSB spokesman had said:</P>

     <P><I>"Now the jet with Arthur and Lucille Appleton and the crew went off the radar screen at about <B>11:25 p.m. E.D.T., 9:25 M.D.T.</B>, and the wreckage was not located until around <B>12:00 a.m. E.D.T.</B>, 10:00 p.m. M.D.T., then around <B>12:15 a.m. E.D.T.</B>, 10:15 p.m. M.D.T., the <B>first</B> reports came in that the plane had crashed, based on..."</I></P>


     <P>It all <I>hit</I> him at once--Darren tried to hold back the <I>tears of sadness, shock</I>, and <I>rage</I> that were threatening to <I>explode</I> from his eyes while still driving. It couldn't be <I>him</I>--it just <I>couldn't</I> be. Darren was beginning to <I>trust</I> him, and he had played him for a <I>fool</I>.</P>



<P><I>(Scene changes to the room where Helen, Jake, Quinn, and Sandi are being held)</I></P>



     <P>Quinn and Sandi were trying to deal with the situation as best as they could by talking about and comparing the latest <I>fashion styles</I>, while Helen and Jake were quietly contemplating to themselves, with Helen thinking about Daria and Darren, secretly relieved that they were at least at <I>McGrundy's</I>, and not here, while Jake was thinking about--about--well, just <I>thinking</I>. Helen broke his train of thought when she spoke in a very low <I>nervous</I> whisper, so as not to <I>alarm</I> Quinn or Sandi.</P>


<P>HELEN: Jake?</P>

<P>JAKE: Hmm--oh, huh, Helen?</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>What</I> were you thinking about, sweetie? You seem so <I>quiet</I>.</P>

<P>JAKE: Uh, ah, <I>nothing</I> in particular, honey. My mind was in a <I>blank. (Pauses:)</I> What were <I>you</I> thinking about?</P>


     <P>Helen thought about answering, but decided that there was <I>enough</I> tension in the air--why <I>add</I> to it?</P>


<P>HELEN: <I>(Sighs, looks down:) Nothing</I>, dear--like you, I was thinking of--nothing.</P>


     <P>Outside, Darren's car pulled up to the old warehouses in the downpour. A throughly <I>drenched</I> Oscar, who was stationed on the roof on the middle warehouse, started to call on his (waterproofed) cell phone.</P>


<P>OSCAR: <I>(Shouts in the cell phone over the rain:)</I> Boss?! He's <I>here</I>!</P>

<P>WILLIAM: Good. Is he <I>alone</I>?</P>


   <P>Oscar looked through the wind-driven rain to the surrounding woods as best he could.</P>


<P>OSCAR: None that I can see, Boss--he's <I>alone</I>! <I>(Pauses:)</I> Boss, can't I come <I>down</I> now?! I think I'm catching a <I>cold</I>!</P>

<P>WILLIAM: Oh, very <I>well</I>--taking into consideration my <I>"nephew's"</I> martial art <I>abilities</I>, another body might not be a <I>bad</I> idea. You may come down, Oscar.</P>

<P>OSCAR: <I>(Relieved:)</I> Thanks, Boss! <I>(Starts to go down by a door on the roof)</I></P>



     <P>Darren got out of his car through the heavy rain. As soon as he did, he saw a garage-sized door from the middle warehouse slide open. After a momentary pause, he slowly walked towards it, and into the warehouse.</P>

     <P>As the soggy-Darren came into the warehouse, the door suddenly slid shut behind him, and he found himself in almost <I>total</I> darkness and silence, save for a small <I>spotlight</I> in the middle of the warehouse, and the sound of the rain outside. In the middle of the spotlight was a simple wooden <I>chair</I>. Darren walked towards the spotlighted chair, and when he had come into the spotlight, he suddenly <I>shouted</I> in a <I>rage</I>, his face filled with <I>fury</I>.</P>


<P>DARREN: <I>(Looks around:)</I> Come on out, <I>Uncle Will</I>! I know you had <I>something</I> to do with <I>killing</I> my parents! Didn't you?! <I>(Pauses:) DIDN'T YOU</I>?!</P>


     <P>The spotlight widened a bit more to show a <I>calm</I> William standing near the edge of the darkness.</P>


<P>WILLIAM: <I>(In a calm tone:) Well. (Pauses:)</I> How'd you <I>figure</I> it out? For a while, <I>"nephew"</I>, I thought I had <I>overestimated</I> you.</P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(With a look of pure <B>hate</B>, glares, through clenched teeth:)</I> Call it a sudden <I>"revelation"</I>. You called me at <I>11:30 p.m.</I> the night my parents were killed. The NTSB reported that the plane went off of their radar at <I>11:25 p.m.</I> Eastern Daylight Time, and it wasn't until <I>12:15 a.m.</I> that the <I>first</I> reports came in that the plane had crashed. <I>(Begins to grow furious, frowns deeply:) How</I> could you have known JUST <I>FIVE</I> MINUTES AFTER THAT THE PLANE HAD CRASHED, UNCLE WILL?! THE NTSB DIDN'T KNOW FOR SURE UNTIL 12:15 A.M.!</P>


     <P>William simply gave a <I>cool</I> look at Darren, then broke out in a <I>slow</I> grin.</P>


<P>WILLIAM: <I>(Smug, playful tone:) Ooops--silly me</I>--I guess I should've waited a bit <I>longer</I> to call and tell you the news. Well, you know, Darren, that's a <I>good</I> question, and there's a good <I>explanation</I> for it--<I>(chuckles:)</I> you see--</P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Cuts him off, enraged beyond words:)</I> --YOU THINK THIS IS SOME SORT OF A DAMN <I>JOKE</I>, UNCLE WILL?! YOU <I>BASTARD</I>! YOU KILLED MY PARENTS! YOU KILLED YOUR <I>OWN</I> BROTHER, AND MY MOTHER! I'M GOING TO--<I>(starts to rush towards William)</I></P>


     <P>At the next instant, Benny, Ernie, a soaking-wet Oscar, and Bert stepped into the spotlight with their guns <I>drawn</I> and pointed in a circle <I>at</I> Darren, who stopped when he saw them. William simply kept his composure, then suddenly gave Darren a <I>very</I> deep scowl, and spoke.</P>


<P>WILLIAM: <I>(In a cold, low, dangerous tone:)</I> Let's get something <I>straight</I> from the get-go, <I>"nephew"</I>--all of the damn <I>"kung-fu"</I> in the <I>world</I> won't save you from a <I>bullet</I>. I'd </I>strongly</I> suggest that you <I>remember</I> that. Now, sit down in the chair.</P>


     <P>Darren looked around at the guns, then back at his uncle, glaring, and not moving.</P>


<P>WILLIAM: <I>(In a more forceful tone:)</I> I-said-<I>SIT</I>-down. <I>(Darren then moves slowly to the chair, and lowers himself unto it, all the while glaring at William)</I> Good. Benny, grab the <I>rope</I> and tie him up good and tight. <I>(Benny vanishes into the darkness while the others keep their guns pointed at Darren, then comes back and starts to tie Darren's arms and legs to the chair with the rope)</I></P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(While Benny does the tying:) Benny Lodell</I>--why aren't I <I>surprised</I>? Want to give me a <I>reason</I> why you <I>hate</I> me so much?</P>

<P>BENNY: <I>(Smirks, sneers:)</I> Sure--why the <I>hell</I> not? I worked my <I>ass</I> off in the <I>salt mines</I> of the mailrooms and offices, while you ate <I>cavier</I>, took <I>sailing</I> jaunts and <I>hobnobbed</I> with your <I>rich</I> friends living a <I>lie</I>, though I didn't know it until last year. <I>Mr.</I> Appleton here had taken me under his <I>wing</I>, and gave me a <I>chance</I> to become <I>important</I>. When he found out what had transpired at that resort in the Keys, it <I>changed</I> him--made him more <I>focused</I>--and <I>determined. (Pulls the rope deliberately tighter on Darren's arm, makes Darren flinch in pain:)</I> Oh, did I make you feel <I>uncomfortable</I>? I'm <I>so</I> sorry.</P>


     <P>After about a minute, Benny finished up and backed away from Darren, giving him a <I>contemptable</I> look, and Darren more than giving him one back in kind. William then came up to Darren.</P>


<P>WILLIAM: <I>(In his cold, calm voice:)</I> Now, as I was saying before I was so <I>rudely</I> interrupted, there's a <I>good</I> explanation for it--you see, I hired Sanchez to install a <I>very</I> small device within the <I>inside</I> of the fuel valve that was <I>set</I> to go off at a <I>specified</I> time. I found out from your <I>"father"</I> that he and your <I>"mother"</I> were going to use that plane a day after it had been serviced at Los Angeles International, then to LaGuardia, then flown to the local airport near the mansion. <I>(Darren looks apalled as William continues)</I> The device is something of <I>my</I> creation, while <I>secretly</I> using our <I>Technology Division's</I> technological know how. The device was about a little smaller than the radius of a <I>dime</I>, and just a <I>tad</I> thicker than one. It had a tiny <I>timer</I> on it, and get this--<I>(grins sinisterly:)</I> a tiny <I>sac</I> of some <I>very special corrosive acid</I> contained within it, too. The acid was <I>released</I> on the fuel valve that was connected to the fuel pump when the time expired, creating a hole <I>juuust</I> big enough to allow the fuel to escape <i>damn</i>, it's <i>scary</i> how far we've come in <i>creating</i> things this <i>advanced</i>, isn't it? <i>(Darren simply looks at him, silent)</i> I'll admit it was <I>touch-and-go</I> there for awhile, <I>"nephew"</I>, not knowing if your <I>"parents"</I> would go at the last second, or such, but fortunately, they <I>did. (Darren now looks at his uncle hard, stunned at his reserved nature while casually explaining. William continues:)</I> Do you realize it took a good <I>six</I> months to get such a device worked out to my <I>specifications</I>? Benny and I pulled some <I>long</I> hours in designing it just right, <I>(Benny smirks wickedly)</I> but in the end, we hit the <I>jackpot</I>.</P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Looks at his uncle sadly, shakes his head slowly in disbelief, weak, shaky voice:)</I> W-why, Uncle Will, <I>why</I>?</P>


     <P>William gave Darren an <I>incredulous</I> look, as if his <I>"nephew"</I> had lost his <I>mind</I>.</P>


<P>WILLIAM: You're <I>kidding</I>, right? Tell me you're <I>kidding</I>?</P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Suddenly red-faced, strains to get out of his ropes at William, screams:)</I> DO I <I>LOOK</I> LIKE I'M KIDDING, UNCLE WILL?! WHY DID YOU DO IT?!</P>

<P>WILLIAM: <I>(Narrows his eyes, cold voice:)</I> Why do you <I>think, "nephew"</I>?! For the <I>power</I>, my boy, for the power! <I>(Adds in a nonchalant manner, looks at the back of his hand cooly:)</I> I wouldn't just kill your <I>"father"</I> and <I>"mother"</I> for <I>nothing</I>, you know--I <I>had</I> to have a <I>reason</I>.</P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Tries to calm himself:)</I> L-let me see if I <I>understand</I> this correctly--y-you killed my parents just so you could <I>take over</I> the conglomerate? B-but--</P>

<P>WILLIAM: --<I>You</I> were chosen to head the conglomerate <I>instead</I>? <I>(Frowns:)</I> Yes, I know--of course, at the time, I <I>didn't</I> know that they had chosen <I>you</I>--what <I>idiots. (Darren glares at William with daggers) Why</I> did you think I was so <I>upset</I> at the reading of the business will when your <I>"da-da"</I> choose <I>you</I>? I <I>assumed</I> that <I>I</I> would take over after he and his wife died--I couldn't just kill Arthur Sr. <I>alone</I>, you see--I also had to kill <I>Lucille</I> to <I>ensure</I> that I could take over--no need for <I>her</I> to step into his shoes after he died. Imagine my <I>surprise</I> and <I>anger</I> when your parents chose <I>you</I> to become Chairman. <I>(Snorts:)</I> I guess my brother and sister-in-law had the last <I>laugh</I> on me, eh? Anyway, I immediately began of thinking of <I>new</I> ways to <I>eliminate</I> you down the road when you <I>shocked</I> me, my boy. You chose <I>me</I> to head the conglomerate--quite the <I>ironic</I> thing, don't you think? Choosing your <I>"parents" killer</I> to take over in their stead? I couldn't <I>believe</I> my good luck. You should be <I>grateful</I>, Darren--when you chose <I>me</I>, you <I>extended</I> your <I>life</I>. In fact, if you had simply turned over <I>everything</I> to me then and there on a <I>permanent</I> basis, I had actually <I>seriously</I> considered in letting you <I>live</I> out of <I>gratitude</I> for your <I>"seeing the light"</I> in letting me take over--<I>(frowns:) "letting"</I> me, mind you, as if I was some sort of <I>damn temporary caretaker</I> after all the years and <I>hard</I> work I put into this company, but <I>noooo</I>--you had to get <I>nosy</I>, and hire <I>Woo</I> to do some <I>snooping</I> behind the crash after he had found your <I>real</I> family. <I>(Pauses, considers:)</I> I should have recommended someone a little more <I>incompetent</I> to assist you in finding your birth parents, Darren, but, oh well--<I>"hindsight is 20-20"</I>, and such--</P> 

<P>DARREN: <I>(Shakes with fury, clenched teeth, looks down:)</I> I can't believe I was such a <I>fool--(Benny mouths, "That you were")</I> I knew you were <I>ambitious</I>, Uncle Will, even <I>harsh</I> in business, but-but, <I>this</I>--?</P>

<P>WILLIAM: <I>(Draws his face close to Darren's, narrows eyes:)</I> Actually, there's a <I>deeper</I> reason as to why I did all of this, <I>"nephew"</I>. Do you want to know? <I>(Adds:)</I> I mean, <I>really</I> want to know?</P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(After a pause, glares:)</I> For <I>some</I> reason, <I>no</I> I don't, but I think you'll tell me <I>anyway</I>, so <I>knock</I> yourself out.</P>


     <P>William gave a sharp laugh out loud.</P>


<P>WILLIAM: <I>That's</I> the <I>spirit</I>, my boy--give me some of that <I>fire</I>! All right, here goes--you remember when I told you about the <I>stockholder's meeting</I> in the Florida Keys last year at the mansion, you know, the part about when I told you that your <I>"father"</I> told me about your being <I>adopted</I>? Well, I <I>lied. (Darren says nothing, narrows eyes)</I> I <I>overheard</I> your <I>"ma-ma"</I> tell Millie that you were adopted on the beach one night while we were there. I think you were actually gone with your <I>"father"</I> and <I>Stephanie</I> to attend some <I>party</I>, or something, I can't remember. Well, anyway, I was just walking on the beach alone after I had spent some time with a female, er, <I>"colleague"</I>, when I happened to stumble upon dear Lucille's <I>"confession"</I> near some palm trees. I hid behind a nearby sand dune while she talked. <I>(Sneers while Benny chuckles:)</I> The poor dear was <I>devastated</I>, I can tell you that. Lucille talked to Millie about <I>how</I> you came to be adopted while she and Arthur Sr. were out for that <I>glorious</I> year they put <I>me</I> in charge, and about the <I>Barnes Adoption Agency</I>. Well, you can imagine how <I>stunned</I> I was when I heard it, then I started to become <I>angry</I> over the <I>lie</I> your parents had given us after all of these years. <I>(Pauses:)</I> In a way, it made a certain amount of <I>sense</I> when I thought about it. <I>(Darren looks at William, baffled)</I> I mean, I always thought you were a little out of <I>place</I> as I observed you growing up, Darren--and not just from the fact that you didn't <I>look</I> like your <I>"parents"</I>, oh no. You seemed--<I>(searches for words:)</I> oh, like you didn't have that certain <I>confident</I> air about yourself as an Appleton, as if you were little <I>unsure</I> of yourself for some reason, as if you felt you didn't <I>belong</I>--and that made me <I>resent</I> you somehow--that and the fact that you were the <I>heir</I> to the fortune and the conglomerate. I seriously thought about <I>blackmailing</I> your <I>"parents"</I> by <I>demanding</I> the chairmanship from Arthur Sr., even <I>investigating</I> myself on how you came about to be adopted, but I didn't want to take a <I>chance</I> on being <I>exposed</I>--I figured <I>you'd</I> give me the lowdown on how you were <I>cursed</I> into coming into our family--oh, and the fact that your <I>"daddy"</I> and <I>"mommy"</I> were considered such <I>"saints"</I> by every DAMN one, I was afraid that the Board and the stockholders would <I>sympathize</I> with <I>them</I>, and make <I>me</I> the <I>bad</I> guy for exposing their secret--which I guess I <I>am</I> now, <I>(frowns, bitter tone:)</I> as I've <I>always</I> been in my life--God only <i>knows</i> what I did to <i>please</i> your <i>"so-called"</i> grandfather, but in <i>his</i> eyes, Arthur Sr. could do <i>no</i> wrong while we were growing up. Don't tell me you didn't <i>feel</i> like an <i>outsider</i> at times--in fact you <i>told</i> me <i>yourself</i> a very long time ago when you were about <i>seven</i> years old. I'm sure you <i>don't</i> remember--</p>


     <p>Darren looked away, shocked, and wide-eyed, then spoke in a <i>whisper</i>.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Cuts him off:)</i> --I <i>do</i> remember, Uncle Will--I remember an <i>argument</i> my parents had one night in the study--it was a <i>terrible</i> one about <i>me</i>, that's how I could still remember it. <i>(Frowns, ponders:)</i> My mother seemed about to say something concerning <i>me</i> to my father when I came into the study to ask what was going on--I was--<i>crying</i> because they were doing so, and I blamed <i>myself</i> for some reason. They stopped arguing immediately, and my mother <i>hugged</i> me, telling me that she and my dad's argument had <i>nothing</i> to do with me--I <i>didn't</i> quite believe her, though.</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Faux sympathy, sneers:) Awww</i>--how <i>touching</i>--did <i>"mommy"</i> make the <i>"pain"</i> go away? <i>(Snickers come from everyone but William, while Darren glares at Benny)</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Now smirks, faux admonishment:)</i> Now, now Benny--my poor, poor <i>"nephew's"</i> in enough <i>"hot water"</i> as it is--no need to <i>rub</i> it in. (Ahem) I remember you coming to me the very next day when your <i>"father"</i> had some business to conduct at the office, Darren, and he took you along like he <i>usually</i> did at times on the job. You told me of your <i>confusion</i> about the argument, and I really tried to be the <i>"caring"</i> uncle--I went to Arthur Sr., and he <i>assured</i> me that nothing was <i>amiss--(pauses:)</i> obviously, the <i>bastard</i> lied to me, <i>(Darren scowls)</i> just as <i>Lucille</i> did, and to everyone <i>else</i> after all of these years. <i>(Looks at Darren stoically:)</i> Your entire <i>existence</i> as an Appleton was a <i>lie</i>, Darren.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Wide-eyed, stunned beyond belief:)</i> How can you <i>say</i> that, Uncle Will? I was <i>raised</i> as an Appleton! I <i>feel</i>--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Cuts him off, gets in Darren's face:)</i> --DON'T TELL ME ABOUT WHAT YOU "FEEL", BOY! <i>(Pauses, tries to put his anger under control:)</i> How-<i>DARE</i>-you say that you're an Appleton? You weren't <i>born</i> as one! You don't have the <i>blood</i>! You were <i>conceived</i> by a <i>career-driven</i> lawyer who has always put her job <i>ahead</i> of her family, and an <i>idiotic</i> career-driven father who was called a <i>"sissy-wimp"</i> by his <i>domineering</i> military daddy, and sent off to military school because of it! <i>(Darren grits his teeth in hidden fury at his uncle)</i> Face it, <i>"nephew" (leans over almost face-to-face to Darren, emphasizes each word:) --you-were-<B>never</B>-an-Appleton</i>!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shouts:)</i> THAT'S NOT TRUE, UNCLE WILL! I <i>AM</i> AN APPLETON! THE <i>TAPE--(stops himself)</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: Oh <i>yes</i>--that <i>tape</i> you have--the one where your <i>"parents"</i> told you the <i>truth</i> about your being adopted? <i>(Darren looks at William, surprised)</i> In case you're wondering how I found out about it, <i>Millie</i> told me about it. <i>(Pauses:) Where</i> is it by the way?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks down and away, sneers:)</i> Gee, I don't know--did you check the planet <i>Pluto</i>, Uncle? <i>(Benny takes a step towards Darren, who looks at Benny with contempt, but William immediately motions for Benny to stop, which he does)</i> I don't give a <i>damn</i> about what you think, Uncle--I <i>am</i> an Appleton.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Grins, cool tone:)</i> So you <i>say</i>, Darren, so you say--let's just <i>forget</i> about the tape. Now, if's that's <i>true</i> about your being an "Appleton", then why hadn't you <i>told</i> your birth family of <i>who</i> you really are, <i>before</i> Woo told you of what he found out about Sanchez, eh? You had <i>ample</i> opportunities to do so--maybe you were starting to feel <i>attached</i> to your birth family, you know, getting a feeling of <i>familiarity</i>, of <i>belonging</i> with them instead of with <i>us</i>? Maybe you were thinking of how they'd <i>react</i> to you when they found out your <i>wealth</i>, and how <i>differently</i> they'd think of you, dear boy? I took that into <i>consideration</i> when I <i>filled</i> your head on the notion that the <i>Morgendwillers</i> might do just that when they found out who you were. <i>(Benny and the other captors of Darren think about <b>correcting</b> William, but chose <b>not</b> to do so out of <b>fear</b>)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Through clenched teeth:) Shut up</i>, Uncle Will--that's <i>enough</i>--in fact, I think I'm <i>more</i> of an Appleton than <i>you</i> are, because a <i>"true"</i> Appleton would've <i>never</i> done what you did! <i>(Pauses, realizes, while William scowls at him cooly:)</i> You wanted me <i>out</i> of the way trying to find the Morgendorffers to <i>consolidate</i> your <i>power</i>, didn't you? That's why you transferred <i>Leonard</i> and <i>Constance</i>, isn't it?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Sighs:)</i> Never let it be said that you can't see the <i>obvious</i>, Darren--<i>of course</i> I did that! <i>(Pauses:)</i> But now when I think about it, I'm not <i>finished</i> with those two yet.</p>

<p>DARREN: <I>(Narrows his eyes:)</I> What do you <I>mean</I>, Uncle Will?</P> 

<P>WILLIAM: Here's what I mean, dear boy--I intend to <I>kill</I> Leonard and Constance <I>later</I> on down the road--probably like <I>you</I> when we take your <I>dead</I> body, and cause an <I>"accident"</I>. They had the <I>audacity</I> to <I>challenge</I> me--and believe you me, I <I>never</I> forget a <I>challenge</I> to <I>my</I> authority. <I>(Looks off into space, glares:)</I> It may take a <I>year</I> or <I>two</I>, but they'll get <I>their's</I>.</P>


   <P>Darren looked at William, <I>horrified</I>--his uncle was <I>two bricks short of a load</I>. It became all too clear to Darren that this man would <I>destroy</I> anyone and anything that would get his way.</P>


<P>DARREN: You said you were going to <I>kill</I> me, Uncle Will--why then did you <I>kidnap</I> the Morgendorffers and Sandi Griffin? They have <I>nothing</I> to do with <I>any</I> of this! <I>I'm</I> the one that you want! Leave them <I>out</I> of it!</P>

<P>WILLIAM: <I>(Shrugs, faux concern:)</I> I <I>tried</I>, Darren, I <I>really</I> tried, but there was no <I>legal</I> way to get you to turn over the <I>entire</I> conglomerate otherwise--<I>you</I> left me with no <I>other</I> choice. Potter did such a <I>damn</I> fine job with the paperwork--yet <I>another</I> reason why he's got to taken <I>care</I> of--that I <I>had</I> to resort to this!</P>

<P>DARREN: You could have just gotten to <I>me</I> instead of dragging them into this! <I>(Pauses, realizes:)</I> And what about <I>aunt Millie</I>? <I>How</I> are you going to <I>explain</I> my death to her?</P>

<P>WILLIAM: Ah, but then, I had to make <I>sure</I> you'd <I>cooperate</I> with me, Darren. I had to ensure that you'd do what I told you <I>exactly</I> to keep your birth family alive--and as for Millie, don't you <I>worry</I> about her--<I>I'll</I> be there to <I>console</I> her in her grief.</P>

<P>DARREN: You <I>bastard--now</I> I see--you want me to sign over <I>everything</I> to you so you can show the <I>Board</I> and the <I>shareholders</I> my <I>"approval"</I> for you to take over the company!</P>

<P>WILLIAM: <I>(Smiles:)</I> --And to keep your birth family and girlfriend <I>alive</I>, don't forget that.</P>


     <P>Darren sighed, then looked pointedly at his uncle.</P>


<P>DARREN: I'll <I>sign</I>--but only when the Morgendorffers and Sandi Griffin are released <I>first</I>.</P>

<P>WILLIAM: <I>(Raised eyebrows:)</I> Why, Darren, don't you <I>trust</I> me, dear boy?</P>


     <P>Darren gave his uncle the <I>same</I> incredulous look that William gave him after Darren had asked why William had killed Darren's parents. <I>Turnabout was fair play.</I></P>


<P>DARREN: <I>(Sneers:) "You're <B>kidding</B>, right? Tell me you're <B>kidding</B>?"</I></P>


<P>WILLIAM: <I>(Laughs now:) Very good</I>, Darren--very good, indeed! I suppose you got me there! <I>(Suddenly grows serious:)</I> Of course, you're going to <I>have</I> to trust me--you have <I>no</I> choice, <I>"nephew".</I></P>


     <P>Darren bit his lower lip, rapidly moving his eyes around, thinking of something, anything--he needed to buy some <I>time</I>, somehow. He hoped against hope that someone would figure out that his birth family and Sandi Griffin were <I>missing--right, and <B>Batman</B> would come in and make <B>short</B> work of his uncle and his goons</I>. He found the will to <I>chuckle</I> to himself over that thought despite the situation--his sister's and Jane's <I>sarcasm</I> was rubbing off on <I>him</I>--a least a <I>little</I>, anyway.</P>


<P>DARREN: <I>(Sighs:) All right</I>, Uncle Will, I'll <I>sign. (William and Benny smirk wickedly:)</I> But I want to <I>examine</I> the document <I>thoroughly</I> myself--think of it as a <I>"last request"</I> on my part.</P>

<P>WILLIAM: Fair enough. <I>(Turns toward the spotlight, looks up:) Norwood</I>! Get out from behind that <I>spotlight beam projector</I> and get down here with that file!</P>


     <P>Darren heard some grunts in the dark, like someone climbing down a <I>ladder</I>, a quick shuffle of some papers, then hurried footsteps that grew louder. <I>Sam Norwood</I> timidly came out of the darkness holding a file about 30 seconds later, coming up beside William, gasping.</P>


<P>DARREN: <I>(Sardonic, rolls eyes:) More</I> surprises--quite a <I>leap</I> from representing Mafia figures to <I>murder</I>--hmm--now when I <I>think</I> of it, it's more of a <I>short hop</I> than a leap.</P>

<P>NORWOOD: <I>(Offended:) H-hey</I>! I'm <I>not</I> the one wanting to <I>kill</I> you, Mr. Appleton!</P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Cocks an eyebrow:) Oh</I>, so it's <I>"Mr. Appleton"</I> now, is it? I should be <I>flattered</I>, I guess-- <I>(pauses, scowls:)</I> as if <I>that's</I> going to <I>clear</I> your <I>conscience</I>? <I>(Smirks:)</I> Take a good <I>look</I> around, Mr. Norwood--you're about to actually <I>join</I> some <I>murderers</I>, and not just by <I>representing</I> them anymore.</P> 

<P>NORWOOD: <I>(Frowns:) S-shut up</I>!</P>

<P>WILLIAM: <I>(Rolls his eyes:) Enough</I>! Norwood, show my <I>"nephew"</I> the document, and let's get this <I>over</I> with!</P>

<P>NORWOOD: Y-yessir, Boss. <I>(Pulls out the document from the file)</I></P> 



<P><I>(Scene changes to Woo's car, the same time)</I></P>



     <P>Woo was finishing his story about Darren, and Daria and Jane were <I>beyond</I> flabbergasted. All of this on <I>top</I> of what happened to Darren, made Daria look at her brother with a <I>newfound</I> appreciation, Jane, the same. This story had all of the elements of a <I>Greek tragedy</I>, with some <I>Shakespeare</I> thrown in for good measure. Daria then spoke with a certain <I>clarity</I> in her voice.</P>


<P>DARIA: Darren was trying to <I>protect</I> us? He took all of this <I>crap</I> and then some because of some <I>bastard</I> or <I>bastards</I> who killed his adopted parents, making it <I>look</I> like an accident, and they're now going to try and kill <I>my</I> family? <I>(Frowns:)</I> I'll be <I>damned</I> if I let that happen--I'll <I>admit</I> they get on my <I>nerves</I> sometimes, but they're my <I>family--(adds:)</I> even <I>Quinn</I>.</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Same frown:)</I> You and me both, amiga. Damn it, Woo, who do you think it is?</P>

<P>WOO: I'm only <I>guessing</I>, but I believe that Darren's uncle <I>William Appleton</I> is behind this, or a <I>part</I> of some larger group of people who want to take over the company. I checked to see if he was going to be at work today, but his secretary told me he was out, something that had <I>rarely</I> occured until this weekend. He left a day <I>after</I> Sanchez was killed, which evens adds <I>more</I> to my suspicions.</P>

<P>DARIA: Wait a minute--<I>the</I> William Appleton--the guy who's running the <I>Appleton Conglomerate</I>? Why in the <I>hell</I> would he want to do <I>this</I> crap? Isn't he in <I>charge</I> now?</P>

<P>WOO: Yes, but your brother only put him in <I>temporary</I> control--I'm not sure, but William Appleton may be using your family's kidnapping to somehow make sure that his stay is <I>permanent</I>, Daria, though I can't see <I>how</I> he could pull it off.</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Slumps back in her seat, low voice, looks down:)</I> Darren and your family, Daria--<I>oh, geez</I>--do you think we can get there in time? <I>(Puts her hand on her forehead, Daria, sitting beside her, reluctantly puts her hand on Jane's shoulder)</I></P>

<P>DARIA: It'll be like the <I>cavalry</I>, Jane--we'll <I>ride</I> in and kick some <I>ass</I>.</P>

<P>WOO: <I>(Frowns:)</I> No, I <I>don't</I> think you or Jane will, Daria--this isn't a <I>movie</I>--it's quite <I>real</I>. Me and my men have <I>enough</I> things to worry about in your family, this "Sandi Griffin", and your brother. You are <I>not</I> to come in with us, do you <I>understand</I>? You're only here because we needed you to <I>find</I> the place, and that's all!</P>

<P>DARIA: But--</P>

<P>WOO: <I>(Cuts her off sharply:) --NO</I> "but's", Daria! Let us <I>professionals</I> do our jobs!</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Sits back with her arms crossed, frowns:)</I> Like you did when you <I>allowed</I> that "Sanchez" guy who could've been able to point to the <I>S.O.B.</I> who hired him to kill Darren's adopted parents to <I>die</I>? <I>(Daria looks at Jane as if to say, "Oh, hell, Lane--even <B>I</B> wouldn't have said that")</I></P>


     <P>Woo gave a cool <I>glare</I> at Jane, who was now looking out through the window which she had just rolled down to get some air, closing her eyes in pain away from the others (the rain had let up for the moment just enough for her to do so). Daria looked at her quietly, then at Woo out of the corner of her eye, while Leroy and David, who had been silent all of this time, looked at each other uncomfortably. The car pulled up at an intersection, stopping at an traffic light.</P>

     <P>The van carrying <I>Mystik Spiral</I>, better known as the <I>"Tank"</I>, drove along the now dark road. Nick was at the wheel, with Trent riding shotgun, and Jesse and Max in the back. All were <I>not</I> in the best of moods, particularly Trent.</P>


<P>TRENT: <I>(Frowns:)</I> First, the new drum gets <I>busted</I> and we have to go to Leeville to get a replacement, which was to <I>supposedly</I> make us an hour <I>late</I> for our gig at <I>McGrundy's</I>, then we get <I>stuck</I> in the damn <I>mud</I> on our way back because of this rainstorm, which put us so <I>far</I> behind, we had to <I>cancel</I> our gig for tonight! This <I>bites</I>, man!</P>

<P>JESSE: Hey, man--at least we were able to call <I>McGrundy's</I>, and <I>explain</I>. They said that <I>most</I> of the people weren't gonna make there <I>anyway</I> because of the rain washing out some of the roads, so <I>chill</I>. We can come back <I>tomorrow</I> night.</P>

<P>TRENT: <I>(Swivels around in his seat, scowls:)</I> Hey, Jess--remember the <I>rumor</I> about a <I>record agent</I> being there, man? We might've <I>blown</I> it because we couldn't make it back, and he couldn't <I>see</I> us? You gotta take into account that those guys are <I>busy</I> all of the time--this could've been our <I>only</I> chance!</P>

<P>MAX: Don't worry, Trent, we're <I>criminales</I>! We've got the </I>reputation</I>! There are <I>other</I> agents, dude!</P>

<P>TRENT: <I>(Swivels back, mumbles:)</I> Yeah, yeah--<I>(sees a car quickly go by, eyes light up:)</I> hey, am I <I>seeing</I> things, or was that <I>Janey</I> I just saw with some <I>strange</I> guys in a car?</P>

<P>NICK: <I>(Shrugs, in a nonchalant tone:)</I> Wouldn't be the <I>first</I> time, man. <I>(Trent <B>frowns</B> at Nick)</I> Hey, man--I didn't mean it like <I>that</I>, okay?</P>

<P>TRENT: <I>(Narrows his eyes:)</I> That <I>was</I> Janey--<I>follow</I> them, Nick.</P>

<P>NICK: <I>(Surprised with the others:)</I> Huh? Why--</P>


     <P>Trent gave Nick the glare that said, <I>"Don't screw with me, man".</I> Though he wasn't a <I>fighter</I>, Trent was a <I>leader</I>, and he could <I>communicate</I> what he wanted by just showing the right <I>bodily motions</I> to the group. Nick and the others knew he was <I>serious</I>--to Trent, Jane was <I>his</I> responsibilty, and no one else's, not until she was <I>married</I>, at least. To take up an issue over his sister would be <I>dangerous</I> indeed, at least Nick and the others <I>thought</I> so, though they <I>never</I> found out personally, save for <I>Jesse</I> once, when Trent thought he was taking <I>"advantage"</I> of Jane in the <I>Zen</I> a while back, even though Jane <i>herself</i> had said it was just some <i>necking</i>. Jesse <i>never</i> talked about what happened that night to the others, save for the fact that he did not want to <i>"tangle with Trent over Jane like that again, period"</i>.</p>


<p>NICK: Hang on, man, we're on it. <i>(Turns the "Tank" to follow the car)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene is about five minutes later, a little less than a quarter of a mile from the warehouses)</i></p>



     <p>Woo's car pulled up to a clump of trees without the headlights on, and stopped on the muddy road. About this time it had started to rain heavily again, as well as get windy. Woo turned to Daria and Jane to speak while David and Leroy got out of the car and went to the trunk, presumably to get their <i>weapons</i>.</p>


<p>WOO: We don't <i>dare</i> get any closer because there may be <i>lookouts</i>. The rain is a <i>welcome</i> addition, as well as the dark, for both will provide <i>cover</i> to us while we make our way there.</p>

<p>JANE: Why in the hell can't we go with you a <i>little</i> ways at least? Daria and I wouldn't be any <i>trouble. (Thought v.o.: I never thought I'd <b>ever</b> say anything like that.)</i></p>

<p>WOO: Jane, <i>please</i>--we've talked about this. It's <i>too</i> dangerous. I can't <i>guarantee</i> your safety.</p>

<p>JANE: So when did we pay any damn <i>money</i> for a <i>warranty</i>? We can take care of ourselves, Woo!</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Scowls now:)</i> I'm <i>not</i> going to <i>argue</i> the point, Jane--I want you and Daria to <i>promise</i> me that you two <i>won't</i> follow me and my men! You've <i>fulfilled</i> your <i>duty</i> by getting us here--now, let us do our jobs!</p>

<p>JANE: But--</p>

<p>WOO: --PROMISE ME!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sighs:)</i> We--<i>promise</i>, Woo. <i>(Jane scowls at Daria)</i> Jane and I <i>won't</i> follow you.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Satisfied:)</i> Good. <i>(Tone grows lower:)</i> Look, I'm really sorry about this, but I just don't want to see either of you get <i>hurt</i>, or possibly get even <i>killed</i>. I've failed Darren <i>once</i> before--I don't want to do so again. I <i>promise</i> to try and get your family, Sandi Griffin, and Darren out. <i>(Pauses:)</i> If we don't come back in <i>30 minutes</i>, take the car, and call the <i>police</i>.</p> 


     <p>Woo got out of the car and went to meet David and Leroy in the rain. Both girls saw Woo reach into his jacket and pull out a <i>huge</i> gun, checking it for ammo. Jane glanced at the gun and spoke to Daria.</p>


<p>JANE: Woo's got a <i>44 Magnum. (David and Leroy pull out their guns and check for ammo as well:)</i> Those guys have <i>Glocks--(Daria looks at Jane, intrigued)</i> that's some <i>serious</i> damn firepower they have, amiga.</p>

<p>DARIA: You know your <i>guns</i>--are you in the <i>N.R.A.</i> or something?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Shrugs:) Nope</i>--but I have read some gun <i>magazines. (Smirks:)</i> There's so much <i>potential</i> for <i>bloody violence</i>, I just can't <i>resist</i>! It's a <i>great</i> subject for a <i>nihilist</i> painting! I'll call it <i>"The Guns of Nihilone--Existence is Useless!"</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan, smirks:)</i> You have such a <i>positive</i> outlook on life, my friend.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks back:)</i> Hey, <i>you're</i> one to <i>talk</i>, amiga. <i>(Daria gives her Mona Lisa smile)</i></p>


     <p>Daria and Jane watched the men go into the now-dark windy and rainy night.</p>


<p>JANE: Okay, they're <i>gone</i>, Daria--let's get the <i>hell</i> out and <i>follow</i> them--<i>(starts to open the door)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Hesitates:) --No</i>, Jane.</p>

<p>JANE: Yeah, and we'll--<i>(pauses:) huh</i>? I'm sorry, I didn't quite <i>hear</i> you right--did you just say <i>no</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: Yeah, I said <i>no</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: Hey, where did all of <i>this</i> come from? A few minutes ago, we were the <i>cavalry</i>, now suddenly, it's <i>"no"</i>? Daria, your <i>family</i>, and Darren being a <i>part</i> of it, mind you--is <i>in</i> there--<i>(adds as an afterthought:)</i> oh, and <i>Sandi</i> is as well! How in the <i>hell</i> can you just <i>sit</i> out here and wait?! We gotta--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Cuts her off:)</i> --Jane, as much as I would like to <i>charge</i> in there and beat the <i>hell</i> out of the bastards who have my family--<i>(adds as an afterthought as well:)</i> and <i>Sandi--(sighs:)</i> we <i>can't</i>. I've been condsidering what Woo said, and he's <i>right</i>--the <i>bad</i> guys probably have <i>guns</i>--Woo and his men have guns--we <i>don't</i> have guns--not that I'd ever <i>carry</i> one, mind you. We'd only be in the <i>way</i>, and could get ourselves <i>killed</i> in the process.</p>


     <p>Jane looked at Daria, shocked, then frowned.</p>


<p>JANE: I <i>never</i> thought that Daria Morgendorffer would <i>ever</i> be <i>scared</i> of anything! You've <i>always</i> stood up for what you <i>believed</i> in! Don't you <i>believe</i> we need to <i>save</i> your family--and <i>Sandi</i>?!</p>

<p>DARIA: Of course I do, Jane--but I believe in standing up for my <i>principles</i>, not in standing up and <i>charging</i> in there and possibly getting a family member or myself <i>killed</i>. I'm not a <i>violent</i> person by <i>nature</i>, Jane--I only use sarcasm as means to put people in their <i>place</i>, and call things as I see them.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Opens the door, shakes her head slowly:)</i> You're telling me things I <i>already</i> know, amiga--and I'm going to call something as <i>I</i> see it--you're a <i>coward</i>, Daria! <i>(Daria looks stunned) I'm</i> going in there to help save Darren and his family--and <i>Sandi</i>! You can stay in this car and <i>cower</i>, but not me!</p>

<p>DARIA: Jane, wait--</p>

     <p>Jane got out in the rain, and started to walk in the direction where Woo and his men went. Daria stared at Jane for a moment, then mouthed <i>"Ah, hell"</i>, and got out of the car, too. She jogged a little to catch up to Jane, who had stopped when she saw Daria.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Shouting over the rain, grins:)</i> I figured that would <i>shake</i> you to get off of your <i>ass</i>!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Ditto:)</i> Oh I'm <i>shaking</i>, all right--shaking in my damn <i>boots</i>! I guess if I'm gonna <i>die</i>, it might as well be in a blaze of <i>glory</i>! <i>(Starts to leave with Jane)</i></p>


     <p>Both stopped when they saw headlights coming towards them in the road. For a moment, the headlights appeared that they were <i>not</i> going to stop, but they did. The headlights shut off, and <i>Trent</i> got out with the others. He rushed up to a shocked Jane and <i>hugged</i> her.</p>


<p>TRENT: <i>Janey</i>, it <i>was</i> you! I <i>knew</i> it! <i>(Sees Daria:)</i> Hey, Daria--we thought we had <i>lost</i> you guys a ways back!</p>

<p>DARIA: Hey Trent! Fancy meeting you out here in the <i>"Great Outdoors"</i>! <i>(Sees the rest of the band:)</i> Welcome to the <i>abyss</i>, gentleman--leave your <i>sanity</i> at the door--I know I <i>just</i> have! <i>(Jesse and the others look at each other, confused)</i></p>

<p>JANE: Trent, what in the <i>hell</i> are you and the guys doing <i>here</i>?! I thought you'd be at <i>McGrundy's</i> by now! <i>(Pauses, realizes:)</i> Hey, did you say you were <i>following</i> us?!</p>

<p>TRENT: Yeah! Our gig at <i>McGrundy's</i> got cancelled because we couldn't get back from Leeville in time! We saw you go by <i>(points at Woo's car:)</i> in <i>that</i> car with some guys! Why are <i>you</i> guys out here, <i>who</i> are those guys you were with--<i>(looks around:)</i> and where's <i>Darren</i>?! Wasn't he <i>with</i> you two?</p>

<p>JANE: Trent, Daria and I will try to tell you and the guys in <i>bits and pieces</i> on the way to the warehouse district--c'mon, we might not have <i>much</i> time! <i>(Pulls Trent with her as she goes with Daria and the others into the darkness)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the warehouse where Darren and his captors are)</i></p>



    <p>William kept looking at his watch impatiently while Darren was "carefully" looking over the document. Save for the rain outside, there was silence in the dimly lit-to-darkened warehouse. Benny glared at Darren, while Oscar and Ernie were standing around, and talking. Bert had gone to check on Helen, Jake, Quinn, and Sandi.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(In his most deliberately slow tone:)</i> Mr. Norwood, will you explain paragraph four, section three to me <i>again</i>? I want to make absolutely <i>sure</i> I <i>understand</i> it--<i>(adds:)</i> and please, call me <i>Darren</i>.</p>

<p>NORWOOD: <i>(Perfectly in his "element":)</i> Why, <i>certainly</i>, Mr.--er, Darren, you see--</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Cuts him off, takes gun out of his holster, points it at a flinching Darren:)</i> He's <i>stalling</i>, Boss! I think your <i>"nephew's"</i> up to something!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sneers:)</i> How can I be <i>"up to something"</i>, Benny, while I'm all <i>tied</i> up here? You haven't seen anyone <i>else</i> come in here trying to <i>rescue</i> me, have you?</p>

<p>BENNY: Not <i>yet</i>. Boss, can't we <i>check</i> outside?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(After a moment:)</i> I don't see why not--good thinking, Benny--maybe you haven't <i>lost</i> your <i>usefulness</i> to me. <i>(Benny sighs in relief)</i> Take <i>Oscar</i> and check out there. <i>(Oscar gives a slight frown of disapproval from having to stand in the rain previously, but says nothing)</i></p>

<p>BENNY: Right, Boss. <i>(Smirks:)</i> C'mon, <i>"Grouch". (Oscar scowls at him as he takes out his gun as well while they leave out into the dark warehouse and outside)</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: Now, my patience is wearing <i>thin, "nephew"</i>. You've had <i>more</i> than enough time to examine the document--it's time for you to <i>sign</i> it so you can save your girlfriend and family. <i>(Pulls out a pen:)</i> Get it <i>over</i> with, dear boy.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Glares:)</i> And <i>how</i> do I do that, Uncle, with my <i>mouth</i>? You're going to have to <i>untie</i> me, you know.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> Oh, no you don't--I'm no <i>fool</i>, Darren--the <i>moment</i> you get <i>loose</i>, you'll try some <i>fool</i> martial arts <i>stunt</i> to free yourself. Instead, I'll loosen <i>one</i> of your arms so you can sign the document, and since you're <i>right</i>-handed, it'll be that one. Norwood, do the <i>honors</i>, and loosen his arm. <i>(Bert comes out of the dark:)</i> Ah--<i>Bert</i>--take out your <i>gun</i> along with Ernie and <i>point</i> it at Darren to keep him from <i>trying</i> something. <i>(Both do so)</i> How are the <i>Morgendopplers</i> and that <i>"Griffin"</i> girl?</p>

<p>BERT: As well as can be <i>expected</i>, Boss--<i>(adds:)</i> though the Griffin girl and that <i>"Quinn"</i> girl were <i>arguing</i> over who's <i>dress</i> was <i>dirtier</i>, and your <i>"nephew's"</i> birth mother and father were <i>arguing</i> over who was a <i>better</i> parent to their kids. <i>(William looks at Bert strangely, while Darren gives a weak smirk while thinking about both scenes)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Now resumes a serious look to William:)</i> You <i>do</i> realize if you <i>shoot</i> me, you won't get my <i>signiture</i>, and the document will be <i>void</i>.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Ponders:)</i> Yes, I guess that's <i>true</i>--but what if we shoot someone in your <i>family</i>, or something? <i>(Smiles:)</i> You get my <i>"drift"</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>Loud</i> and <i>clear</i>, uncle.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: Spendid--Norwood?</p>


     <p>Norwood began to unravel Darren's right hand as Bert and Ernie pointed their guns at Darren.</p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to outside, the same time)</i></p>



     <p>The rain was getting even <i>heavier</i> as Woo, David, and Leroy made their way towards the warehouses, which were now in sight. All three had split up in a zig-zag pattern, yet keeping each other in sight, all the while constantly looking around for anything out of the ordinary. All three stopped about 300 feet from the warehouses, hiding behind the trees that ringed the inlet. Suddenly, <i>Benny</i> came out from behind one of the warehouses, looking around, his gun cocked. He glanced in the direction of Woo and the others for a moment, then continued to look around. A moment later, Oscar appeared beside him, and both started to move forward to one of the other warehouses. The instant both went out of sight behind it, Woo motioned to Leroy and David to come to him.</p> 


<p>WOO: <i>(Shouts:)</i> There's a <i>fence</i> that's surrounding the site! Either we make our way to the <i>front</i> gate and get through there, or try to find a place and <i>climb</i> it! Suggestions!?</p>

<p>LEROY: Trying to climb it could leave us <i>vunerable</i>, Woo!</p>

<p>DAVID: Going to the front gate could do the <i>same</i> thing, Woo--they could have someone <i>waiting</i> there! I vote we should try and <i>climb</i> the fence in a place! There's no <i>barbed wire</i> on the top of the fence, and it could only take a <i>minute</i> to get over for each one of us! We could keep <i>watch</i> for anybody who might suddenly show up!</p>

<p>LEROY: I <i>agree</i> with David, Woo! It could be a little <i>difficult</i> in this rain to try and climb the fence, but I think it can be done!</p>

<p>WOO: Okay! Let's try it! Once I get over to the other side, I'll move to a the side of one of the warehouses, and watch over you two from there, then Leroy goes next, and David watches him on this side while Leroy climbs over, then Leroy and I can watch for David while David climbs over to the other side, and we can all go to a warehouse! <i>(Both men give curt nods while Woo runs up to a spot, then starts to climb it while David and Leroy act as lookouts)</i></p>


     <p>About 500 feet over to the right, Daria, Jane, and the members of Mystik Spiral came out of the woods towards the warehouses. They did not see Woo and his men, thanks to the combination of the heavy rain, wind, and the darkness. After going behind some bushes, Daria and the others formed a circle and talked loud over the driving wind and rain.</p>


<p>DARIA: Okay, we're here--now <i>how</i> do we get <i>in</i>?!</p>

<p>JANE: We <i>could</i> try climbing the fence in one place!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> Oh, sure--and some <i>goon</i> could come out of one of those warehouses, <i>spot</i> us, and use us for <i>target</i> practice! Without guns, Jane, we'd be <i>sitting ducks</i>!</p>

<p>TRENT: How about trying the <i>front gate</i>? We could come up to it and see if it's open, and get in! If someone's there, we can find <i>another</i> place to climb over, away and behind the warehouses! We might not have any <i>weapons</i>, but we have our <i>wits</i>, man! <i>(Daria's about to say something sarcastic in response, but Jane cuts her off)</i></p>

<p>JANE: Why, bro--that's a <i>splendiferous</i> idea! Let's <i>go</i> for it! <i>(Takes off for the front)</i></p>


     <p>Daria was about to say something, but everyone else had followed Jane before she could. Daria sighed, and shuffled after the others through the heavy rain.</p>

     <p>Woo finally was able to finally get over the fence in the driving rain and wind, and he immediately pulled out his gun and started to go in the direction of the warehouses while Leroy climbed over next. David, still on the outside, had his gun out, and was watching for Leroy. Woo carefully came up against the far right warehouse, and moved against it in a <i>stealthy</i> manner while watching the other two. He took a quick look at the warehouse he was leaning on, looking through the windows. He could not see anything at all
--Darren, his family, and this <i>"Griffin"</i> girl must be in one of the <i>other</i> warehouses.</p> 
     
	<p>As he turned back to David and Leroy, he suddenly heard a <i>shot</i> from around the corner of the warehouse he was beside of being fired, and it was aimed at <i>David</i>, who dove to the ground in a ditch which was beside the fence on the other side. David fired back in that direction. <i>Leroy</i>, who had just jumped from the fence unto Woo's side, pulled out his gun, and quickly made his way over to Woo, who himself was out of the line of fire. The shots had apparently come from around the corner of a warehouse beside the one Woo was at. Woo started to fire his gun around the corner in that direction as well to help cover for Leroy, who joined him. They were now <i>discovered</i>--all <i>hell</i> was about to <i>break</i> loose. Woo looked over at David, and <i>screamed</i> over the rain and wind.</p>


<p>WOO: David, you <i>okay</i>?!</p>

<p>DAVID: Yeah, Woo! Don't worry about <i>me</i>!</p> 

<p>LEROY: Woo, there's <i>nothing</i> we can do for David at the moment. We gotta move as <i>quickly</i> as possible! They could go after the <i>hostages</i>!</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Through clenched teeth:)</i> Yes, you're <i>right</i>--let's go! <i>(Suddenly turns to the locked door of the warehouse:)</i> Let's cut <i>through</i> here!</p>


     <p>Woo <i>shot</i> the lock open, and went into the warehouse, followed closely by Leroy.</p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the front gate, a minute <b>earlier</b>)</i></p>



     <p>Daria and the others had come up to the front gate. Trent tried it, and it came <i>open</i>, while the others had been watching in the direction of the warehouses.</p>


<p>TRENT: <i>All right</i>! Let's go in!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>Carefully</i>, that is!</p>

<p>JANE: Enough <i>gabbing</i>! Time's a wastin'! <i>(Starts to walk forward)</i></p>


     <p>Suddenly, <i>several</i> shots erupted, followed by some <i>shouts</i>, and everyone <i>dived</i> on the ground, looking around, wide-eyed in fear, with their arms over their heads.</p> 


<p>NICK: W-what in the <i>hell</i> was <i>that</i>!? It s-sounded like <i>gunshots</i>!</p>

<p>DARIA: You <i>don't</i> say! What made you come to that <i>sterling</i> conclusion, Nick!?</p>

<p>JESSE: Hey, I don't think they were aimed at <i>us</i>!</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(After a moment:)</i> Jesse's <i>right</i>--those shots seemed to go in the <i>opposite</i> direction! We just <i>heard</i> them!</p>

<p>MAX: M-maybe <i>we</i> should go in the opposite direction <i>too</i>, man
--<i>away</i> from here!</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>No</i> way, Max--we <i>gotta</i> help Daria's family, Darren, and that <i>"Sandi"</i> chick!</p> 

<p>NICK: But what <i>good</i> will we be if don't have anything to <i>defend</i> ourselves, Trent?!</p>

<p>JESSE: Maybe we can <i>find</i> something inside or on the grounds?!</p>

<p>JANE: I <i>agree</i> with Jesse! Let's move out! <i>(Gets up with the others, who are now muddy, and move cautiously towards the warehouses)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the room where Helen, Jake, Quinn and Sandi are, <b>two</b> minutes <b>earlier</b>)</i></p>



     <p>Jake and Helen were struggling to free themselves, though Jake was humming a <i>meaningless</i> tune while doing so. Helen had <i>blocked out</i> his humming in her head, concentrating on getting free instead. Sandi and Quinn were talking about fashion in the meantime, though a <i>now-bored</i> Quinn was about to tell Sandi the <i>unthinkable</i>.</p>


<p>QUINN: --Uh, Sandi--no <i>offense</i>, but I'm kinda <i>tired</i> of talkin' about fashions an' stuff right now, you know?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Shocked, frowns:) Quh--inn</i>! Did I <i>heeear</i> you right?! You're getting <i>tired</i> of the latest <i>gowns</i> and <i>pants</i>, and--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Faux offense, rolls her eyes:) Sannndi</i>! Um--it's not that I'm <i>tired</i> of fashions, I'm just saying that I'm tired of talking <i>about</i> fashions! If we talk about the latest fashions right <i>now</i>, what are we gonna talk about in the <i>future</i> fashion meetings? I'm suggesting that we should <i>save</i> such talk until then--<i>(pauses while Sandi reflects:)</i> I mean, dontcha want <i>Tiffany</i> and <i>Stacy</i> to be in on our talks?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(After a moment:)</i> Very well, Quinn--like, what do you want to talk about?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Cuts in, while struggling:) I</i> have a suggestion, you two--how about instead of <i>talking</i> about something else, why not <i>do</i> something else?</p>

<p>QUINN: What do you mean, Mom? Do <i>what</i>?</p>

<p>HELEN: How about trying to <i>free</i> yourselves from these <i>ropes</i> we're in? Those <i>horrid</i> men <i>say</i> that they're going to free us <i>later</i>, but we don't <i>dare</i> wait until then to find out! They could <i>change</i> their <i>minds</i>, and--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>MUH--OOM</i>! If Sandi and I try to free ourselves, we'll (ugh) rub our wrists <i>raw</i>, and <i>damage</i> our <i>delicate</i> skin! We've already have our (ew) dresses <i>dirty</i>!</p>

<p>SANDI: Well said, Quinn--an' it's <i>sooo</i> unfashionable to do so! Mrs. Morgendorffer, you have to understand--</p>


    <p>The next instant, several <i>shots</i> rang out, <i>scaring</i> everyone, including Jake, who was shaken out of his <i>"little humming world"</i>.</p>


<p>JAKE: <i>(Jumps:)</i> AGH! WHAT IN THE HELL WAS <i>THAT</i>!?</p>

<p>HELEN: OH GOD! <i>GUNSHOTS</i>! <i>(Starts to struggle even harder against the ropes along with Jake:)</i> THEY'RE COMING TO <i>GET</i> US!</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Now panicked:)</i> OHMYGOD! Uhhh--<i>Sandi</i>--?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Suddenly struggles aginst the ropes:)</i> LIKE, QUINN, WHAT'RE YOU <i>WAITING</i> FOR!? LET'S GET FREE!! <i>(Quinn glares back at Sandi for a second, then joins Sandi and the others in trying to get free)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the inside of the middle warehouse, back to Darren and his captors, a minute <b>earlier</b>)</i></p>



     <p>Darren had just finished <i>signing</i> the document. William picked it up and looked at it like it was the most <i>precious</i> thing in the world--and to William it <i>was</i>. Darren glared at him while William did so.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Grins:) Finally</i>--the Appleton Conglomerate, all of it's <i>mine</i>, all mine. This is the <i>greatest</i> day of my life!</p> 

<p>DARREN: Okay, Uncle Will, you have what you want--now I <i>assume</i> you'll <i>keep</i> your word and <i>release</i> the Morgendorffers and Sandi Griffin?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Snaps out of his "trance":)</i> Eh? Oh, <i>yes</i>, I'll <i>release</i> them--into the <i>next world</i>, that is. <i>(Folds up, puts paper into his shirt)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Stunned:) WHAT</i>!?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: I've decided to <i>change</i> my mind. Oscar was <i>right</i>--we can't afford <i>any</i> loose ends. There are too <i>many</i> people <i>involved</i> in this, my boy.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Enraged:)</i> YOU DAMN BASTARD! THEY DID <b>NOTHING</b> TO YOU!</p>


     <p>William stared at Darren stoically, then pulled out his <i>gun</i> and pointed it at <i>Darren</i>, whose eyes grew <i>huge</i>.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: Oh yes they did, <i>"nephew"</i>--they knew <i>you. Goodbye. (Is about to pull the <b>trigger</b>, when shots are fired outside, which makes Darren flinch, then take a deep breath in relief:)</i> What-the-<i>hell</i>? Bert, Ernie, check that out!</p>

<p>BERT: Right, Boss--c'mon, Ernie! <i>(Both he and Ernie leave)</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Ponders:)</i> Best not to take any chances. Darren, it looks like my <i>personal execution</i> of you will have to <i>wait</i> for the time being! Norwood, stay here with my <i>lucky "nephew"</i> while I check that out with Bert and Ernie! <i>(Starts to leave)</i></p>

<p>NORWOOD: B-but Boss--I-I <i>don't</i> have a gun! <i>(Darren narrows his eyes slightly at this)</i></p> 

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Rolls his eyes:)</i> You <i>idiot</i>! He's all <i>tied up</i>, save for his right arm! All you have to do is <i>watch</i> him! <i>(Leaves into the darkness)</i></p>

<p>NORWOOD: O-okay, Boss.</p>


     <p>Darren listened to his uncle's footsteps fade, then he stole a quick glance at Norwood, who was about <i>ten</i> feet from him, then began to <i>whisper</i> something to himself, turning his head <i>away</i> from Norwood. Norwood frowned, perplexed.</p>


<p>NORWOOD: <i>(Narrows his eyes:)</i> Hey, what are you <i>doing</i>?</p>


     <p>Darren ignored him, and continued to whisper to himself with his head turned away from Norwood.</p>


<p>NORWOOD: <i>(Draws closer:)</i> I asked you a <i>question</i>! <i>What</i> are you doing?!</p>


    <p>Darren still whispered to himself. Norwood began to get <i>angry</i>, drawing even <i>more</i> closer.</p>


<p>NORWOOD: DON'T <i>IGNORE</i> ME! I SAID WHAT ARE YOU--</p>


     <p>Before Norwood could <i>react</i>, Darren had used his free arm, and <i>grabbed</i> Norwood around the <i>neck</i>, pulling Norwood to him. Darren whispered in a low, but <i>dangerous</i> tone, while Norwood <i>gasped</i> for air, struggling.</p>


<p>DARREN: Don't <i>shout</i>. Since you were so <i>curious</i>, I was trying to <i>lure</i> you to me, that's <i>what</i> I was doing</i> I'll say this just <i>once</i>--untie me right <i>now</i>, or I'll <i>break</i> your <i>neck</i>, I <i>swear</i> I will. I know certain martial arts <i>holds</i> that will do the <i>trick</i>, and with the way I'm <i>feeling</i> right now, <i>don't</i> think I won't <i>snap</i> it, you <i>got</i> that? <i>Grunt</i> once if you <i>understand</i> me. <i>(Norwood grunts once)</i> Good--now start to <i>loosen</i> the ropes. If you even <i>think</i> about shouting, you're <i>dead. (A terrified Norwood awkwardly reaches down and starts to loosen Darren's ankles while Darren continues to hold Norwood's neck)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Do you know <i>where</i> my family and Sandi Griffin are held?</p>

<p>NORWOOD: <i>(Gasps:)</i> T-they're in the <i>next</i> warehouse <i>over</i>!</p>

<p>DARREN: Good--once you've untied me, we're going over there to <i>free</i> them--<i>hurry up</i>!</p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to outside of the warehouses, where Oscar and Benny are, the same time)</i></p>



     <p>Benny and Oscar were stationed around the corner of a warehouse, watching the fence through the driving rain, with their guns drawn.</p>


<p>BENNY: <i>Hah</i>! I <i>knew</i> I saw something!</p> 

<p>OSCAR: We didn't get that guy who was running across and behind to the <i>next</i> warehouse over, Benny--and somebody <i>else</i> fired some shots at us from where he ran to! How <i>many</i> do you think are out there, and are they <i>cops</i>?</p>

<p>BENNY: I don't know, and I don't <i>care</i>, Oscar--all I know is that <i>you're</i> going to keep an <i>eye</i> on that <i>bastard</i> out there near the <i>fence</i>! I'll go back inside and get the Boss and the others! <i>(Leaves while Oscar scowls after him, then looks back to the fence)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the warehouse nearest the front gate)</i></p>



     <p>A completely-soaked Daria, Jane, and the others had worked their way up to beside the warehouse, still constantly looking around for anyone, but finding no one. Trent, at the front, was about to motion everyone to go on, when he <i>stumbled</i> into a water-filled open barrel, which was sitting beside the outer wall, and almost had tipped it <i>over</i>, making a <i>rattling</i> sound while splashing some water out of it, but was held up at the last second by Nick, Jesse, and Max. Jane, who along with Daria had been trailing in the rear, scowled at her brother, then came up to him, and spoke.</p>


<p>JANE: Geez, Trent, why not just <i>announce</i> our arrival with an <i>airhorn</i>, why dontcha?!</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Scowls right back:) Hey</i>, Janey--lay off! It's still raining pretty <i>hard</i> out here--I don't think anybody <i>heard</i> us! Besides, I didn't <i>see</i> the barrel, okay?</p> 

<p>JANE: It was right there in <i>front</i> of you! It wasn't exactly <i>invisible</i>, you know!? <i>(Pauses:)</i> And <i>remember</i>, we <i>did</i> hear those <i>shots</i> in the rain!</p>


     <p>While Trent and Jane were glaring at one another, Daria noticed something protruding out of the top of the barrel. She made her way between Jesse and Nick and looked in it, then turned to the two Lane siblings.</p>


<p>DARIA: Um, guys!? <i>(Starts to reach into the barrel with both hands)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(While still glaring at Trent:)</i> Yeah, Daria!?</p>


     <p>Daria pulled out some old, rusted <i>pipes</i> in each hand, about an inch-and-a-half in diameter, and about two feet long in length. She started to smirk as Jane and Trent looked at her with everyone else.</p>


<p>DARIA: I think we've found Jesse's <i>weapons</i>--there's <i>several</i> more in here. <i>(Jane and the others look at each other, and begin to smirk as well as they all reach into the barrel)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the middle warehouse)</i></p>



     <p>Bert and Ernie were about to go outside through a side fire door and find out what was going on, when they suddenly ran into a soaked <i>Benny</i>, who came from outside through the same door. He was about to say something, when William came up behind Bert and Ernie.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Frowns:)</i> What in the hell's going on, Benny? Were those <i>shots</i> we heard?</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Wide-eyed, gasps for breath:)</i> Y-yeah, Boss--Oscar and I saw some people outside while we were making our round, and we fired some <i>shots</i> at them, and they fired <i>back</i> at us! I don't know how many are <i>out</i> there, but Oscar has one <i>S.O.B.</i> in a ditch <i>pinned</i> in on the other side of the fence! Another guy had just scaled it, and apparently, he was following yet <i>another</i> guy who had already climbed the fence, because <i>that</i> guy <i>fired</i> at us! I think he and the other guy are in the next warehouse over!</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>DAMN</i>! All right--Bert, Ernie, I want you to see if you two can find the <i>asses</i> that took some shots at Oscar and Benny--take off. <i>(Both go outside by the door and do so)</i> Benny, I'm going to go back into the bay area and <i>finish off</i> my <i>"nephew"</i>, then join them--that <i>dimwit</i> Norwood is watching over him until I get back!</p>

<p>BENNY: Aww, geez, Boss--I wanted to <i>be</i> there to <i>see</i> you do it!</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> Now, now, Benny--tell you what--why don't you go and finish off Darren's <i>family</i> as a <i>consolation</i> prize?</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Brightens up:)</i> You really <i>mean</i> it, Boss?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: Sure! I had told my <i>"nephew"</i> I was going to get <i>rid</i> of them <i>anyway</i>! Knock yourself <i>out</i>!</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>Thanks</i>, Boss! <i>(Leaves to the next warehouse over by the same door as Bert and Ernie)</i></p>


     <p>William went back to where he left Darren and Norwood in the large bay, holding his gun. As he looked at the spotlight in the center of the bay, he began to <i>frown</i>, confused at the sight. He went closer, and saw that the chair that had Darren was <i>empty</i>, laying over to one side with the ropes strung out on them, and Norwood was <i>gone</i> as well. He stared at the chair for a second more, <i>realized</i> something, then quickly ran back into the darkness.</p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to David in the ditch, outside)</i></p>



     <p>David couldn't move without being shot at, and he <i>knew</i> it. From his rainy vantage point, he could only see the warehouses, but knew at least one of the men were <i>watching</i> him, <i>waiting</i> for him to move out. David felt <i>helpless</i>, cursing his luck--Woo and Leroy were somewhere in there, and he was stuck out here unable to do <i>anything</i> but stay in the ditch. He frowned to himself.</p>


<p>DAVID: <i>(Thought v.o.: The <b>hell</b> with this--I gotta do <b>something</b>, maybe find better cover. Maybe the rain will provide enough of a cover--here goes) (Starts to get out of the ditch)</i></p>


    <p>Oscar watched the ditch intently, shivering, and soaked to the bone. When this was all <i>over</i>, he was going to ask for a <i>triple</i> bonus--he felt he <i>deserved</i> it for all of this <i>mess</i>. Oscar started to think about what he was going to do with the extra money, when he saw the man who had been in the ditch suddenly <i>jump</i> out. Oscar <i>grinned</i>.</p>


<p>OSCAR: <i>(Aims his gun, thought v.o.: So long, <b>chump</b>)</i></p> 


     <p>Oscar was about to fire when he felt a <i>thud</i> on the back of his <i>head</i>. He slumped forward face-first, and fell to the pavement. <i>Trent</i> looked him over along with the others.</p>


<p>TRENT: <i>Got</i> im'! <i>(Looks back at Daria and Jane:)</i> Uh, he <i>is</i> one of the <i>bad</i> guys, right?!</p>


     <p>Daria and Jane turned the man over and looked at him.</p>


<p>DARIA: He wasn't with Woo and his men, so <i>yeah</i>, I think you did!</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Grins:)</i> I <i>concur</i>, amiga--<i>one</i> bad guy down, a <i>million</i> more to go!</p>

<p>NICK: What should we <i>do</i> with him?</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>Move</i> 'em some place out of the way, dudes--he won't be waking up for <i>awhile</i>! <i>(Picks up the man's gun, while Nick, Jess, and Max do so:)</i> Now, we got a <i>real</i> weapon!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks uncomfortable:)</i> Uh, do you know <i>how</i> to <i>use</i> a gun, Trent?!</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Waves it around:)</i> How <i>hard</i> could it <i>be</i>, Daria!? Just <i>point</i> and <i>shoot</i> it!</p>

<p>JANE: Hey, <i>I</i> can--</p>

<p>TRENT: No offense, Janey, but <i>reading</i> a gun magazine, and actually <i>holding</i> a <i>real</i> gun are two <i>different</i> things! <i>(Jane frowns) I'll</i> keep the gun--it'll be <i>safer</i> if <i>I</i> do it!</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Curt:) Fine</i>! <i>(Turns to a surprised Daria, begins to pull her by the arm:)</i> C'mon, Daria--</p>

<p>TRENT: --Hey, Janey--where are you going?!</p>

<p>JANE: To get my <i>own</i> gun! We can help out Woo and his men better by <i>splitting up</i> anyway!</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Alarmed:)</i> Janey, <i>wait</i>--it's <i>not</i> safe for us to be separated!</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Turns back to Trent, sneers:)</i> You've got a <i>gun</i>, bro--so why shouldn't <i>you</i> feel <i>safer</i>!? <i>(Continues on, pulls Daria)</i></p>

<p>TRENT: But--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks back at Trent:)</i> --I'll try to watch out for her, Trent! You guys see if you can find my family and Sandi, too! <i>(Fades off into the rainy darkness with Jane)</i></p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Watches after them:) Damn, it</i> Janey--you're <i>stubborn</i>, you know that!? <i>(Thought v.o.: Watch out for her, Daria.)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to one of the warehouses)</i></p>



     <p>Bert and Ernie started to go down a long, dark, wide area with their guns drawn--the area was currently being used as a storage space for several stacks of crates. They thought they had heard some sort of <i>noise</i> up ahead. Ernie leaned over to Bert and whispered.</p>


<p>ERNIE: You <i>sure</i> Benny said these guys are over here?</p>

<p>BERT: <i>(Whispers as well:)</i> Yeah, I <i>did</i>--now <i>shut up</i>! We don't want to <i>give away</i> our <i>position</i>!</p>


     <p>The next instant, a stack of crates that both men were standing beside of, suddenly fell on <i>top</i> of both men, pinning them and simultaneously knocking the wind out of them. <i>Woo</i> and <i>Leroy</i>, who had been on <i>top</i> of the stacks beside the one that fell on the men, jumped down and looked at the pile of wood, arms, and legs.</p>


<p>WOO: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Too <i>late. (Looks at Leroy:)</i> Nice <i>kick</i>.</p>

<p>LEROY: <i>(Smirks as well:)</i> You too--I used to be a <i>punter</i> on my college football team.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>Midfielder</i> for me on my college soccer team. Think you can handle this?</p>

<p>LEROY: Got you <i>covered</i>. I saw a roll of packing <i>twine</i> nearby
--you find the hostages, and I'll join you after I tie them up--be <i>careful</i>, Woo.</p>

<p>WOO: I <i>always</i> am. <i>(Leaves)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene goes to the warehouse where Helen, Jake, Quinn, and Sandi are)</i></p>



     <p>Benny checked his gun clip for the right amount of ammo just as he walked into the warehouse. He wanted to make sure he had <i>enough</i> for the job. Benny <i>paused</i> for a moment. He was going to <i>cold-bloodedly</i> kill some <i>helpless</i> people. Benny had <i>never</i> done such a thing before, but he decided <i>long</i> ago to not <i>allow</i> his <i>conscience</i> to bother him--<i>especially</i> when it came to business. He remembered <i>toiling</i> in the mailrooms as a just-graduated-from-business-school office worker until that fateful time <i>22 years ago</i> when he had first met <i>William Appleton</i> while delivering some <i>mail</i> to him in his office. Awed by William's <i>"commanding"</i> presence, Benny remembered having asked him <i>countless</i> times about how to get <i>ahead</i> in business, and William had <i>marvelled</i> over Benny's <i>eagerness</i> to learn. William then took Benny on as a <i>protege</i>, and Benny's career took off. Having <i>never</i> forgotten, Benny felt <i>complete</i> loyalty to his <i>"Boss"</i>, and now Benny <i>smirked</i> to himself, feeling <i>nothing</i>--to him, <i>this</i> was <i>business</i> as well. He was about to go to the far <i>back</i> of the warehouse where the hostages were, when he heard what seemed to be <i>struggling</i> and <i>muffled</i> sounds up ahead in the dim light. Benny cocked his gun, and cautiously proceeded forward.</p>

     <p>Benny went about <i>50</i> feet, and was <i>shocked</i> to find a wide-eyed and panicked <i>Norwood</i> looking at him tied up <i>face-first</i> and <i>gagged</i> with his arms around each side of one of the large columns that held up the ceiling of this particular warehouse. <i>Hold it</i>--if <i>Norwood</i> was <i>here</i>, then where was--</p>

     <p>Before he could <i>finish</i> that thought, he felt a <i>kick</i> in his lower back from <i>behind</i>, which threw him forward onto the floor, and also <i>dislodged</i> his gun, which slid on the concrete floor into the darkness, and away from the dimmed lights. Wincing in pain, he grabbed his back and turned around while on the floor--even before he did, he knew <i>instantly</i> who had <i>done</i> it. Before him standing was a sight that <i>terrified</i> him--an enraged <i>Darren Appleton</i>, who began to speak in a <i>savage</i> tone of voice, whispering, as he began to slowly <i>advance</i> on Benny.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Sneers down at Benny:) Hello</i>, Benny.</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Trembles, hold up his hands:)</i> O-oh, <i>God</i>, Darren--p-please don't <i>do</i> this! I-I was only <i>following</i> William's <i>orders</i>!</p> 

<p>DARREN: I <i>could</i> and <i>should</i> kill you, Benny--but you're <i>not</i> worth it, oh, no--<i>that</i> honor goes to my dear <i>"uncle". (Reaches over in the dark, pulls out a rope, and a rag:)</i> Get up--go ahead, make a <i>sound</i>--give me an <i>excuse</i> to <i>beat</i> you into the ground--assume the same position Norwood has. <i>(Benny timidly stands up, goes over to the same column Norwood's at on the other side)</i></p>


     <p>Darren gagged Benny, then tied Benny's arms around the post like Norwood's, making sure to pull a little extra <i>hard</i> on Benny's arms, which made Benny <i>wince</i>.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(In a mocking tone:)</i> Oh, did I make you feel <i>uncomfortable</i>? I'm <i>so</i> sorry! <i>(Leaves)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the other side of the same warehouse)</i></p>



     <p>A throughly-soaked Daria and Jane had found an unlocked door and had entered the warehouse through the side. The wall that they were beside of consisted of old and cracked windows, <i>not</i> broken like on some of the others, and it overlooked the inlet. Both were still carrying their pipe <i>"weapons"</i>. Daria looked over at a <i>brooding</i> Jane, speaking in a whisper.</p>


<p>DARIA: We shouldn't have <i>left</i> Trent and the guys. I know that you think he treats you like a <i>baby</i> sometimes, but it's only because he <i>cares</i>, Jane.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Through clenched teeth, slightly louder voice, frowns:)</i> Damn it, Daria, you don't think I <i>know</i> that? I'm just freakin' <i>sick-and tired</i> of people who keep <i>suffocating</i> me in the name of <i>"love"</i> and <i>"care"</i>! I can take care of <i>myself</i>!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Small smirk:)</i> Hmmm, I'm <i>wondering</i>--did <i>Tom "suffocate"</i> you like that--<i>(Jane glares at Daria)</i> and if so, will you be that way with my <i>bro</i> when <i>he "suffocates"</i> you with <i>"love"</i> and <i>"care"</i>, too?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Stops, cocks an eyebrow:)</i> Just what <i>are</i> you getting at, Daria?</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Realizes she may have hit a nerve here, gingerly tries to handle the situation:)</i> That, um, well, you sometimes have this <i>tendency</i> to want to do everything your <i>own</i> way, Jane. From what I understand, a relationship has to be a <i>team</i> effort, not just a <i>one-way street</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Frowns, angered:)</i> Whoa--where did <i>this</i> come from? I gave <i>more</i> than I got with Tom! He wanted to control <i>me</i>, remember? Darren's <i>not</i> like that!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Frowns herself:)</i> I never said that Darren <i>would</i> control you, Jane--but I can see that my bro does <i>care</i> for you. I think he might feel kind of <i>hurt</i> if you don't let him be there <i>for</i> you.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>Waaaaait</i> a second, amiga--Darren <i>was</i> there for me when he saved my <i>life</i>--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Cuts her off gently:)</i> --No, that's <i>not</i> what I'm talking about, Jane--I mean, when Darren's gonna want to <i>help</i> you down the <i>road</i> if you two start to become--more <i>(pauses:)--"serious"</i> with each other? <i>(Jane looks away for a second, red-faced)</i> You know, with his <i>money</i>, or something--like when you go to <i>college</i>? <i>(Jane frowns again, this time out of <b>confusion</b>)</i> Are you gonna <i>allow</i> him to do so if he offers, or are you gonna say, <i>"No thanks, I can do this on my <b>own</b> like everything <b>else</b> in my life, and I don't need anybody."</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> Daria, <i>please</i>--I <i>told</i> you I don't give a <i>damn</i> about Darren's wealth--I-like-<i>him. (Shrugs:)</i> If he wants to offer a <i>little</i> money to help me, well, I'd uh--<i>consider</i> it.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sarcastic:)</i> Oh--well--that's <i>different</i>, then--that you'd <i>"consider"</i> my bro's offer of <i>"help"</i>, and <i>not</i> accept it <i>outright</i>. I'm sure Darren would understand <i>that</i> little <i>quirk</i> of yours <i>perfectly</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Would <i>you</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Arches an eyebrow:) Come</i> again?</p>

<p>JANE: Like I said--would <i>you</i> accept your brother's offer of money for college, or in that fact, something <i>else</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Narrows eyes:)</i> "Something else", liiiiike--</p>

<p>JANE: I dunno--what if he wanted to get you a new <i>car</i>, or something? He would <i>do</i> it, you know, if you <i>asked</i> him to. <i>(Pauses, smirks:)</i> I know <i>Quinn</i> would do it in an <i>instant</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Quinn would ask Darren for a whole damn <i>lot</i> of cars, <i>planes</i>, and <i>yachts</i>, not to mention <i>expensive</i> wardrobes, <i>mountain retreats</i>--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>Exactly</i>, and stop giving me the <i>obvious</i> crappy <i>runaround</i>, here. Would <i>you</i> accept <i>money</i> from your bro if he <i>offered</i> it? <i>(Pauses:)</i> It would seem to me that you <i>would. (Daria frowns at Jane, angered)</i> Hey, before you answer, <i>think</i> about it for a second--you take money from your <i>parents</i> when they <i>offer</i> it--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sighs:)</i> --Jane, my parents offer me money outright about as often as Quinn <i>refuses</i> to take it when they offer it to her--which you know what the <i>answer</i> is to that. I have to sometimes get them into my little "guilt-trip" schemes, and such--</p>

<p>JANE: --Which you no <i>longer</i> would have to do now that your bro--</p>

<p>DARIA: --And your <i>boyfriend</i>--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Annoyed slightly:)</i> --is <i>Richie Rich</i>. You've basically got it <i>made</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: I'd <i>never</i> take <i>advantage</i> of my bro, Jane, I--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Grins:) --Care</i> about him too much to do so?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Glares for a moment:)</i> I just want to make it on my <i>own</i>, that's all. I wouldn't want to become a--<i>sponge</i> like Quinn. I have my <i>scruples</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Quietly:)</i> But if Darren offered to help you out of--brotherly <i>love</i>?</p>


     <p>Daria stared at Jane wide-eyed for a moment and looked away. Jane smirked. <i>Gotcha, amiga--admit you're <b>fond</b> of him.</i> After a long pause, Daria was about to answer when both were <i>interrupted</i>.</p>


<p>VOICE FROM THE DARK: <i>Boooooring</i>. I <i>knew</i> Darren would be <i>perceived</i> differently once his birth family found out he had the <i>moolah</i>! <i>(Daria and Jane jump at the voice, hold their pipes in a defensive stance)</i> Oh, come now--do you <i>really</i> think <i>those</i> "weapons" would do any good against <i>my</i> weapon, ladies? <i>(Source of the voice comes out of the dark into the dim lights, points a gun at them, grins, speaks in a perky voice:) Hi</i>!</p>

<p>DARIA: Who in the <i>hell</i> are you--the answer to the <i>"Good Humor Man"</i>?</p>

<p>MAN: Nooo--I'm far <i>worse</i>--the name's <i>William Appleton</i>, and Darren's <i>uncle</i>, and little <i>ringleader</i> of the people who have your family hostage. You know, I don't think I would have <i>noticed</i> you both a second ago if you hadn't said anything--those are the <i>breaks</i>, I guess. <i>(Smirks:)</i> Drop your "weapons", please. <i>(Both girls look at each other, do so, and the pipes hitting the floor make a noise) Oh, dear</i>
--that'll probably get my nephew's <i>attention</i>, if <i>Benny</i> doesn't get to him <i>first</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Scowls:)</i> So <i>Woo</i> was right! You're the <i>bastard</i> who's behind all of this!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Rolls her eyes, thought v.o.: Way to go, Lane--give up the element of <b>surprise</b> to this slimeball--he'll know to watch out for Woo and his men now.)</i> What do you mean, <i>"If Benny doesn't get to him first"</i>? <i>(Pauses, smirks:)</i> Are you saying Darren's running around here <i>free</i> to cause some <i>mischief</i>? <i>(Jane smirks)</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>I</i> wouldn't worry about Darren if I were <i>you</i>, my dear. <i>(Looks around:)</i> So, <i>Woo's</i> behind all of the <i>trouble</i>, eh? <i>(Scowls:)</i> I <i>knew</i> I should've went on ahead and <i>eliminated</i> that <i>S.O.B.</i> when I had the <i>chance</i>! Well, I'm <i>sure</i> that my men will take <i>care</i> of him. <i>(Pauses, frowns:)</i> Who <i>are</i> you two, anyway?</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> I'm <i>Betty Crocker</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Ditto:)</i> And I'm <i>Sara Lee</i>. We can make some <i>pastries</i> for you--</p>

<p>DARIA: --And then we'll gladly <i>shove</i> them up your <i>big, greedy corporate ass</i>.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Scowls slightly:)</i> Oh, I have two <i>wise-asses</i>, here, eh? Well, if you're here to <i>"rescue"</i> the hostages, I'm afraid you're too <i>late</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Turns pale with Jane:)</i> What--do you mean, <i>"too late"</i>?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(In a calm voice:)</i> Why, my assistant Benny has <i>killed</i> them all, that's what I mean, <i>"Betty Crocker". (Daria's eyes grow big with horror)</i> Oh, they must've meant <i>something</i> to you, eh? You must be the <i>other</i> sister--huh--you're not much of a <i>looker</i>, are you? <i>(Daria and Jane frown at him while William grins wickedly:)</i> This is <i>delightful</i>--first I take <i>Darren's</i> adopted family away, and now <i>your</i> family too--and Darren's <i>birth</i> family!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Scowls deeply, horrified:)</i> YOU BASTARD! YOU--YOU KILLED <i>MY FAMILY</i>!? <i>(Starts to go toward William in a <b>rage</b>, which surprises Jane and even William)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to somewhere in the same warehouse, a minute <b>earlier</b>)</i></p>



     <p>Darren was making his way to the room where his birth family and Sandi were being held when he had heard what sounded like a <i>metallic</i> sound on the other side of the warehouse. He had paused for a moment, wondering if he should <i>ignore</i> the sound and continue on, since he was pretty well-hidden in the dark, but on a second thought decided to <i>check out</i> the source of the sound--Darren had been sure that <i>Benny</i> was probably sent to <i>kill</i> Darren's birth family and Sandi since Benny was in this warehouse, but Darren had <i>"secured"</i> Benny (as well as Norwood), so Darren figured his birth family and Sandi were <i>safe</i> for the time being.</p> 

     <p>A <i>second</i> thought went through Darren's head--what was the <i>source</i> of those <i>shots</i> he had heard? Not that he was <i>complaining</i> of the <i>timing</i> of them occurring, of course, but could his <i>prayers</i> have been <i>answered</i>? Was someone <i>helping</i> him and the others? Darren was still on this thought when he heard a <i>cry</i> that <i>resonated</i> throughout the warehouse, about <i>200</i> feet in front of him--it sounded somewhat <i>familiar</i>, but he couldn't quite place it. He quickened his pace in the direction of the cry, and came out to the edge of the darkness, <i>stunned</i>.</p>

    <p>About 100 feet in front of him, he saw a wet and dirty <i>Daria</i> and <i>Jane</i>, and his uncle <i>William</i> standing, but even <i>more</i> shocking was what <i>Daria</i> was doing--she was rushing <i>toward</i> his uncle in a full <i>fury</i>--and this as William had a <i>gun</i> on her. Horrified, Darren rushed forward.</p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to a warehouse <b>beside</b> the one Daria and the others are in, about <b>five</b> minutes <b>earlier</b> than Darren seeing Daria and Jane)</i></p>



     <p>Trent, Jesse, Nick, and Max came inside and dried themselves off, in a dimmed space, looking around carefully.</p>


<p>TRENT: Damn it--Janey's somewhere around here, and she could be in <i>trouble</i>! Why didn't I just <i>force</i> her to come with us?</p>

<p>JESSE: Hey, c'mon, man--you know Jane's got her <i>own</i> mind, right? There was nothing you could do--</p>

<p>TRENT: --Except get herself and Daria <i>killed</i>! I'm going <i>after</i> them both--</p>

<p>VOICE FROM THE DARK: <i>Hold</i> it--<i>drop</i> your gun and thoses pipes you're all holding. <i>(Trent and the others look around)</i> I <i>won't</i> ask <i>again. (Trent grudgingly throws down his gun, and the others drop their pipes)</i></p>

<p>MAX: <i>(Terrified voice:)</i> S-so much for being <i>criminales</i>, man--we're <i>dead</i>.</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(In a weak voice, pale:) Janey, Daria--</i></p>


     <p>The source of the voice came out, and a wet, blond-haired, goateed burly-looking man came out of the darkness with a gun pointed at Trent and the others.</p>


<p>NICK: <i>(Scared:)</i> H-hey, man, d-don't <i>shoot</i>--I-I've got a <i>daughter</i>--</p>

<p>JESSE: <i>(Ditto:)</i> Y-yeah, er--me <i>too</i>, dude--</p>

<p>MAX: A-and <i>me</i>!</p>

<p>TRENT: Uhhh--I guess we can't make a <i>deal</i>?</p>

<p>MAN: <i>(Looks at them strangely:)</i> You all don't <i>look</i> like <i>bad</i> guys--other than the fact that you're <i>wet</i> and <i>dirty</i>--</p>

<p>MAX: Hey, man--speak for <i>yourself</i>! <i>(Trent, Nick, and Jesse scowl at him)</i> W-what?</p>

<p>TRENT: We don't wanna get this guy <i>upset</i>, Max--<i>(realizes:)</i> hey, did you say we don't <i>look</i> like bad guys?</p>

<p>MAN: That's what I said. Who are you?</p>

<p>TRENT: We're a band called <i>Mystik Spiral</i>--</p>

<p>MAN: <i>(Raised eyebrows:) Mystik Spiral</i>? A <i>Jane Lane</i> told us about your band on the way over here! <i>(Trent cocks an eyebrow)</i></p>

<p>JESSE: Hey, man, you came here with Jane and Daria?</p>

<p>MAN: Yes--how do you know Jane and Daria?</p>

<p>TRENT: I'm her <i>brother</i>, man--we were coming from a nearby town called Leeville, when I saw her riding in <i>your</i> car. I got <i>concerned</i>, we followed your car, and came here. You work for that <i>"Woo"</i> guy?</p>

<p>MAN: <i>(Lowers his gun:)</i> Yes, I'm <i>David</i>. Gerald Woo is my employer, and I have another partner, <i>Leroy</i>, who is with Woo somewhere around here--<i>alive</i>, I hope. I was able to only come in here after I made my way through the <i>front gate</i> by an <i>incredible</i> stroke of luck.</p>

<p>TRENT: Yeah, we came here with Daria and Janey through the front gate, too. We made our way around some of the warehouses, and I was able to <i>whack</i> a guy who was leaning against the side of one of them watching the <i>fence</i> for some reason--<i>(pauses:)</i> uh--I hope he wasn't that <i>Leroy</i> or <i>Woo</i> guy--Janey and Daria said he wasn't. Jesse, Max, and Nick put him in a <i>tool</i> shed beside one of the warehouses--he's gonna be out for awhile.</p>

<p>DAVID: <i>(Grins:)</i> So <i>you're</i> the ones who kept that fellow from firing at me when I got out of that ditch! Good work, and for the record, <i>(looks at the gun on the floor which Trent had dropped:)</i> I can say for a <i>fact</i> that was <i>not</i> Woo or Leroy, because they didn't carry a <i>Smith & Wesson</i> with them in here. <i>(Looks around, becomes alarmed:) Wait a minute</i>--did you say your <i>sister</i> and Daria Morgendorrfer came in <i>with</i> you? <i>Where</i> are they <i>now</i>?</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Looks down:) Uhhh</i>--me and my sister had a little <i>argument</i>, and they went off on their <i>own</i>--I don't know <i>where</i> they are.</p>

<p>DAVID: <i>(Scowls:)</i> You let your <i>sister</i> and her best friend <i>go</i> to God-knows-where, and you don't know where they <i>are</i>!? They could be in <i>danger</i>!</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Scowls back:) Chill</i>, man! Janey and Daria can take care of themselves!</p>

<p>DAVID: Oh!? Do <i>they</i> have a <i>gun</i>!?</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Looks at the gun on the floor:)</i> Uhhh--not <i>really</i>--</p>


     <p>David was about to say something else, when <i>Leroy</i> came out of the dark.</p> 


<p>LEROY: <i>(Sees David, smiles:) David</i>, my man!</p>

<p>DAVID: <i>(Smiles:)</i> What's goin' down, Leroy?</p>

<p>LEROY: <i>(Looks at Trent and the others:)</i> I see you got some <i>more</i> bad guys?</p>

<p>DAVID: Nope--these are <i>good</i> guys--it's kind of a long story to get into. Where's <i>Woo</i>?</p> 

<p>LEROY: He's gone after the <i>hostages</i>. He and I took care of some bad guys in one of the other warehouses--there were <i>two</i> of them. I tied them up.</p>

<p>DAVID: Great--and Trent and his friends here took care of <i>another</i> one--<i>(Leroy looks at Trent and the others, impressed)</i> so that makes <i>three</i>. Do you think there are any others?</p>

<p>LEROY: I don't know--let's find out.</p>

<p>DAVID: Right behind you--<i>(starts to leave with Leroy)</i></p>

<p>TRENT: Hey, what about <i>us</i>?</p>

<p>DAVID: Maybe you guys should <i>stay</i> here--</p>

<p>TRENT: --C'mon, man--this is my <i>sister</i> and her best friend and her family we're talking about--besides, we took care of that guy that had <i>you</i> pinned down. <i>(Leroy cocks an eyebrow at David)</i> The way I figured it, you <i>owe</i> us!</p>

<p>DAVID: <i>(After a moment, sighs:)</i> Okay, all right! You guys came come <i>with</i> us--but let Leroy and I <i>lead</i>, okay? <i>(Trent and the others nod)</i> And you'll have to do <i>exactly</i> what we tell you to do if we encounter <i>trouble</i>, got that?</p>

<p>JESSE: It's <i>cool</i>, man.</p>

<p>LEROY: Then pick <i>up</i> that gun and those pipes, guys, and let's <i>book. (Leaves with the others behind him and David into the darkness)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the room where Helen, Jake, Quinn, and Sandi are--the same time as when David first meets Mystik Spiral)</i></p>



     <p>Helen and Jake were <i>resting</i> for the moment from their struggling from the ropes while Quinn and Sandi were <i>still</i> going at it, so much so that both girls had fallen over onto the <i>floor</i>.</p> 


<p>SANDI: Come <i>on</i>, Quinn--like, I can feel the ropes <i>loosening</i>! <i>(Thought v.o.: This floor is <b>sooo</b> icky--I'll bet <b>my</b> dress is still <b>cleaner</b> than Quinn's!)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: Y-yeah, Sandi, I think they <i>are</i>! <i>(Thought v.o.: Sandi's color is pickin' up a whole lot <b>more</b> dirt than my dress is!)</i></p>


     <p>Helen nudged her head to bump Jake's.</p>


<p>HELEN: Come on, Jakey--rest time's <i>over</i>--we've <i>got</i> to get free--the girl's say that <i>their</i> ropes are <i>slipping</i>--I think <i>our's</i> are, too! <i>(Struggles, ponders:)</i> I wonder why no one came in <i>here</i> after we heard those <i>shots</i>?</p>

<p>JAKE: Don't tell me you're <i>complaining</i> about that, honey--I know <i>I'm</i> not! <i>(Struggles while Helen glares back at him for an instant:)</i> UHHGGH! Helen--I don't think these ropes have budged <i>one</i> damned inch! That masked guy must be a <i>world-class knot-tier</i>!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Sighs:)</i> Jake we have to work <i>with</i> each other, not <i>against</i> one another! Now go in the direction <i>I</i> go, okay?</p>

<p>JAKE: A-okay, honey! <i>(Starts rocking with Helen back and forth:)</i> Hey, this is kinda <i>fun</i>! <i>(Helen glares back at him again)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Red-faced:)</i> Just-a-little-more--<i>(ropes start to <b>loosen</b>)</i> Sandi, they're comin' <i>loose</i>!</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Ditto:) Quh--inn</i>! Getting <i>over-excited</i> is <i>very</i> unfashionable--but you are <i>correct. (Ropes start to fall off both of them:)</i> We're like, <i>free</i>!</p>

<p>HELEN: Then help <i>us</i>, you two! <i>(Quinn and Sandi go over, untie the loosened ropes off of Helen and Jake, and they get up as well)</i></p>


     <p>After stretching for a moment, everyone went to the door to the room. Jake slowly put his finger to his mouth, motioning everyone to keep quiet, and then tried then doorknob. It was <i>still</i> locked.</p>


<p>JAKE: <i>(Jiggles the knob:)</i> Aw, <i>crap</i>! <i>(Starts to get <b>angry</b>:)</i> Why in the HELL DOESN'T THIS <i>DAMN</i>--</p>

<p>HELEN: JAKE! <i>(Whispers:)</i> Will you calm <i>down</i>? Those <i>evil</i> men may be <i>outside</i> the door or nearby!</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Whines in a whispering tone:)</i> We'll <i>never</i> get outta here!</p>

<p>SANDI: Now, Quinn--<i>negative</i> thinking is a Fashion Club <i>no-no</i>!</p>

<p>QUINN: Uh, <i>sorry</i>, Sandi--you're <i>right. (Sandi nods curtly)</i></p>


     <p>Helen was about to suggest something when the doorknob started to move from the <i>other</i> side. Everyone backed up from the door wide-eyed, save for <i>Jake</i>, who <i>stood</i> his ground.</p>


<p>JAKE: <i>(Angry, frowns:)</i> I'll be <i>damned</i> if I allow any of you to be <i>tied</i> up again--or <i>shot</i>! When this guy comes in, I'll <i>take</i> 'em on!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Alarmed:)</i> Jakey, <i>no</i>!</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Determined look, growls:)</i> Sorry, honey, but it's either him <i>or</i> us!</p>

<p>QUINN: Daddy, be careful!</p>

<p>SANDI: Like, what Quinn said!</p>


     <p>The door <i>opened</i>, and Jake promptly <i>charged</i>. He ran into a <i>wet</i>, burly, Asian-American man, and <i>immediately</i> fell <i>back</i> on the floor, dazed. Helen and Quinn rushed to Jake's aid, while Sandi backed against the far wall, scared out of her wits. The man spoke to them in a <i>calming</i> voice.</p>


<p>MAN: Please don't be <i>alarmed</i>--I don't wish you <i>any</i> harm--in fact, I just came here from the <i>rear</i> of the building to <i>rescue</i> you. My name's <i>Gerald Woo</i>.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Pauses, realizes:) Gerald Woo</i>? The--the <i>detective</i> our son <i>told</i> us about? H-how did you--</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Serious tone:)</i> --There's <i>no</i> time to explain Mrs. Morgendorffer--I have to get you all <i>out</i> of here, and--<i>(hears a <b>scream</b> from the far right end:)</i> what in the <i>world</i>--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Appalled:)</i> That sounded like--like--<i>Daria</i>! <i>(Woo rushes out, Helen and the others follow him)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the <b>present</b> time, same warehouse with Daria, Jane, Darren and William)</i></p>



     <p>Daria went at a surprised William so <i>fast</i>, he did <i>not</i> have time to point his gun and <i>shoot</i> her, so he did the <i>next</i> best thing (to him)--he used the <i>butt</i> of the gun he was holding, and <i>struck</i> Daria in the <i>face</i>, knocking her back onto Jane, and both fell onto the floor. William quickly regained his senses, and pointed his gun at the girls.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Wicked sneer:)</i> Good riddance to bad <i>rubbish</i>, I always say--say hello to <i>Darren</i> in <i>hell</i> for me, will you?</p> 


     <p>The next few seconds went like a <i>blur</i>--before William could pull the trigger, <i>Darren</i> came <i>running</i> out of the dark in a <i>rage</i>. As William turned towards him, Darren <i>leapt</i> up, and kicked his uncle <i>hard</i> and <i>flat</i> in the <i>chest</i> with all the force he could muster, and <i>then</i> some. This action made William drop the gun, and it <i>discharged</i> when it hit the floor--hitting <i>Darren</i> squarely in his left <i>shoulder</i>, and knocking him back to the floor. A <i>screaming</i> William meanwhile fell through the <i>window</i> beside them all simultaneously, and into the black darkness of the heavy rain and wind-driven storm, hitting the water inlet. A stunned Daria and Jane jumped up off the floor, and rushed to a now-wounded Darren, who looked up weakly to his sister and girlfriend. <i>Blood</i> was <i>pouring</i> out of his shoulder. Both girls <i>snatched</i> off their jackets and put them on Darren, Jane's going on the top, and Daria's on the bottom, beneath Darren. Darren struggled to speak, shaking from the intense pain of his shoulder, and looking between the two.</p>


<p>DARREN: A-are b-both of you a-all r-right--?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Holds down Jane's jacket on Darren while on her knees, tries to hold back her <b>tears</b>:)</i> Y-yeah, we are, b-bro--oh, God--Darren, don't--don't try to speak.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Tears roll down her eyes, does the same:)</i> D-Darren, D-Daria's <i>right</i>--don't s-say anything. P-please don't say anything.</p>

<p>DARREN: L-let me s-say t-this, please--I-I'm s-sorry f-for the <i>lies</i>, sis, Jane--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Now tears slowly come down from her eyes:)</i> I-it doesn't matter, bro--just rest, okay? <i>(Looks desperate:)</i> J-Jane, we-we gotta get some help!</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Sobs, gets up, screams:)</i> SOMEBODY <b>HELP</b> US, DAMN IT! IS ANYBODY HERE!?</p>


     <p>Gerald Woo ran out of the darkness, and was <i>stunned</i> by the sight in front of him for a moment, then he reached into his jacket, and pulled out his cell phone. He <i>fervently</i> dialed 911.</p>


<p>WOO: Hello? 911? We need an <i>ambulance</i>, damn it! We have a person that's been <i>shot</i> at the--<i>(looks at Jane again, turns the phone to her)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Frantic:)</i> THE CARTER COUNTY BAY WAREHOUSE DISTRICT!!</p>

<p>WOO: Did you <i>get</i> that?! <i>(Pauses:)</i> Good--bring the <i>police</i> as well! We'll have someone out there waiting for you to show you where the injured man is! <i>(Clicks off his phone)</i></p>


     <p>Helen, Jake, and the others started to come out of the darkness, having heard Jane's screams. Helen took the lead, fearing something had happened to <i>Daria</i>--what she saw in front of her was just as horrible, the same for Jake and Quinn--and even for <i>Sandi</i>.</p>


<p>HELEN: <i>(Screams, sobs:)</i> DARREN!! <i>(Rushes up)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Ditto:)</i> SON! <i>(Rushes up)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Screams, sobs:)</i> BRO!! <i>(Rushes up)</i></p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Stunned:)</i> D-DARREN?! <i>(Is about to rush forward, but sees that everyone else has done so, quietly comes up behind the others, secretly horrified)</i></p>


     <p>Jane suddenly stepped in <i>front</i> of the Morgendorffers, <i>furious</i>. Helen, Jake, and Quinn looked at her as if she had lost her mind. Before Helen could say anything, Jane cut her off.</p>


<p>JANE: Mrs. Morgendorffer, Darren <i>needs</i> air! If you all rush up to him like this, it could cut it <i>off</i>! You gotta give him <i>room</i> to breathe! <i>(Leans over to them, tries to overcome her fear, whispers:)</i> T-The <i>last</i> thing Darren needs is to see you all like this--it could make his i-injury <i>worse</i>. Bad enough that <i>I</i> screamed myself.</p>


     <p>Helen held back her <i>fury</i> at Jane, and <i>softened</i> her face, the same for Jake and Quinn--through their red haze, they somehow knew that Jane was <i>right</i>--even <i>Jake</i>. Helen went first, stooping beside a <i>silently</i> sobbing Daria, who was still holding Jane's jacket over Darren's wound.</p> 


<p>HELEN: <i>(Tears up, in a soft tone:)</i> S-son, oh dear Lord--Darren--<i>(caressess his face gently while Darren simply mouths to her "I'm sorry")</i> it'll be all right, son--the ambulance is on it's way--just don't move or say anything, okay, sweetie? <i>(Darren smiles weakly)</i></p>


     <p>Jake then came over beside Helen and stooped down as well, putting his hand gently on his son's chest. He struggled to speak, trying not to cry.</p>


<p>JAKE: E-Easy, Big Guy--<i>(smiles weakly, quiet tone:)</i> d-do what you <i>mom</i> says, okay? <i>(Darren mouths "okay" to Jake)</i></p>


     <p>Quinn suddenly brushed between her parents, got down on her knees on Darren's right side, bent over, and laid her <i>head</i> on Darren's chest, trying to hold back her sobs.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(Whispers:)</i> P-Please d-don't <i>die</i>, Darren--please don't--don't--die. <i>(Begins to sob gently into his chest, and Darren weakly places his right hand on Quinn's hair, gently rubs it)</i></p>


     <p>As Sandi watched everyone gathered around Darren quietly, her tears started to flow, and she privately started to shed her <i>own</i> tears.</p>


<p>SANDI: <i>(Thought v.o.: Oh, Darren--like, you can't die--you--just--<b>can't</b>!)</i></p>


     <p>The next instant, there was a sound of a door opening nearby (the same door Daria and Jane had come through), and Woo pulled out his gun, slowly going up to the source of the noise. The Morgendorffer women covered Darren, while a determined Jane, and even <i>Sandi</i>, stepped in front of them--there was <i>no</i> way anyone was going to come in here to do something now--<i>woe</i> to whoever did.</p>


<p>WOO: <i>(Glances behind:)</i> Stay here, I'm going to--</p>

<p>VOICE IN THE DARK: Woo, is that <i>you</i>?</p> 

<p>WOO: <i>(Lowers his gun a bit:) David</i>?</p>


     <p>David, followed by Leroy, and the members of Mystik Spiral, came out of the dark. Trent saw Jane, and ran up to her, relieved, hugging her.</p>


<p>DAVID: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Yeah, it's us, Woo.</p>

<p>LEROY: <i>(Ditto:)</i> We're all okay--we've checked through all of the other warehouses but this one--besides our two guys, <i>(motions over to Trent:)</i> this <i>"Trent" </i>guy and his friends got <i>another</i> one stored in a tool shed.</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>Janey</i>! Oh man--I'm glad you're all right--and the Morgendorffers as well! <i>(Looks at Sandi:)</i> Oh, and uh, you <i>too. (Sandi looks at Trent stoically)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Quietly:)</i> I'm glad you're okay, too, Trent--<i>(looks back towards Darren and the others:)</i> but not <i>all</i> of us are all right.</p>


     <p>Trent and the other band members, along with David and Leroy, looked past Jane and saw Darren lying on the floor in a small pool of blood, ringed by the Morgendorffers.</p>


<p>TRENT: (Stunned along with the others:) D-Darren</i>? Geez, what happened, Janey?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Tries to control her emotions:)</i> T-That <i>ass</i>, William Appleton, was about to <i>shoot</i> me and Daria, when Darren came out of the dark, and <i>kicked</i> him <i>out</i> of the window. <i>(Sobs:)</i> When that <i>bastard</i> dropped his gun, it went <i>off</i>, and hit Darren in the shoulder. <i>(Begins to cry into Trent's shoulder)</i></p>


     <p>Woo came over to the stunned David and Leroy.</p>


<p>WOO: <i>(Authoritative tone of voice:)</i> Okay, you two--<i>(looks over at Jesse, Nick and Max, as well:)</i> come out of those <i>stun modes</i>, or whatever they are, and <i>move</i> it! David, you and Leroy go out front and direct the ambulance and the police to where Darren is! <i>(David and Leroy immediately do so)</i> As for <i>you</i> fellows, <i>find</i> something to cover that <i>hole</i> in the window--the rain is starting to come in <i>here</i>! <i>(Jesse, Max, and Nick start looking through the warehouse for something)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Comes up:)</i> Uh, Mr. Woo--?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Smiles politely:)</i> Just <i>Woo</i>, please, Mr. Morgendorffer--</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Returns the smile:)</i> Well, you can just call me <i>Jake</i>, then--over our <i>objections</i> that he talk, my son just told us they're two <i>other</i> men in this warehouse on the <i>other</i> side! <i>(Beams proudly:)</i> Darren said he took <i>care</i> of 'em!</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Raises his eyebrows, surprised:) Really</i>? Well, I'll check them out, then--be right back. <i>(Leaves, while Jake goes back to his family)</i></p>


     <p>Daria silently and sadly looked down on her brother while pressing Jane's jacket onto his left shoulder, trying to <i>coagulate</i> the flow of his blood from his body. Her tears still flowed in a slow <i>trickle</i> down her face. Darren looked up at her, and smiled weakly, trying to <i>reassure</i> her, though personally, he was <i>scared</i> as well. Daria gave her small Mona Lisa smile back to him in return. Quinn, on the right side, stayed on her knees, and held his right hand, trying to stay brave. Jane and Trent came up, and watched the scene, with Jane crying quietly into her brother's shoulder, and leaning her head on his chest. Helen was doing the same to Jake.</p>

     <p>Sandi swallowed hard, and came up slowly, looking down at Darren, scared, trying to hold back her emotions. Darren caught her look--<i>she really does like me--maybe she's finally trying to become a decent person</i>. Quinn and Daria looked up at Sandi, and Quinn motioned for Sandi to come down <i>beside</i> her. Sandi was taken <i>aback</i> for a moment by Quinn's invitation, then she reluctantly got down on her knees beside Quinn. Darren smiled at her quietly, then began to <i>speak</i>--Daria and Quinn were trying to keep him from speaking, but he weakly put up his right hand to cut off their protests.</p>


<p>DARREN: J-Just one more time, you two--I <i>have</i> to say this to Sandi, okay? <i>(Daria and Quinn nod reluctantly)</i> I-I'm <i>sorry</i> you got <i>dragged</i> into this, too, Sandi--</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Now sheds tears in a <b>proud</b> manner, gently puts her index finger on Darren's mouth, in a soft tone of voice:) --Shhh</i>--like, don't say anything more, Darren--you just <i>rest</i>, o-okay? <i>(Darren smiles weakly)</i></p>


     <p>Sandi then looked up at <i>Jane</i>, and motioned <i>her</i> to come down beside Darren, to which a slightly surprised Jane did. After Jane got down beside them, Sandi put <i>Darren's</i> hand on <i>Jane's</i>. Daria, Quinn, and especially Jane were <i>shocked</i> by this act from Sandi (though Darren did <i>not</i> seem to be), who then slowly raised herself up in a dignified manner, brushing her skirt off, and went over beside Helen and Jake.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Thought v.o.: Well, who would've <b>thunk</b> it--Sandi <b>does</b> have a <b>conscience</b>--she <b>is</b> human.)</i></p>


<p>SANDI: <i>(In a low voice to both:)</i> Like, Jane's <i>place</i> is beside <i>her</i> boyfriend, don't you think? <i>(Helen and Jake look at Sandi, confused, but saying nothing)</i></p>


     <p>It would take the ambulance and the police an <i>agonizing</i> 15 minutes to show up, thanks to the rain, which was finally starting to <i>recede</i>. David and Leroy, along with Woo, directed the paramedics to Darren, while the police arrested Benny, Norwood, Oscar, Ernie, and Bert, charging them with kidnapping, attempted murder, and <i>"anything <b>else</b> they could find".</i> Woo and his men stayed behind to talk to the police, saying they'd come right after to the hospital, while Helen and Jake went with their son in the ambulance, and Daria, Jane, Quinn, and Sandi took the Morgendorffer's blue Lexus and followed in <i>silence</i>, promising later to give statements to the police as well. Trent, Jesse, Max, and Nick stayed behind to give their statements, and would come to the hospital afterwards like Woo and his men. Helen called on her cell phone she took from the Lexus to her <i>mother</i> and <i>mother-in-law</i>, giving them the <i>gist</i> of what happened in the warehouses, and asked her mother to call <i>Amy</i> and <i>Rita</i> (and it would be <i>assumed</i> that <i>Erin</i> and <i>Brian</i> would tag along as well). Needless to say, both mothers were <i>beside</i> themselves and declared they'd be at the <i>Cedars of Lawndale</i> hospital within a matter of <i>hours</i>.</p> 

	<p>In the meantime, the police and Coast Guard had searched the inlet for William Appleton's body--<i>not</i> being able to <i>find</i> it. The <i>assumption</i> was that Darren's kick had knocked William <i>out</i>, and William had hit the water and <i>drowned</i>, and he was <i>washed</i> out to the ocean.</p>

     <p>It's been said that while good news travels <i>fast</i>, bad news travels even <i>faster</i>, and this bad news had traveled <i>so</i> fast, that when the ambulance had arrived at the hospital by the emergency entrance, the <i>media</i> and a large <i>crowd</i> were <i>waiting</i> for it. As Darren was taken out of the ambulance on a <i>stretcher</i>, news cameras began to roll, and pictures began to <i>flash</i>. Several reporters tried to come up shouting <i>questions</i> to a thoroughly <i>confused</i> and <i>angry</i> Helen and Jake, but hospital security began to hold them back. The blue Lexus pulled into the hospital's parking lot nearby. Daria and Jane <i>frowned</i> at the sight while they got out with Quinn and Sandi, and went into the emergency room past the throng of reporters and crowd.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Bitter sarcasm:)</i> Those damn <i>vultures</i>--they <i>already</i> know who Darren <i>really</i> is, Jane.</p> 

<p>JANE: <i>(Ditto, narrows eyes:)</i> Yeah--the <i>bastards</i> didn't waste any <i>time</i>, did they?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Puzzled with Sandi:)</i> Huh? Daria, what're you <i>talkin'</i> about? What do you <i>mean</i> "who Darren <i>really</i> is"? Why are all those <i>reporters</i> and people <i>out</i> there an' stuff?</p> 

<p>SANDI: Yeah, like, what's <i>going</i> on?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sighs:)</i> Well, you're gonna find out <i>anyway</i>, but let's hold off until <i>later</i>, okay? Right now, our first concern should be <i>Darren</i>.</p>


     <p>As the girls went into the waiting room, one of several on the first floor, they found that the <i>Griffins</i> were <i>already</i> there, with Linda and Tom sitting in the chairs, and Sam and Chris <i>wrestling</i> on the <i>floor</i>. When Linda saw her daughter, she <i>leapt</i> off her chair, ran over to her, and hugged a surprised Sandi <i>fiercely</i>. Tom Griffin got up and <i>reluctantly</i> patted his daughter on the back in a <i>reassuring</i> manner. Sam and Chris looked at their sister, <i>shrugged</i>, and <i>resumed</i> wrestling.</p>


<p>LINDA: <i>(Distraught:)</i> Oh, Sandi! Are you all right?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>Motherrrr</i>, like <i>how</i> did you <i>know</i> I was <i>here</i>? I was gonna <i>call</i> you!</p>

<p>LINDA: <i>(Raised eyebrows:)</i> You mean, no one's <i>told</i> you yet? Your <i>boyfriend</i> is <i>Arthur Appleton Jr.</i>, the mysterious <i>multibillionare</i> bachelor! <i>(Jane frowns at Linda's "boyfriend" statement, perplexed, while Daria rolls her eyes, and begins to <b>frown</b>)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Stunned:) WHAT</i>? My bro's <i>who</i>?</p>

<p>LINDA: <i>(Snorts:) You</i> didn't know about your brother, Quinn, Daria? <i>(Pauses:)</i> What kind of <i>bad</i> mother wouldn't tell her daughters that her son is--</p>


     <p>Daria <i>exploded</i> in a <i>rage</i>, walking right up into a shocked Linda Griffin's <i>face</i>.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>EXCUSE ME</i>, Mrs. Griffin, but my brother is fighting for his <i>life</i> right about now, and you're worried about something as <i>stupid</i> as about how much <i>money</i> he has?! Don't you think we ought to worry about whether or not that he'll <i>live</i>!? <i>(Pauses:)</i> I don't know about <i>you</i>, but I don't give a <i>damn</i> about how much money Darren has--<i>(looks at Quinn:)</i> and I don't think anyone <i>else</i> should, either! <i>(Leaves the waiting room in a <b>huff</b>, while Tom Griffin secretly <b>smirks</b>)</i></p>


     <p>The waiting room was full of stunned <i>silence</i> for a moment, then <i>Jane</i> spoke up.</p>


<p>JANE: Uh, Daria's having a <i>bad</i> night--like we <i>all</i> have had, you understand. I'll go and <i>find</i> her--excuse me. <i>(Leaves)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(<b>Scowls</b> a little at Mrs. Griffin:)</i> Um, I'm gonna go and find my parents, Sandi--see you later. <i>(Leaves)</i></p>

<p>LINDA: <i>(Begins to frown:)</i> What in the hell was all <i>THAT</i> about?! How <i>dare</i>--</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Cuts her mother off, frowns:) Mother</i>! Like, that was <i>sooo</i> not right! <i>(Frowns:)</i> An' for th' <i>record</i> an' stuff, I'm <i>not</i> Darren's girlfriend--<i>(pauses:)</i> that girl <i>Jane</i> is! <i>(Linda looks at Sandi, stunned)</i></p>


     <p>Daria went to the end of the building, an encased glass area of couches and chairs, and <i>slammed</i> herself into a couch. <i>At last, blessed silence</i>. Several minutes (or far <i>more</i>, she couldn't tell for sure) had past while she looked out into the now-late cloud-clearing nighttime sky, thinking. The <i>secret</i> of who Darren was was <i>officially</i> out now, but <i>so</i> what? Why in the <i>hell</i> did it matter about how much <i>money</i> he had to people so much? To Daria (and she suspected mostly to Quinn), Darren was the long-thought-of-dead big brother, nothing <i>more</i>, nothing <i>less</i>, and to Jane, a <i>boyfriend</i>--<i>period</i>.</p>

	<p>Now, he was a brother who was <i>fighting</i> for his <i>life</i>, a life she had only shared with him for about a <i>month</i>. Possibly one <i>month</i> to have gotten to know him, possibly only one <i>minute</i> to <i>lose</i> him. She looked down and shut her eyes in <i>pain</i>, determined not to cry anymore <i>tonight</i>--it was bad enough she had let <i>loose</i> at those <i>damn</i> warehouses--that short little <i>outburst</i> at Linda Griffin, while feeling <i>good</i> at the outset, did <i>not</i> alleviate her private <i>turmoil</i>. If Darren <i>dies</i>--</p>

     <p>Daria shook her head quickly, and <i>blasted</i> that thought out of her mind. <i>Hell no--don't think like that, Daria--he's not gonna die.</i> She found herself shivering without her jacket that she had used to stop her brother's <i>blood</i>, putting her arms around herself, privately wondering if it was the cold air of the <i>air conditioning</i> system, or out of her <i>festering</i> fury from lowering the <i>boom</i> on Mrs, Griffin. At that moment, she felt a <i>presence</i> behind her. Daria was not in the <i>mood</i>--if it was anyone <i>outside</i> of her family or Jane and Trent, they were going to get <i>another</i> dose of her <i>ass</i>. She turned around, <i>frowning</i>.</p>

     <p><i>Tom</i> was standing there with his jacket in his arms.</p>  


<p>DARIA: <i>(Surprised:) Tom</i>? Where'd you come from?</p>

<p>TOM: <i>(Smirks:)</i> I'd say I <i>dematerialized</i> out of nowhere, but I'll just say from out in the <i>hallway. (Daria smirks)</i> I happened to see you in here. I was about to leave you <i>alone</i> and find out how Jane was doing--<i>(pauses:)</i> but then I saw you without your <i>trademark</i> green jacket, and you looked like you were cold, so I came in here to <i>offer</i> you the <i>use</i> of mine.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Weak smile:)</i> Still think that's a <i>"second cape"</i>, I see. <i>(Shrugs, sighs:)</i> Ah, why the hell <i>not</i>? Sure, thanks. <i>(Tom puts his jacket on Daria's shoulders, sits down beside her on the couch)</i> I guess you heard about the news, too, huh?</p>

<p><i>(Note to reader: The "second cape" reference comes from the episode "I Loathe A Parade")</i></p>

<p>TOM: Yes--I couldn't help <i>but</i> to hear about it. It was on the local TV and radio stations--there are already <i>national</i>, and I've heard <i>international</i> news organizations are converging on our <i>proud</i> little community.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Snorts:)</i> What <i>Ms. Li</i> wouldn't <i>give</i> to get that sort of attention for her <i>Laaaawndale</i> High.</p>

<p>TOM: <i>(Grows serious:)</i> How's Darren?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks away:)</i> He--he was turning <i>pale</i> when they put him in the ambulance, Tom--I'm no <i>expert</i>, but I think he had lost a <i>lot</i> of blood. Jane and I had used our jackets to keep him from bleeding as <i>best</i> as we could, but--it might not <i>still</i> be enough.</p>

<p>TOM: <i>(Quietly:)</i> Daria--Darren strikes me a being a <i>strong</i> guy, not just <i>physically</i>, but <i>mentally</i> as well--he doesn't want to <i>leave</i> a family that he's just <i>found</i>. Don't give up--he's going to need your <i>strength</i> like he needs everyone else's.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looking tired:)</i> That's my <i>problem</i>, Tom--I-I don't know if I <i>have</i> any strength left.</p>


     <p>Tom hesitated for a moment, then slowly put his <i>hand</i> on Daria's, offering support. Daria grew <i>wide-eyed</i> for a moment, then relaxed, <i>slightly</i> red-faced.</p>


<p>TOM: Then I'll offer <i>my</i> strength for the <i>both</i> of us. <i>(Offers a quiet smile)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Thought v.o.: He's just gotten over Jane, and that's <b>it</b>, nothing more--<b>remember</b> that, Daria--he was being <b>nice</b> to you in that damn homecoming parade--so why in the hell am I getting that <b>same</b> feeling I had about <b>Trent</b>? Why do I feel <b>guilty</b>?)</i> Um, er, <i>thanks</i>, Tom.</p>

<p>TOM: You're <i>welcome</i>, Daria--<i>(pauses:)</i> uh, are you <i>hungary</i>? I could get you something from the hospital <i>cafeteria--(smirks:)</i> the food there is a <i>little</i> more <i>edible</i> than what they serve in the hospital <i>rooms</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks back:)</i> That's because the hospital room food is the actually the <i>leftover</i> food from the cafeteria. <i>(Thought v.o.: An <b>excuse</b>--get <b>rid</b> of Tom--<b>now</b>)</i> Yeah, now when I think about it, running around in the <i>rain</i> and surviving being <i>shot</i> has given me an <i>appetite</i>.</p>

<p>TOM: <i>(Gets up:)</i> Okay--anything in <i>particular</i>?</p> 

<p>DARIA: As long as it doesn't <i>move</i> on it's own, <i>anything</i>.</p>

<p>TOM: Gotcha--see you in a few. <i>(Leaves)</i></p>


     <p>Daria watched Tom leave, and breathed a <i>long</i> sigh of relief after a minute. She was about to sit down, when <i>Jane</i> showed up behind her.</p>


<p>JANE: Hey, <i>there</i> you are! I've been looking all over for you for an <i>hour</i>! <i>(Daria jumps) Whoa</i>, sorry!</p>

<p>DARIA: An <i>hour</i>? I've been gone for <i>that</i> long? <i>(Pauses:)</i> Uh, <i>how</i> long have you been there?</p>

<p>JANE: I just came in--I've been looking for you since you laid it on Sandi Griffin's <i>mommy</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Frowns:)</i> I <i>don't</i> feel <i>bad</i> about that, if that's what you think.</p>

<p>JANE: And you <i>shouldn't</i>, amiga. She had it coming <i>big</i> time. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I just ran into <i>Tom</i> in the hallway, and he told me you were in here while on his way to the <i>"barfeteria".</i></p>

<p>DARIA: Um, <i>yeah</i>--he came in to see how I was <i>doing</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:)</i> And he offered you his <i>jacket</i>, and is buying you <i>food</i>--how <i>sweet</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Off-guard a bit, frowns:)</i> What's <i>that</i> supposed to mean?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Taken aback:)</i> Huh? What do you <i>mean</i>? I was just saying that Tom could be <i>sweet</i> at times--just like <i>Darren</i>, that's all. He offered to buy <i>me</i> something to eat, but I wasn't hungary.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sighs:)</i> Sorry to <i>snap</i> at you like that, Jane--I'm just worried about Darren.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Quietly:)</i> Just as <i>I</i> am, amiga--it's okay.</p>


     <p>Just then, the hospital intercom came on.</p>


<p>INTERCOM: Would Helen, Jake, Quinn, and Daria Morgendorffer and a Jane Lane come to the <i>critical care ward</i>, please? Would Helen, Jake, Quinn, and Daria Morgendorffer and a Jane Lane come to the the critical care ward, please? <i>(Daria and Jane look at each other, turn pale)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to another waiting room, near the critical care ward, a minute <b>earlier</b>)</i></p>



     <p>After leaving Sandi, Quinn had found her parents, and had sat with them for a little more than an hour while awaiting the results of the surgery in silence, saying nothing about the shocking <i>revelation</i> of who her brother really was to them--it didn't seem *right* to do so, especially after seeing how Sandi's <i>mother</i> had gone on about it--to Quinn, in a rather <i>insensitive</i> way. She waited to see if her mother or father would bring up Darren's real identity--who was it again--<i>"Arthur Apple"</i>, or something--but apparently her parents had either <i>not</i> known yet about who Darren really was, or did not <i>care</i> at the moment given Darren's condition--and who could <i>blame</i> them? As for Quinn, she thought to herself about Darren. <i>Why</i> would he <i>pretend</i> he was someone else? Her <i>suspicions</i> were confirmed--Darren had money--<i>lots</i> of it by all accounts--and he was a <i>billionaire</i>! Quinn perked <i>up</i> for the briefest of moments when she thought about how much he had, then <i>frowned</i> to herself--what <i>good</i> would it do to think about something as <i>stupid</i> as money at this point? Her <i>brother</i> was fighting for his <i>life</i>, and she was wondering about his <i>wealth</i>? Quinn <i>berated</i> herself for thinking like <i>Mrs. Griffin</i>. She suddenly then considered Daria's reaction to Mrs. Griffin, and what Daria had said to Quinn herself--<i>"and I don't think anyone else should, either!"</i> What did her sister mean by <i>that</i> remark? She pondered about that silently to herself, frowning.</p>

     <p>Helen and Jake had talked to Dr. <i>Phillips</i> and several specialists about Darren while Darren was being operated on, and had offered to give their <i>own</i> blood. Dr. Phillips had said that it was <i>not</i> necessary, and that the hospital <i>had</i> Darren's blood type (A), and that Dr. Phillips would let them know as soon as possible about their son's condition in the <i>critical care ward</i>. Both had quietly went back into the waiting room, where they had seen Quinn sitting, but <i>not</i> Daria or Jane. Helen had considered both girls getting called over the <i>intercom</i> (she eventually asked for the staff to call Daria and Jane by it if they weren't around by the time an announcement was made over Darren's condition by Dr. Phillips), but decided that both probably wanted to deal with what had happened in <i>their</i> own ways--<i>especially</i> Daria. Helen was worried over how her middle daughter was taking this, after seeing her brother in such a state firsthand. At least Quinn was here--Helen could keep an <i>eye</i> out on her. Helen then looked over at <i>Jake</i>, who was looking off into space, and gently rubbed his back. He smiled and returned the favor by holding Helen close to him. They had <i>found</i> their son alive--now, they were close to <i>losing</i> him, all because of some--some--<i>kidnapping</i> over--some--<i>money</i>? <i>Is that what that masked <b>bastard</b> had said</i>? Helen remembered the <i>throng</i> of people and reporters that had greeted them when they came up--like a pack of <i>jackels</i>. Why in the <i>hell</i> would they come up like that? Granted, it was a <i>news</i> event of <i>some</i> sort, but to command so much <i>attention</i>? <i>Something doesn't seem <b>quite</b> right here</i>. Helen looked over to her youngest daughter, who seemed <i>deep</i> in thought--probably wondering if her brother was going to <i>live</i>. Helen spoke to her in a quiet tone.</p>


<p><i>(Note to reader: Dr. Phillips was seen in the episode "Ill")</i></p> 
 

<p>HELEN: Quinn, how are you doing, sweetie?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Sighs:)</i> I'm--okay, Mom.</p>

<p>HELEN: Well, that's good. <i>(Pauses, sighs:)</i> I wonder how Daria and Jane are doing?</p>

<p>QUINN: Well, Jane went after Daria, so they probably are together to keep each other company, an' stuff.</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Looks off again, sad tone:)</i> Yeah. <i>(Helen holds him next to her)</i></p>


     <p>The hospital intercom suddenly came on.</p>


<p>INTERCOM: Would Helen, Jake, Quinn, and Daria Morgendorffer and a Jane Lane come to the critical care ward, please? Would Helen, Jake, Quinn, and Daria Morgendorffer and a Jane Lane come to the critical care ward, please?</p>


     <p>It didn't take but a <i>minute</i> for Helen, Jake, and Quinn to rush over into the critical care ward where Dr. Phillips was waiting for them--he seemed to have a <i>neutral</i> look on his face. Jake was about to ask him Darren's condition, but Helen <i>cut</i> him off, wanting to wait for Daria and Jane, who came in a few minutes later. Daria had a <i>strained</i> look on her face, while Jane <i>shut</i> her eyes, and <i>cringed</i> as she waited for the news. Quinn looked about ready to <i>cry</i>, while Helen and Jake held each other, looking at the doctor with <i>expectant</i> looks on their faces. Dr. Phillips began.</p>


<p>DR. PHILLIPS: <i>(Begins to <b>smile</b>:)</i> He'll be <i>fine. (Everyone breaks out in a delighted cry, even Daria gives her patented Mona Lisa smile, closes her eyes in relief)</i> We we able to <i>stop</i> the bleeding and get blood back into him. Fortunately, the bullet went <i>all</i> the way through, and did not lodge into Darren's shoulder muscle, or any <i>bone</i>, for that matter. As a result, the wound was <i>smooth</i>, and we were able to deal with the damage to his shoulder muscle. It was good, however, that you did <i>stop</i> the bleeding, or it would've been <i>far</i> worse.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Cries out of joy, hugs an equally happy Jake:)</i> Oh, thank God! When can we <i>see</i> our son?</p>

<p>DR. PHILLIPS: He was <i>just</i> wheeled out of surgery, Mrs. Morgendorffer--I think you all should go <i>home</i> and get some <i>rest</i>--he won't be awake until the morning.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(So happy, she <b>hugs</b> Dr. Phillips:)</i> Oh, thank you, Dr. Phillips! <i>(Jake shakes his hand)</i></p>

<p>DR. PHILLIPS: <i>(Happy himself:)</i> It was my <i>pleasure</i>, Mr. and Mrs. Morgendorffer. We'll see you all tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Estatic:)</i> Well be here bright 'n early, Doc! <i>(Gives thumbs up:)</i> C'mon, gang--let's go home and rest--'course, I'm gonna be <i>so</i> excited, I might not be <i>able</i> to! <i>(Leaves with everyone into the hospital lobby)</i></p>


     <p>Jane closed her eyes, and gave a <i>large</i> sigh, then broke out into an <i>larger</i> grin. She was about to say something when Trent, Jesse, Nick, Max, and Woo and his men came into the hospital.</p>


<p>JANE: Trent! <i>(Runs over to hug him:)</i> They say Darren's gonna be <i>okay</i>! <i>(Voice grows quieter:)</i> But we won't be able to see him until tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Grins:)</i> Oh, man, that's <i>great</i>, Janey! <i>(Frowns:)</i> We didn't think the cops were <i>ever</i> gonna let us go with all their questions, then we waited for Woo and his men to finish being <i>drilled</i> so they could follow us here, not knowing where the hospital was, and when we got here, there was a <i>lot</i> of media and people outside--we had to be <i>escorted</i> in--<i>(smirks:)</i> kinda <i>cool</i>. Don't worry, sis--we'll be back here <i>first</i> thing in the morning.</p>

<p>WOO: As will <i>we</i>. Do you all know where a good hotel or motel are in the area where me and my men could stay for the night?</p>

<p>TRENT: Try the <i>Stopover Motel</i>, man--take highway seven south beside the hospital, and you'll be there in no time.</p>

<p>WOO: Thank you. <i>(Starts to leave with his men)</i></p>


     <p><i>Daria</i> and <i>Jane</i> stepped up. Helen, Jake, and Quinn watched on the side with the others.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Small, uncomfortable smile:)</i> Um, before you leave--Jane and I want to <i>thank</i> you for being there and helping out.</p>

<p>JANE: Yeah--if it wasn't for you guys--</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Smiles:)</i> --You're welcome, and it was our <i>job</i>, Jane--<i>(pauses:)</i> we--<i>I</i> owed him. <i>(Leroy and David look at each other knowingly, while leaving with Woo, and Daria and Jane look at each other and the others, perplexed for a moment)</i></p>


     <p>Daria and the others watched Woo and his men leave through the lobby and outside, where they were <i>swarmed</i> by a crowd of people. Helen and Jake looked at each other, baffled, then Helen looked at Daria, frowning, and confused with Jake for a moment, then spoke.</p>


<p>HELEN: Daria, do you know <i>what's</i> going on with that large crowd of people in front of the hospital? Why are there so many <i>damn</i> media types outside, and why in the <i>hell</i> did they come up to us when we got out of the ambulance with Darren? We didn't hear their <i>questions</i> too well, and Jake and I have been <i>wondering</i> what all of this is about!</p>

<p>JAKE: Yeah--<i>(grins:)</i> is it because they heard of the <i>Jake Morgendorffer Consulting Agency</i>? <i>(Helen and Quinn roll their eyes, while Daria and Jane smirk, and Trent and Mystik Spiral look at each other strangely--Jake then pauses, realizes something:)</i> Hey, Kiddo--<i>who's</i> jacket are you wearing?</p>


     <p>Daria's face turned <i>red</i> for the briefest of instances, something <i>Jane</i> picked up on, and <i>smirked</i> briefly--her <i>"Partner In Crime"</i> was <i>blushing</i>. Tom's <i>kindness</i> must've <i>embarassed</i> Daria once <i>again</i>--similar to that time after the <i>homecoming parade</i>.</p>


<p>DARIA: Um, <i>never</i> mind that now, Dad--I know <i>why</i> those <i>idiots</i> were out there, and--</p>


     <p><i>Tom</i> walked in the lobby with a bag of food, interrupting Daria, and the <i>Griffins</i> came behind him a second later into the lobby, and stopped with him with everyone else.</p>


<p>TOM: --<i>There</i> you are, Daria. I went to the critical care ward from the cafeteria when I heard you and Jane were called, but you were gone, and I thought I might have <i>missed</i> you--<i>here</i> you go. <i>(Hands her the bag:)</i> It's a couple of <i>cheeseburgers</i>--I figured your <i>family</i> might've wanted something to eat as well.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Red-faced again:)</i> Um, thanks, Tom--how much--</p>

<p>TOM: <i>(Holds his hand up:)</i> It's okay, Daria--with everything you and your family have gone through tonight--it's on the <i>house. (Pauses:)</i> So, how's Darren <i>Appleton</i>? Is he going to be all right?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Along with Jane looks over at her parents, who frown, confused:)</i> Uh, Tom, he's gonna be okay, but he needs his <i>rest</i>--we'll be back here tomorrow morning to see him.</p>

<p>TOM: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Great! Well, I'm going to go on--Daria, you can <i>keep</i> my jacket--I'll pick it up sometime tomorrow or Monday <i>(Daria turns red yet again, and Jane smirks yet again)</i>--see you all--goodnight. <i>(Leaves through a side door to get away from the crowd outside)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: Goodnight, Tom, and thank you again! Did he say Darren <i>"Appleton"</i>? That <i>can't</i> be right, Daria--Darren's last name is <i>Coverton</i>.</p>

<p>LINDA: <i>(Steps in, gives a quick <b>glare</b> at Daria, who <b>returns</b> it:)</i> Don't tell me <i>you</i> didn't know, Helen? Your son is the <i>multi-billionaire</i> Arthur Appleton, Jr.! It's all over the <i>airwaves</i>! <i>(Helen and Jake look stunned along with Trent and Mystik Spiral)</i> Sandi here <i>claims</i> that a <i>"Jane Lane"</i> is Darren's <i>boyfriend</i> for <i>some</i> reason, but <i>Sandi</i> is the <i>real</i> girlfriend of your son!</p>

<p>SANDI: But <i>Motherrr--(Quinn looks uncomfortable, slowly tries to slip off unoticed, but Daria sees her and <b>smirks</b>, saying nothing--it's all going to hit the <b>fan</b>.)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Cuts her off, angry:) --Hey</i>! Darren <i>is</i> my boyfriend--your daughter's <i>right</i>--where in the <i>hell</i> did you get the idea that Sandi Griffin is Darren's girlfriend? Okay, so I <i>let</i> him go with Sandi last night on that <i>damn</i> "date" with your daughter, <i>(Helen looks surprised with Jake)</i> but Daria and I were <i>watching</i> Darren and Sandi every step of the way! <i>(Now Helen and Jake look at a <b>red-faced</b> Daria and frown)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Thought v.o., sighs: Now it looks like what has hit the fan is gonna be spread out on <b>me</b>.)</i></p>

<p>LINDA: <i>(Glares:) "Let"</i>? Now <i>see</i> here, "Jane", is it? My Sandi <i>likes</i> Darren, or Arthur--<i>(Sandi turns red)</i> and she told me though it was part of a <i>deal</i> to keep <i>Quinn</i> in the Fashion Club, that she had developed <i>feelings</i> for him, <i>(Sandi turns even <b>redder</b>, embarassed)</i> and that those feelings were <i>real</i>! Even when Sandi <i>ran</i> into Quinn at that <i>Haven</i> place <i>last</i> night, it didn't <i>ruin</i> the date!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>WHAT</i>!? Quinn was at <i>Stacy's</i> last night for a slumber party! <i>(Looks around, then sees Quinn ready to sneak out of the side door:) QUINN</i>! <i>(Quinn winces, slowly turns around, then shuffles back to the group)</i> Is this <i>true</i>? Your father and I thought you were at <i>Stacy's</i> last night!</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Whines:)</i> But, <i>muh--oom</i>, I was just, um--</p>

<p>HELEN: --We'll speak about this <i>later</i>, young lady!</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>("Back-up":)</i> Yeah, <i>later</i>! <i>(Quinn rolls her eyes)</i></p>

<p>LINDA: <i>(Sneers:)</i> Can't keep them under <i>control</i>, eh, Helen? Well, I guess we'll all talk later--good bye--<i>(glares at Jane:)</i> Sandi can talk to <i>her</i> boyfriend then. <i>(Leaves with her family, and Jane <b>scowls</b> after them, Trent puts his hand on her shoulder to calm her down)</i></p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(While leaving:)</i> Um, <i>sorry</i>, Quinn, Jane--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Mutters:)</i> That <i>arrogant</i> witch! Now I know where Sandi <i>got</i> it from!</p>

<p>TRENT: Easy, Janey--<i>(realizes:)</i> um, is that why you guys couldn't come to our gig at <i>McGrundy's</i> last night? You had to watch Darren take this <i>"Sandi"</i> girl out on a <i>date</i> with <i>Daria</i>?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Sighs:)</i> Well, uh--it's a <i>long</i> story, Trent--I'll tell you on the way home. We'll see you guys tomorrow morning, okay? <i>(Leaves with Trent and the members of Mystik Spiral)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: Okay, see you then.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Scowls, hands on hips:)</i> Daria, <i>why</i> did you tell us that you were dating a <i>"Martin"</i> fellow when you were really with <i>Jane</i> and Quinn watching Darren date Sandi?</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>("Back up":)</i> Yeah, <i>why</i>? <i>(Helen glares at Jake)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Pauses, deadpan:)</i> Do you know how <i>weird</i> that just <i>sounded</i>, Mom? <i>(Sighs:)</i> Look, can we talk about this <i>later</i>? You wanted to know about <i>Darren</i>, remember? I'll tell you about it on our way <i>home</i>, okay?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(After a moment:)</i> Well, all right, and I'll call your grandmas and aunts on the way, and let them sleep <i>over</i> at our house tonight, and then we'll all come here tomorrow morning to see Darren.</p>


     <p>The Morgendorffers left the hospital, and ran into a <i>huge</i> crowd of cameras, reporters, and <i>questions</i>, ignoring them all, and had to be <i>escorted</i> to the Lexus, then off the parking lot by the police. On the way, after Helen had called their relatives, finding out that they found a hotel to stay at instead of sleeping over--(much to Daria's <i>secret</i> delight, save of course for her aunt Amy) Daria, while eating the cheeseburgers Tom had given her, explained why Darren had done what he had done, according to what Woo told her. Helen, Jake, and now Quinn were <i>stunned</i> beyond belief. Darren had tried to <i>protect</i> them from the murderers of his adopted parents--taking all of the <i>burden</i> for himself, and of the plane crash "accident". They barely had time to <i>react</i> to this news when they were greeted at their home by <i>another</i> large crowd of reporters and cameras in and around their <i>yard</i> and <i>driveway</i>. Jake was about to <i>lose</i> it, when the police yet <i>again</i> had to escort the Morgendorffers into their own home. Quinn had been <i>tempted</i> to try and get the <i>attention</i>, but a quick <i>glare</i> from Helen took care of that. The police offered to keep everyone off the Morgendorffer's lawn for the <i>night</i>, and Helen and Jake <i>gratefully</i> accepted the offer.</p>

     <p>When the Morgendorffers got inside, the phone answering machine was <i>bursting</i> with messages, and out of curiousity, Jake turned it on, hearing interview and <i>investment</i> offers from a variety of sources thanks to their knowing <i>Darren</i>--he was <i>considering</i> some of them, when Helen <i>screamed</i> at him to stop it, and took out the batteries from <i>all</i> the cell phones in the house--there had been <i>enough</i> calls for tonight--to Daria, in of itself an <i>ironic</i> thing to happen concerning her mother. There was a message for Daria from <i>Kevin</i>, who asked if Darren would <i>"give up"</i> his <i>"invisibility secret"</i> that Kevin believed had made Darren rich. Daria shook her head slowly at this, and went upstairs with Quinn--the time was <i>2:00 a.m.</i>. She stopped at Darren's room when she heard the cell phone in there ring. After pausing for a moment, Daria went in, and <i>answered</i> it.</p>


<p>DARIA: Um, hello?</p>

<p>VOICE: <i>(Frantic:)</i> Oh thank <i>God</i> someone <i>finally</i> answered! <i>(Pauses:)</i> W-who <i>is</i> this?</p>

<p>DARIA: This is Daria Morgendorffer, a <i>tired</i> teen-ager. Who is <i>this</i>?</p>

<p>VOICE: <i>(Surprised:)</i> Darren's <i>sister</i>? This is <i>Millie Appleton</i>, Darren's aunt! I'm calling from a <i>private jet</i> at <i>40,000</i> feet about my nephew's <i>condition</i>! I just tried to call your hospital, but the lines were <i>jammed</i>! I-Is Darren--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Now more alert, gently cuts her off:)</i> It's okay, Ms. Cov--Appleton--your nephew's gonna be <i>okay</i>--he came out of surgery with <i>flying colors</i>.</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Sobs:)</i> Thank God! I'm on my way <i>there</i>, and I'll arrive in this <i>"Lawndale"</i> by <i>7:00 a.m.</i> Sunday, your time--and please call me <i>Millie</i>, okay? I'm going to call Darren's friend <i>Curtis</i>, and tell him the <i>wonderful</i> news, and the staff at the <i>mansion</i>! <i>(Pauses:)</i> I haven't reached his <i>uncle</i> yet, but I'm still trying to <i>contact</i> him at his <i>apartment</i>--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Turns pale:)</i> Uh, <i>excuse</i> me, but you didn't <i>hear</i> about, um--</p>

<p>MILLIE: Hear about <i>what</i>, Daria? I was flying on my way home when my pilot told me of hearing something about a <i>report</i> that my nephew had been <i>shot</i>, but we were <i>cut off</i> before the <i>entire</i> report could be broadcast--something my pilot called <i>"magnetic sunspot interference"</i> up here that <i>disrupted</i> our radio and <i>TV</i> broadcasts, even my <i>laptop</i> computor. We <i>just</i> got it back--the <i>phone</i> part, that is. <i>(Gets excited:)</i> I'm sure <i>William</i> will be <i>delighted</i> that Darren's all right, Daria!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Thought v.o.: I seriously <b>doubt</b> that.)</i> Uh--Millie, about your <i>brother</i>, um--</p>

<p>MILLIE: --Yes, dear?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Bites her lip:)</i> --Maybe--maybe he's <i>already</i> heard that Darren's okay, and is <i>asleep</i>. Perhaps you should <i>wait</i> until you've <i>seen</i> Darren before you <i>talk</i> to him, and for that matter, your uh, <i>"staff"</i> at the um, <i>"mansion"</i>? They're probably <i>asleep</i> as well, having haerd the good news as well, the <i>same</i> for Darren's friend <i>Curtis</i>. In fact, maybe <i>you</i> should get some sleep like <i>I'm</i> gonna do.</p>

<p>MILLIE: Oh, I'm <i>sorry</i>, dear--do-do you know <i>what</i> happened? Was it an <i>accident</i>, or something? Did anyone <i>else</i> get hurt?</p>

<p>DARIA: Uhh--<i>something</i> like that, and uh, I can say of a <i>certainty</i> that no one else was <i>hurt (Thought v.o.: But <b>died</b> instead). (Yawns for real:)</i> Uh, if you don't <i>mind</i>, Millie, I'm gonna get that sleep. I'll see you at the hospital tomorrow morning, okay?</p>

<p>MILLIE: Of course, Daria--and you're <i>right</i>--I <i>need</i> my sleep if I'm going to see my nephew. William will probably <i>be</i> there at the airport to meet me, anyway. It was nice talking to you--goodnight.</p>

<p>DARIA: Goodnight--see you then. <i>(Clicks off Darren's phone, and out of insurance, decides to take <b>out</b> the batteries in his phone to keep <b>others</b> from calling, following Helen's lead) (Thought v.o.: Best if <b>Darren</b> tells her tomorrow than if she finds out from anyone else.) (Goes into her room, changes into her "Mark Twain" pullover pajamas--considers writing about the days events in her "so-called" diary, and decides <b>not</b> to--at least for now, turns off light, goes to bed)</i></p>


     <p>The following morning, after an surprisingly <i>uneventful</i> sleep, Helen was told by her mother <i>Evelyn</i> and mother-in-law <i>Ruth</i> that they'd be waiting at the hospital for them with <i>Amy, Rita, Erin</i>, and <i>Brian</i>. Jane had also called, telling Daria the same thing. Daria had also told her family of Millie's phone call last night, which made Helen and Jake turn <i>pale</i> over what she'd hear from her nephew over this. After everyone had cleaned up and had gotten ready, they went out, and were promptly greeted by another <i>throng</i> of reporters and cameras while being escorted by the police to their car, this time the SUV. PO'd, Daria had been seriously considering giving the press the <i>"bird"</i>, but decided to go with her <i>better</i> judgement--these people <i>weren't</i> worth it.</p>

     <p>Once again, the crowd was <i>huge</i> at the Cedars of Lawndale hospital as the Morgendorffers got out of their car, and the police and hospital security had to slip them in. When they got into the lobby, their relatives were there along with Jane and Trent, Woo and his men, and Millie Appleton, a red-haired, <i>attractive</i> woman, who had explained that she had just gotten in only <i>minutes</i> before the Morgendorffers, slipping in <i>unobserved</i>. Daria sighed to herself in relief--Darren could break the news to her himself. Then, an <i>argument</i> broke out over <i>who</i> should see Darren first outside his <i>immediate</i> family among Evelyn and Ruth--an <i>angry</i> Amy intervened and said that <i>both</i> grandmothers could go in after the family. Daria asked if <i>Millie</i> could go in first, and Helen and Jake, after hearing what Daria had said this morning about her call, quickly <i>agreed</i>, much to the <i>shock</i> of both grandmothers, whom Helen pulled to the side privately to explain why.</p>

     <p>Darren had been awoke from his sleep for about an <i>hour</i>, and he looked over at his left shoulder--it was badaged heavily, and in pain. Dr. Phillips had talked to him about his injury, and said that he would <i>not</i> be able to use the shoulder for at least <i>three</i> weeks--no weights--he sighed to himself--at least he was <i>alive</i>, and he couldn't <i>complain</i> about that.</p>

     <p>But alive unto <i>what</i>? Darren was informed by Dr. Phillips and the TV about what happened last night--it had been like some sort of <i>dull</i> nightmare. Darren laid back unto his pillow, thinking--the secret was <i>out</i>--he had <i>lied</i> to his birth family and <i>everyone</i> around here, even if it was to <i>protect</i> them. Would they <i>forgive</i> him? He noticed that the door to his room began to <i>open</i>, and <i>Millie</i> came in. He gave a <i>wide</i> grin when he saw her, which she more than returned in kind.</p>


<p>MILLIE: <i>(Begins to cry:) Darren</i>! <i>(Rushes over, gingerly hugs him:)</i> Thank God you're okay! How-how are you <i>doing</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: I'm <i>tired</i>, of course, and my shoulder <i>hurts</i>, though the <i>pain-killers</i> the doctors have prescribed to me have done the trick in <i>numbing</i> the pain. Say, I'm kind of <i>surprised</i> that my birth family let <i>you</i> in <i>first</i>, not that I'm <i>complaining</i>, mind you.</p>

<p>MILLIE: I think they considered my <i>travel</i> here when I heard what happened to you, and gave me a wide <i>lattitude</i> in seeing you. <i>(Grows quiet:)</i> How-how did you get like <i>this</i>, Darren?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Turns pale:)</i> You mean--you mean, you <i>don't</i> know? I thought for sure--</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Waves him off, smirks:)</i> --It's quite an <i>interesting</i> story, nephew, involving <i>sunspots</i>--remind me to tell you <i>later. (Grows serious:)</i> Now, how did you get like <i>this</i>? <i>(Frowns, perplexed:)</i> And for <i>that</i> matter, where is your <i>uncle William</i>? He should've been here right about <i>now</i>!</p>


     <p>Darren <i>grimaced</i>, and looked down, then back up at his aunt, looking <i>distraught</i>. Millie cocked her head at him inquisitively, caressing his face.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Gathers the courage to speak:)</i> Aunt Millie, there's something I have to <i>tell</i> you about what happened--and it <i>involves</i> uncle Will--and what happened with my <i>parent's</i> crash--</p>



     <p>Daria, Helen, Jake, and Quinn were down the hallway from Darren's room, waiting next to see him while sitting in some chairs. Helen, sitting beside Daria, leaned over and spoke to her in a quiet tone of voice.</p>


<p>HELEN: Sweetie, do you think we did the <i>right</i> thing in doing this? Perhaps we should've told Millie <i>ourselves</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: No, Mom--I think Darren would probably want to tell her <i>himself</i>--it's gonna be a <i>huge</i> shock to her to have lost <i>another</i> brother, and even <i>worse</i>, hearing that her <i>nephew</i> had to do the <i>deed</i> to protect <i>us</i>--</p>


     <p>The next instant, there was a wild, sobbing <i>scream</i> from Darren's room, a scream that <i>resonated</i> throughout the hallway. Quinn grabbed her father, scared, while Helen, out of a sense of <i>caring</i>, got up, and went <i>into</i> Darren's room to help <i>console</i> the now-grieving Millie Appleton, along with <i>several</i> orderlies. Daria watched, seemingly <i>impassive</i> on the outside, but <i>sadly</i> on the <i>inside</i>. Death itself is <i>never</i> a pleasant experience, but having someone you <i>love</i> carry out the <i>act</i> is even <i>more</i> of a tragedy. <i>Damn it, bro--haven't you been through <b>enough</b> already</i>?</p>

     <p>After several minutes, Millie had been taken to <i>another</i> room, under <i>sedation</i>, with the orderlies <i>assuring</i> Darren that she'd be all right. The Morgendorffers came into the room, and after the customary hugs and kisses, Darren reluctantly spoke.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Quiet tone:)</i> Please don't <i>interrupt</i> me until I'm finished, okay? I'm <i>sorry</i> for all of the <i>lies</i>. I should have just told you all who I was the first time you all met me. You might've <i>thought</i> I didn't tell you out of <i>protecting</i> you, but that wasn't the case at <i>first</i>. I didn't tell you because like an <i>idiot</i>, I followed my <i>uncle's</i> advice, and deliberately <i>hid</i> my past, only pausing enough to give you all <i>half-truths</i>, and <i>half-lies</i>. You took me <i>immediately</i> into your home with <i>no</i> questions asked, which <i>alone</i> should have told me of your <i>decency</i> and <i>honesty</i>. Instead, I <i>continued</i> to <i>lie</i> to you, occasionally building up the <i>courage</i> to tell you who I really was, but like a <i>coward</i>, backing off in the <i>end</i>--not that I didn't <i>try</i> to tell you. As you now know, I then found out about what had <i>really</i> happened to <i>my--(hesitates:) parents</i>, and, following Woo's advice, had to <i>continue</i> to keep you in the <i>dark</i>--you don't--you don't know <i>how</i> much I wanted to <i>tell</i> you--I mean <i>really</i> wanted to tell you--<i>(Helen, Jake, and Quinn look like they want to <b>cry</b>, while Daria looks at her brother with a slight look of <b>compassion</b>)</i> and I just <i>couldn't. (Looks at Quinn:)</i> Quinn, I told you to tell the <i>truth</i> about Daria being your <i>sister</i>, but I couldn't tell you all the truth about my <i>real</i> identity, and in that, I was a <i>hypocrite</i>. I'm sorry for that. <i>(Quinn gives him a weak smile, then Darren looks at Daria:)</i> Daria, I know honesty is <i>tantamount</i> to your <i>life</i>, and I <i>violated</i> that, and I'm sorry. <i>(Looks down, snorts bitterly:)</i> Some <i>"protection"</i>--it nearly got you all <i>killed</i>. I can only hope you all can <i>forgive</i> me for what I did.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Before anyone else can speak:)</i> Bro, <i>listen</i>, and listen <i>good</i>, because I'm only gonna say this <i>once</i>--you weren't <i>perfect</i>, but here's some <i>"shocking"</i> news--<i>none</i> of us are. Okay, so you didn't tell us <i>right</i> off the bat that you were <i>"Arthur Appleton Jr."--<b>big damn hairy deal</b></i>. My--uh, <i>our</i> parents didn't tell us about what they thought was a <i>miscarriage</i> for <i>20</i> years, and Quinn and I <i>forgave</i> them, and we can forgive <i>you</i> for about a <i>month</i> of these so-called <i>"lies"</i>. Oh, and in between these <i>"lies"</i>, you did what--saved Jane's <i>life</i>, actually brought some <i>sanity</i> to our family <i>(Helen, Jake, and Quinn look at her funny)</i>, helped Quinn with her studies <i>(Quinn nods)</i>, uh, <i>"bonded"</i> with <i>each</i> of us in one way or another, and saved me and Jane's lives while getting <i>shot</i> and fighting for your life in the process. All of this on <i>top</i> of having an uncle who plotted and schemed to <i>eliminate</i> you behind the scenes, having done it already to your--<i>parents</i>, and <i>manipulate</i> the company's inner workings. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Oh, and your trying to <i>"protect"</i> us didn't almost <i>kill</i> us--it was your <i>damn</i> uncle who did that. These things, I might add, make your <i>"so-called"</i> lies look like little <i>fibs</i>. Bro, I think I can safely speak for everyone in this room when I say that you're <i>forgiven</i>, and <i>then</i> some.</p>

<p>DARREN: But--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Soft giggle:) Hush</i>, bro--<i>(looks at Daria, smirks:)</i> I can say that this is the <i>first</i> time I <i>completely</i> agree with my sis on <i>everything</i>, an' stuff. <i>(Daria looks surprised)</i> Th' only thing I care about is that you're <i>alive</i>--I don't care <i>how</i> much money you've got. <i>(Helen suddenly reaches over and <b>feels</b> Quinn's forehead, while Daria takes her pulse, which makes Darren laugh)</i> What are you guys doin'?</p>

<p>DARIA: Trying to understand if the heat hasn't affected your <i>brain</i>--what <i>little</i> of it that's <i>left</i>. Our bro's <i>loaded</i>, and you're not gonna <i>charm</i> him into giving you a <i>dime</i>?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Gasps:)</i> Daria!</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Snorts:) Daaaria</i>! Why should I <i>care</i> about how much money Darren's got--<i>(looks at Darren, shrugs, indifferent:) what--</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smirks:) --10 billion dollars--</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>--10 billion dollars</i>, Daria! <i>See</i>? I'm <i>not</i> affected in the <i>least</i> by Darren's <i>wealth</i>! <i>(Thought v.o.: OHMYGODOHMYGODOHMYGOD!)</i></p>


     <p>There suddenly was a <i>sound</i> in the room, like a <i>thump</i>. Daria, Helen, Quinn, and Darren looked down on the floor, and saw <i>Jake</i> sprawled out, having <i>fainted</i>.</p>


<p>HELEN: <i>JAKE</i>! <i>(Goes over with Quinn to help Jake up in a chair)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan, smirks:)</i> So noted, sis--it looks like Dad <i>was</i>, though. Better get the <i>smelling salts</i>. <i>(Pauses:)</i> At least we know it wasn't the <i>ether</I> that made him faint <i>this</i> time. <i>(Helen gives her a quick glare while Daria leans over to a snickering Darren, in a <b>low</b> voice:)</i> Bro, there's something <i>else</i> I gotta <i>ask</i> you--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Senses Daria wants to confide something to him, leans closer:)</i> --Yes, Daria?</p>

<p>DARIA: Were you the <i>"Mysterious Benefactor"</i> for Mystik Spiral?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles:) Yes</i>, I was.</p>

<p>DARIA: You didn't <i>know</i> Jane or Trent at the time--<i>why</i> did you <i>help</i> Trent and the guys?</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Raised eyebrows:)</i> Why, isn't it <i>obvious</i>, Daria? I did it for <i>you (Daria looks shocked)</i>--other than the fact that I wanted to use my money to help out somebody.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Still stunned:)</i> You-did-that-for-<i>me</i>? <i>Why?</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Uh--because you're my <i>sister</i>? <i>(Daria smirks) (Looks over to a now-recovering Jake:)</i> Ah, is he okay?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Pats Jake on the back gently:)</i> He'll be fine, Darren.</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Mutters, in a daze:) 10 billion bucks--</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> Anyway--I wanted to ask you all if you and Jane, and Trent and the others can <i>come</i> to the <i>mansion</i> where I live after everything settles down in a few <i>weeks. (Quinn's eyes light up, gasps)</i> I'd like to introduce you to <i>my</i> world. The mansion my aunt and I live in sits on <i>450</i> acres of land by a large <i>lake</i>, is about <i>12,000</i> square feet, with <i>18</i> bedrooms, and <i>15</i> bathrooms--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> --Quinn will have a <i>ball</i> with those bathrooms--we may <i>never</i> see her again. <i>(Quinn rolls her eyes at Daria)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> --Anyway, we also have a <i>huge</i> study of books for <i>you</i>, Daria--<i>(Daria cocks an intrigued eyebrow)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Smirks:)</i> --And we'll <i>never</i> see Daria again--<i>(Daria now rolls her eyes)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: We also have horse <i>stables</i>, and a <i>helipad</i>--one can have <i>absolute</i> silence on the estate--something I think <i>Jane</i> would appreciate when she paints.</p> 

<p>HELEN: <i>(Smiles, laughs:)</i> You don't have to roll out the <i>red</i> carpet for us, sweetie!</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Has now recovered somewhat:)</i> Yeah, Big Guy! We're <i>just</i> your <i>family</i>!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Arched eyebrow, grins:) "Just"</i> my family? Well, I intend to treat my <i>"family"</i> to a <i>good</i> time, so get <i>used</i> to it! You've been <i>warned</i>.</p> 

<p>DARIA: And who, pray tell, are <i>we</i> to say <i>no</i>? I know <i>Jane</i> will <i>jump</i> on your offer, bro.</p>

<p>DARREN: Good--Quinn, you can bring your <i>Fashion Club</i> friends, if you want.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Gasps, excited, runs over and gingerly hugs her bro:)</i> Oh, <i>thank you</i>, Darren! I'm sure they'll wanna go!</p>

<p>DARIA: There go the <i>rest</i> of the bathrooms.</p>

<p>HELEM: Well, now that we've gone through all of that, I know there are some <i>other</i> people who want to see you as well, Darren--I'll bring up everyone else after checking on your aunt Millie. <i>(Leaves)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Thanks. Speaking of checking up on people, I'd better call my friend <i>Curtis</i>--he must be <i>beside</i> himself by now. <i>(Is handed the phone by Quinn, who dials the numbers that Darren tells her)</i></p>


     <p>The next several days consisted of visits (particularly the <i>"fun"</i> ones by <i>Jane</i>), phone calls, and an <i>exclusive</i> interview with <i>Meg Rosata</i>, with Darren issuing out an <i>apology</i> to all of Lawndale for what he had done. Darren had also called an <i>emergency</i> meeting of the Board and the stockholders via a special monitor system from his hospital bed--after careful consideration, he had chosen a stunned <i>Constance Waters</i> (much to the delight of an equally stunned Daria) to become the new Chair(wo)man of Appleton Industries. When asked by some members as to <i>why</i> he chose Constance, Darren had said it was a <i>"important decision he made after taking into consideration something that a person who is becoming more and more important in my life had said to me"</i>, which made Daria turn red-faced, and Jane <i>snicker</i> with delight. Constance also announced that <i>Leonard Potter</i> would be reinstated as head legal council of Appleton Industries. Leonard also agreed to be the <i>personal</i> lawyer to Darren, much like he was to Arthur Sr. and Lucille.</p>

     <p>The shoulder had healed properly enough to where Darren could get up, and make his decision to go <i>back</i> to the mansion and finish recuperating there, much to the chagrin of the Morgendorffers and Jane, but Darren said he wanted to "prepare" for the visit of his family and friends. Millie had gone on ahead to the mansion--rather <i>subdued</i>, Darren had noticed--and for <i>good</i> reason--she had lost <i>two</i> brothers. He confided to Jane and Daria that he would spend some <i>time</i> with his aunt when he got back to the mansion.</p>

     <p>As for <i>Woo</i> and his men, they were given <i>generous</i> bonuses for their work by Darren. <i>So</i> generous, that Woo proclaimed a <i>two</i> week vacation for <i>everyone</i> in his detective agency. Woo also agreed to be on <i>permanent</i> retainer for Darren, in case Darren needed him in the future.</p>

     <p>The time would come for Darren to <i>leave</i> for the mansion, and before he did, he told Daria to expect the top-of-the-line <i>Sharpshooter</i> computor system in a few days to replace her <i>old</i> system. Daria was <i>stunned</i> to get this top of the line system, but accepted it because Darren <i>insisted</i> on it, having gotten Quinn the <i>Circa Orginal</i> dress. On the side, he had ordered special <i>camel hair</i> brushes for Jane, who promptly painted a "farewell" portrait for Darren--for the <i>time</i>, at least.</p> 
 
     <p>Darren had been chauffered with the Morgendorffers and Jane and Trent to the airport via a rented <i>limousine</i> courtesy of Darren--much to Trent's <i>delight</i>--the limo would take them back from the airport after Darren left. He got out of the limo with the others and went up to the private plane.</p>


<p>HELEN: <i>(Softly hugs her son, sobs:)</i> We'll see you in a few <i>weeks</i>, Darren--you take care of that shoulder, son.</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Ditto:)</i> Yeah, Big Guy--you gotta have it ready for our <i>golf</i> outing, right? <i>(Darren nods)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Hugs her brother, who kisses her on the cheek:)</i> Now, bro, we gotta go to those <i>exclusive</i> designer shops while in New York City--Sandi and the rest of th' Fashion Club are Lookin' <i>forward</i> to doin' that--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> --And of <i>eating</i> up <i>"The Big Apple"</i> and leaving a <i>core</i> for us all. <i>(Quinn gives her a quick glare)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Don't worry, sis--we can do all those things.</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Shakes Darren's hand:)</i> Hey, man--we <i>owe</i> you for the <i>money</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: Trent--you guys in Mystik Spiral have to <i>follow</i> your dreams and <i>make</i> them happen--that's how you'll pay <i>me</i> back--don't sit <i>back</i> and <i>wait</i> for them to happen, because if you <i>try</i> that, you'll <i>never</i> reach your goal.</p>


     <p>Jane walked up to Darren with a <i>wicked</i> smirk.</p> 


<p>JANE: See you in a <i>few</i>, Darren.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Returns it:) Likewise</i>, Jane. I'll call, of course. <i>(Both begin to kiss each other deeply)</i></p>

   
     <p>About <i>two</i> minutes later, and after a rather--<i>uncomfortable</i> waiting period by everyone involved, Darren and Jane <i>finally</i> stopped kissing, then Darren got onto the plane. Daria motioned to everyone for a moment.</p>


<p>DARIA: Um, I forgot to <i>give</i> something to Darren--be right back. <i>(Goes up on plane)</i></p>


     <p>Darren had sat down in his seat when he saw Daria come up.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Slightly concerned, gets up:)</i> Something <i>wrong</i>, sis?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Red-faced, smirks:)</i> Bro, I <i>forgot</i> to give you something--promise me you won't go <i>spreading</i> it around.</p>

<p>DARREN: What, Daria?</p>


     <p>Daria looked around quickly, seeing no one, then quietly walked up to her brother and gave him a gentle <i>hug</i>. Unlike the previous one she had given him following finding out they were brother and sister, this was a <i>genuine</i>, more <i>comfortable</i> one. Darren hugged his sister as best as he could with the awkward dressing on his shoulder, then <i>kissed</i> a red-faced and surprised Daria gently on the forehead.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Softly:)</i> See you in a few weeks, sis.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Make sure you have that <i>study</i> ready for me to <i>devour</i>, bro--I'm getting a <i>hankering</i> for some reading.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Grins:)</i> It'll be ready, I promise.</p> 


     <p>Daria came out of the plane and went back with the others. The plane's doors shut, and everyone watched the plane begin to taxi on the runway, then when cleared to go, began to build up speed, and took off. After about a minute, everyone got back into the limo, and it drove off.</p> 


<p>DARIA: Damn it, I miss him <i>already</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Sighs:) Tell</i> me about it, amiga.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Looks down:)</i> Yeah.</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Frowns:)</i> DAMNIT!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Hooks her arm with his:)</i> Now, Jakey--he'll still <i>call</i> us, and everything will be fine! It's only a couple of <i>weeks</i> before we'll see him again!</p> 

<p>JANE: Trent, what do you--</p>


     <p>Trent was <i>asleep</i> on the limo's seat with his head tilted back, snoring.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> I guess he's <i>"thinking"</i> again.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Ditto:)</i> Then methinks my bro thinks <i>too</i> much. <i>(Pauses:)</i> You know, Daria--you can't say that this has been a <i>boring</i> summer now, can you?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> If I <i>wanted</i> to, I <i>could</i>, Jane--but I'll settle for <i>"mildly amusing"</i> instead. <i>(Jane smirks while the limo goes down the road)</i></p>




<p><i>Epilogue</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the Appleton estate, a few hours later)</i></p>



     <p>Darren sat down beside the <i>graves</i> of his dead parents, in the cool and softly breezy summer afternoon among the delicious trees and oaks, and began to speak:</p>


<p>DARREN: Mom, dad--I want to tell you that I've found <i>another</i> family--my <i>birth</i> family. I want you two to know that I'll <i>always</i> be an Appleton, but I'll have a little bit of <i>Morgendorffer</i> in me as well. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I'm <i>sorry</i> about <i>uncle Will</i>, mom, dad, and what he did to <i>you</i>--I'll do what I can to help aunt Millie through all of this--I know she kind of still feels <i>threatened</i> by the Morgendorffers, and we'll have to work <i>through</i> that. <i>(Smiles:)</i> I have a new <i>girlfriend</i>--her name's <i>Jane Lane</i>. You'd <i>like</i> her--she's a little more <i>open</i> than Stephanie was. I think she'll like the peace and serenity of the estate where she could <i>paint</i> without any <i>distractions</i>. I hope my--<i>new</i> family will <i>enjoy</i> themselves here, as well. I want to thank you both for being <i>there</i> for me in my life, and I'll try to live up to both of your <i>expectations</i>, I <i>promise</i>.</p>



     <p>Darren got up from the site, and quietly strolled back to the mansion.</p> 





        <blockquote><p align=center><i><u><h2>THE END...</h2></u></i></blockquote>




<p>For <i>now</i>, that is. I plan on possibly doing (much shorter) stories (or follow ups) in my own time, based on what happens after Season Four, and possibly after the TV movie (or before, I'm not quite sure)--if the demand is there, mind you. There are still <i>soooo</i> many loose ends after this story, am I right? Oh well, anyway, I hope you all enjoyed this fic, possibly the <i>longest</i> 'Daria' fanfic of all time. What you've read was the culmination of about <i>ten</i> months of work, starting during the "Drought" of Season Three. All of this simply came from an idea that kept going on in my head--I then jotted down a quick outline, some new characters, and went off--just like that. There weren't too many stories that I saw that had a bona-fide full-blooded sibling for Our Heroine, so why not give her and Quinn one, in this case, an older (lost) brother? I originally had Jane fall for Darren (and vice-versa) right off after she came back from her vacation, but then the 'Daria' writers threw me for a loop when <i>Tom</i> was introduced, and I seriously thought about <i>gutting</i> the whole thing, but then I decided that I had started this story, so why not see it out to the end? As I kept writing, I felt a little awkward as I saw how Season Four was going concerning how Tom and Jane were getting along--but thanks to Kara Wild's essay about the canon approach, I kept going. Then lo and behold, "I Loathe A Parade" came up, and new ideas flowed in my head! Believe or not (and I wouldn't blame you if you <i>didn't</i> believe me), the story plot just kind of fed itself throughout. I stayed away from jotting down scenes on a paper, then typing it on the screen, oh no--that isn't <i>my</i> style. I just allowed the story to <i>come about</i> in my mind, and I typed it down. Hey--if it didn't work, I <i>deleted</i> it, and went with something else! We've got the technical know-how to do it, so why <i>not</i> do it that way? (For me, anyhow.) There were times that I became <i>stuck</i> with where to go--(writer's block), so when that happened, I simply stopped doing it, and walked away to cool my mind, and do something else. A good lesson to learn, by the way--never <i>force</i> the writing--simply go with the flow. I had a <i>fantastic</i> beta-reader (who will be thanked in a second) that helped to point out some scenes that I could have added or taken out. All in all, it was a good learning experience, and I hoped that you truly enjoyed it, I really do. I know that there were not the customary commercials and songs that you're used to seeing, but I was simply trying to tell a <i>story</i>--nothing more, nothing less--I'll leave something like that to the expert 'Daria' writers.</p> 

<p>Time to thank some people.</p>

<p>I'd like to thank Diane <i>(Smoochy)</i> Long, Canadibrit, Crazy Nutso, John Takis, Kendra, J, Nemo Blank, the 'Daria' fanfic addict, Desanera, and the others who did so as well, encouraging me along the way.</p>

<p>But the one I hold out above everyone else here is one:</p> <h2><i><u>Kara Wild!</u></h2></i> <p>Take a bow (or curtsy), Kara! I want to thank you for beta-reading this mega-fanfic throughout the entire process, <i>your</i> encouragement, and of giving me permission to use some of your <i>"Driven Wild"</i> continuum, and of the characters. Your advice was invaluable.</p>

<p>I have some trivial questions that I'd like to ask you all for <u>fun</u>. Could you:</p>

<p>Spot any "Running Gags" in the story?</p>

<p>Figure out if any of the titles of the chapters have any double meanings?</p>
