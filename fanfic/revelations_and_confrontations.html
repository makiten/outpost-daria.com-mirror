<h1>Revelations and Confrontations </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The day that the FC later called “The Day of Fashion Infamy”
or TDFI, and Daria and Jane and quite a few others called “a hoot”, started as
a long, lazy, April Break day. Jane was at Casa Lane, sketching the more
particularly spectacular effects of air pollution in the upper layers of the
atmosphere, and Daria was privately wondering in her own room, whether or not
the atmosphere at the Lane house got too polluted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And where was the rest of Daria’s family? Why, the answer to
that question Daria neither knew nor cared-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ku-Winn, are you sure that there’s nobody home but your
geeky cousin?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-all right, now <i>that</i> was just wishful thinking. The
older Morgendorffers were at their corresponding places of work, and Daria’s
younger sister, Quinn, was holding a Fashion Club court downstairs, to Daria’s
greater irritancy. “Why can’t the earth just open-up and swallow them whole?”
she grumbled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Gee, Ku-Winn, it was so <i>not</i> nice of you to invite us
home and not have anything to eat,” Sandi said sarcastically.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Quinn is sorry, Sandi, aren’t you?” Stacy squeaked, looking
like she wanted the earth to open whole and swallow both Quinn <i>and</i> her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No food… that’s right… no food – no fat!” Tiffany added.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sandi, who was preparing to speak herself, choked on whatever
she wanted to say to Quinn, and instead turned to Tiffany with a compact mirror
in her hand. “Tiffany, look! A reflective surface! Run along and play with it
for a while!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ooh! Shiny!” Tiffany spoke, fiddling with the mirror like a
monkey. “Hey! A solar speckle!” she said excitedly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn stared. “How long she was like that?” she asked Stacy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Shouldn’t her parents be told, or something?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Absolutely not,” Sandi re-attached herself to the
conversation. “We got your lack of food to discuss.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But Sandi, we wouldn't eat it anyways!” Stacy protested.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s the point! Ku-Winn was supposed to have the food so
that we didn't eat it and demonstrated our will-power!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“To who?” Quinn asked, curious, but keeping half an eye on
Tiffany and Tiffany’s new toy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Um… how about that geeky cousin of yours?” Sandi finally
said. “She looks like she could use a few good tips from Tiffany! She’s, like,
too fat for height, or something!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“…Or something!” came from downstairs, and Daria groaned. Ye
gods, didn’t this quartet shut-up? Well, maybe it was more of a trio, since
Tiffany tended to speak about eight to ten words on an hour, and at least four
of them would be “Am I too fat?” – or something along similar lines. But the
others – God – they never shut-up! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria looked thoughtful, and looked at the wall. The latter
just not-stared back, as walls are wont to do, because that’s what they are,
even ones with the name of ‘Thomas’ written on them. “On one hand,” Daria
started to speak to ‘Thomas’, “this is my sister and her friends downstairs and
at least one of them is may be mentally deficient. On the other hand – I really
don’t want to hear what they’re talking about, either. So-“ Not waiting for
‘Thomas’ reply, Daria walked over to the door into her room and closed it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s better!” she said. “Now nobody is going to bother me
in my domain!” Then she looked around her room, and added, more quietly. “Maybe
I should invade somebody else’s domain instead.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Back at Casa Lane, Jane Lane was getting increasingly aggravated.
“No, no, and <i>that</i>’s not right at all!” she exclaimed, angrily, stomping
around her room like a crazed rhino. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey Janey, what’s up?” her brother Trent appeared in the
door-way, looking half-asleep, even though it was closer to noon than to
sunrise proper by now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don't you have a nap sometime around now?” Jane grouchily
snapped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To her surprise, Trent nodded wisely and walked over to <i>her</i>
bed, yawning so hard, that Jane expected his jawbones to unhinge like a
snake’s. That fascination caused a delay of a realization in Jane’s brain, that
on <i>her</i> bed lay several draft canvasses, left to dry-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>SPLAT! “Zzzz!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane’s mouth formed an ‘O’. For several minutes Jane tried
to say something, anything, that would convey as to how she felt at that moment
and failed to accomplish this even by a long shot. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, after several moments of impersonating a fish out
of water, Jane gave up, turned around in a military style and walked out of her
room <i>and</i> out of the house, going in no particular direction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At that point in time, Jane Lane really wished that Upchuck
with his “Feisty!” get-up line would be around. She would really enjoy tearing
him apart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so, whilst Jane Lane has started on her March of Doom
down the Lawndale streets, Stacy Rowe was experiencing a totally different
feeling, one that was as familiar to her, as frustration was for Jane, and
aggravation to Daria. It was panic. Stacy Rowe was afraid because Sandi and
Quinn were fighting, and Tiffany… was, well, Tiffany – not a good
state-of-matter to be, as even Stacy would agree. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then again, the Morgendorffer living room downstairs seemed
to be cutting pretty close to Tiffany-verse from Stacy’s P.O.V at least. As it
has been mentioned before, Sandi and Quinn were fighting verbally, Sandi doing
her “primadonna” routine, and Quinn using logic. If this was fighting, Sandi
would be swinging big blows, and Quinn would be jabbing short ones. And since
both girls were (obviously) in the same weight category, neither party did much
damage to each other, not even to their respective egos – after all, this <i>was</i>
a lazy day, slightly foggy and misty and damp, but otherwise quite okay. And
thus, if the fourth FC member was anybody <i>but </i>Stacy Rowe, the “meek
mouse” of the FC, nothing would’ve happened that was going to happen in the
future.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But this <i>was</i> Stacy Rowe the “Scaredy-Cat”, and so,
quite naturally (or <i>unnaturally</i>, this <i>was</i> the Fashion Club, after
all, the almost-epitome of all that was sick and sad in this world, at least
according to Daria and Jane), she was becoming almost as scared as a hobbit
locked in a same cave with a dragon – or at least an horde of goblins.
Consequently, of course, she panicked. True, it wasn’t a loud type of panic,
the same type that a chicken experiences when a farmer goes after it with an
axe in his hand, intent of making serving it with noodles as a side-dish, but a
quiet one, which meant that she was merely breathing heavily into one of sofa
cushions, looking at the other three with wide eyes. But because in the school
of LH only Brittany Taylor the head-cheerleader had actually bigger eyes than
Stacy, nobody noticed it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stacy looked-on… Tiffany Blum-Deckler was trying to catch
the solar speckles that appeared due to some angles between her compact mirror
and the sun outside. It was hopeless, of course, for as soon as Tiffany got
either between the sun and the mirror, or the mirror and whatever shiny surface
that the mirror ‘broadcasted’ the sun’s reflection, the speckle would vanish
from existence, but that was okay. Tiffany didn't get it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Meanwhile, Sandi Griffin and Quinn Morgendorffer had lost
too much steam to continue talking. They just sat in opposite corners, and
glared. ‘Oh my God!’ this caused Stacy to think. ‘Sandi and Quinn just may
decide to disintegrate the Fashion Club right then and there! They're so upset
at each other, and Tiffany doesn’t help matters much either – I got to do something!
Hey! Maybe Quinn’s parents <i>do</i> have some food! I'll go and check it out!’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>…Both Quinn and Sandi were pretty surprised when Stacy Rowe
got off the sofa and ran into the kitchen. Sandi opened her mouth to comment,
but-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey! The spot is getting warm!” Tiffany spoke suddenly. During
her hunt for the ‘elusive’ solar speckle she had somehow figured-out that the
speckle, the mirror, and the sun are connected somehow – in a stationary
arrangement (even though Tiffany didn't even know the word ‘Stationary’), and
so if the mirror doesn't move (even Tiffany knew that sun didn't move – the
planet earth did), the solar speckle stayed in the same place. And so, she
established the mirror in one place, assured that the speckle stayed in one and
the same place – a spot on the Morgendorffers’ floor carpet – and began to
lunge at it, hopelessly and without any results, for the reasons given above.
Since it was Tiffany though, she didn’t grow discouraged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Tiffany honey,” spoke Sandi, completely uninterested in Tiffany’s
pastimes. “You interrupted me again.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I'm sorry Sandi – you’re not fat,” Tiffany said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn blinked and stared at the other two, forgetting about
Stacy for the moment. At this moment in time, Sandi’s face looked nothing more
than a rather <i>overripe</i> tomato. “Tiffany,” she began to say, but
unfortunately she was interrupted now by Stacy, who also overheard Tiffany’s
latest niblet of wisdom (as far as Tiffany’s sayings went, that is), and
reacted in her usual wont – completely off the mark. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Uh Sandi, what Tiffany said you shouldn’t worry about your
weight, she didn't mean that she thought that you should be fatter – eep!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That “eep” resulted because Sandi gave Stacy a ‘look’ that
she had inherited from her mother. That look, executed by Linda Griffin, could
even stop fights-slash-rambles of Sam and Chris Griffin, Sandi’s younger
brothers, who had <i>much</i> more backbone than Stacy, who, upon seeing the
look from her friend and FC superior, fainted altogether, luckily – or not so –
not breaking the yellowish bottle she was holding in her hand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Maybe Daria is right – maybe our house needs to have a better
ventilation,” Jane muttered. “I <i>am</i> no longer as angry as I was before –
at Trent <i>or</i> at my muse. Still, I don't think I will paint again anytime
soon; I mean, facing the exasperation of-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Whoa there girl, slow down!” spoke another female voice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane whirled, around, startled, and stared. “Uh, who are <i>you</i>?”
she finally said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I, Jane, am your muse.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It would be an extreme unfairness to say that Jane Lane the
unflappable girl was so shocked, that she fell flat on her ass. No, it was
merely that a smooth pebble, slickened further by some residue morning dew was
caught under Jane’s foot, causing her to lose balance and fall flat on her ass
all the same. But… the latter version is much nicer to the Jane’s ego and
self-respect, so let’s stick with it, okay?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, at any rate, there Jane was, sitting flat on the grass
which was still wet and cold from residual morning dew, staring at a girl whose
make-up was seemingly done by Picasso, and her clothing was done
by-God-knows-who. In other words – this was Jane Lane’s art taste gone square.
In other words – Jane Lane was <i>awed</i>, and that was an understatement to
the least. “My… muse?” Jane finally said, unaware that the clothing on her
lower body was now soaked to the skin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yup.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ye gods, those art fumes have gotten to me by now!.. Why
are you here?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“To take a walk with you, and talk with you about in what direction
in art are you going to?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane slowly got-up. “This is not going to be fun, is it?”
she quietly said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don’t know – but let’s find-out!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“All right,” spoke Daria Morgendorffer, approaching the bedroom
of her sister Quinn. “Maybe I should’ve called Jane instead of naming my floor
David my other walls Frank, Liz and Marc, but this as an ounce of prevention to
counter the pound of cure is too bizarre!” She looked around. “Then again, I’m
having an <i>intelligent</i> discussion with myself. <i>This</i> is much <i>more</i>
uncomfortable, thank you very much!” She shook her head. “And I’m <i>arguing</i>
with myself, also. This settles it – I’m going in!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first realization that hit Daria’s neural centre – aka
the Brain – was ‘Pink’. Quinn’s whole room was pink. Also cherry, crimson, red,
cerise, and so forth, and so on. “Monochrome much?” Daria whispered darkly
under her nose, after her senses finally kicked-in their auxiliary emergency
repair energy jousts – and Daria needed. Quinn’s whole room reminded her of a
blazing bonfire or the innards of an exploding volcano – so full of hot colour
and energy her sister’s room was. “Hmm,” Daria scratched her head. “Wasn't Jane
once quoting one of her sisters, abut how a person’s taste in colours reflect a
person’s state of psyche?.. Mmm, Quinn maybe my sister, but I think I'll settle
with the idea that I'm the bizarre one in the family right now. And speaking of
right now, what <i>other</i> treasures this ‘Cave-of-40-thieves’ wannabe has to
offer?” Daria paused. “And God – I really need a life.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Absent-mindedly, Daria waved her arm around and hit a button.
A built-in closet door opened, and Daria’s eyes widened. “Oh God!” she had only
time to say before she fainted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Is she dead?” Tiffany briefly stopped hunting for the speckles.
That wouldn’t be important, if one doesn’t keep in mind Tiffany’s rather
bizarre attention span and its’ rather narrow angle of sight: as long as
anything is in it, Tiffany will have it in an endless re-run of her rather
small memory; but if it gets out of there, Tiffany will forget about it, if not
altogether, then for a <i>long</i> while. And sometimes it’s not as harmless as
it may seem…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No Tiffany, she’s not dead, she has fainted,” Sandi
spoke-up crossly. “Try to be even a <i>bit</i> observant, why don't you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What is she holding, then?” Tiffany pressed-on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I think it’s some sort of a fruit juice,” Quinn said,
shrugging. “I think some friends of my parents’ from college send those things
over to them every once in a while. I think Daria once tried it and claimed to
have holidays staying-over in her room, or something.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Really?” Sandi said, getting the bottle open, and a smell
spread through the air – a warm, pungent smell, smell of grapes growing and
fermenting right on the vine, of figs ripening on trees, of swarthy men
gathering dates of really tall palms… In short, it was a very <i>interesting</i>
smell, especially to four high school girls who have all-too-many-free-time on
their hands. “Holidays, eh?” Sandi spoke with a weird-yet-thoughtful expression
on her face. “Well now Ku-Winn, do you think that we should try it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Do bees buzz in the Lawndale Park?” Quinn replied rather
snappishly. “Want me to get glasses?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nah, my aunt Vicki can drink cognac right from the bottle’s
neck, and so can I,” Sandi said more confidently than she felt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This is why you’re the FC’S president,” Quinn replied. “Who
will be the first?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sandi’s face formed a rather malicious and nasty-looking
smirk. “Oh Tiffany!..”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trent Lane opened his eyes – his front hurt. “Uh! Did I fell
asleep or something Janey? Janey?..” No answer went back. “Hmm… Must’ve
gone-out or something. Oh well. Can get a whiz without needing her,” Trent
muttered and went to the bathroom of the Casa Lane, still clutching his guitar,
in a manner similar to Peanuts’ Linus holding his blanket, only without the
thumb in his mouth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It must be pointed-out at that point that the Lanes of Lawndale
didn’t fare all that good in matters of mirrors. The only actual mirror, made
out of glass, not a bowlful of water or an odd-job made out of some bronze
(done by Amanda Lane during her Oriental phase), was on a medical cabinet in
the same bathroom into which Trent Lane, still more than just half-sleepy, was
going into. Consequently, that mirror was located nearer to the ceiling than to
the floor, and thus was position around Trent’s upper torso and face, both of
which (plus his pants) were now coloured in paint that Trent had ‘borrowed’
from Jane’s painted drafts that lay on her bed. And so, when Trent Lane
turned-on the bathroom’s light (a single, small, very lonely, dim light bulb
glowing vaguely in the ceiling), what Trent saw was his reflection – but what
he actually thought (as a male musician you couldn't count on Trent to remember
such unimportant things as mirrors) he saw was a Papuan in full war paint, with
wildly dishevelled hair, and with eyes blood-shot from some inner anger. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Gah!” the musician bellowed bravely, swinging his guitar as
some sort of a club. If the blow had landed on the mirror, it would’ve
shattered it. However, Trent miscalculated and the blow slammed into the
cabinet’s side, jarring its’ door open, which immediately swung, due to the
residue force of Trent’s wild blow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hurk!” the opened door hit Trent directly in the right side
of his face (keep in mind that the Lanes’ bathroom was rather small), and Trent
promptly fell down and out – like a rock, that is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So uh, what do you want to talk about?” Jane Lane, the
younger sister of Trent asked her muse. At least, she supposed that if was her
muse. That theory was supported by the fact that no person – no matter how
insane – would dress into something that looked like an exploded – either fruit
salad or a macaw parrot. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why Jane, your art, of course!” the muse said, swinging her
arm. Jane, however, didn't notice that; her attention was too occupied with the
sight of the muse’s <i>sleeve</i>, very loose and transparent, swinging through
the air. “Hey! You're not paying attention!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sorry,” Jane said petulantly. “But can you change into some
other clothing get-up. Seeing you alone makes me want to start creating wildly,
and down with everything else – starting rodents and ending with other
countries.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How ‘bout leather pants and a corsage to match?” Jane suggested.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jan exhaled through her teeth. <i>Sharply”</i> “Just start talking
already!” she said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“As you wish.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a pause. “Well?” Jane said, feeling that that was
rather anticlimactic. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Look in the water.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane looked. “I see nothing but ripples. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Try to look harder, would you?” the muse suggested. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane did. And she didn’t like what she saw.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>The room was messy to the extreme – mayhaps even more
messier than Trent’s, even though that was hardly possible, and it </i>wasn’t <i>Trent’s
either. There were no signs of music sheets </i>or <i>instruments, but there
were plenty of artworks – if you could call them that. Rather, they were some
sorts of expressions of shapes and colours, bizarre and abstract to the max. <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>And then there was a figure standing in the middle of
this exploded cornucopia of mess and colour – a very thin figure, almost naked
save for some smock and a beret all dappled and drappled. A figure, who was
swinging a pint-brush – </i>wildly<i>. A figure, who suddenly turned-around and
stared at the ‘Real’ Jane Lane with blood-shot eyes stuck in an almost
skull-like face… of the same Jane.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>The vision ended.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stacy Rowe was falling – or rather, she was pushed. She was
pushed down through some deep dark tunnel by Sandi Griffin’s medusa-like stare
and she felt so alone – or was she?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What’s going-on here?” she heard a voice of Sandi Griffin,
and suddenly there was a burst of yellow light, and then-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was <i>everything</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Uf, where are we?” Quinn Morgendorffer exhaled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Good point,” Sandi agreed. “Tiffany, Stacy – you two here?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah,” Stacy nodded. “Both of us are here.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Good. Then here’s where?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Uh, Sandi – I think we’re still here, here being the Morgendorffers’
living room,” Stacy bubbled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“All right, this is weird,” Quinn blinked. “If here’s our
living room, then where’s the bottle? And the compact mirror with which Tiffany
was playing?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Tiffany?” Sandi said in a warning tone, “you didn't break
it and forget about it did you?” After all, there were precedents…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Tiffany shook her head. “No.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And then there’s some other, different stuff,” Quinn continued.
“Just look around, you guys: everything looks different, yellow<i>ier</i>,
older – you savvy?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Come on Quinn, that must be the drink talking,” Sandi said
uncomfortably. “I’m sure that this is just a trick of the light, that
everything looks the colour of <i>really old</i> newspapers.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“<span style='font-family:OldEnglish'>Is it</span>?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The four girls whirled around. “Who said that?” Sandi demanded.
“Show yourself.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“<span style='font-family:OldEnglish'>Gladly</span>.” And
out of thin air appeared… a biggest, most unpleasant-looking rattlesnake that
Quinn Morgendorffer had ever seen! And she used to live in Highland, Texas! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who or what are you?” Sandi, meanwhile, insisted. “You're
not a snake – snake can't talk!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“<span style='font-family:OldEnglish'>I am the shadows in
the night, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:OldEnglish'>I am the darkness
against the light.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:OldEnglish'>I am the lonely day
when friends aren’t near.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:OldEnglish'>I am frustration. I am
fear,</span>” the snake hissed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Fear? Humph! You don't look so scary!” Sandi insisted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“<span style='font-family:OldEnglish'>Oh I don’t</span>?”
the snake smiled. “<span style='font-family:OldEnglish'>Well, let me show you
your future - the future of the Fashion Club</span>!” and it maniacally
laughed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Bring it on!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so, while Jane was having an <i>eye-opening</i> experience
and the FC were about to confront Fear, what was Daria doing? Well, Daria
opened her eyes, and realized that she was in <i>Hell</i>. Wherever she looked,
all was red, or crimson, or scarlet, or ruby, or burgundy, or cherry, and so
on, and so forth. “This is either Hell or innards of a volcano <i>before</i> it
goes all Pompey on the neighbourhood,” Daria muttered. “Yo! Who’s owning this
joint? Show-up!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“<span style='font-family:OldEnglish'>There’s no need to
shout - I’m here</span>!” spoke a voice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria whirled around. And stared.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>The creature that appeared looked
like a cross between a human mannequin and an Oriental dragon. Its’ skin shone
like lacquer wood, and it was composed of two colours: red and black. “And
what, or who, are you?” Daria said slowly.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“<span style='font-family:OldEnglish'>I
am the monster under the bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:OldEnglish'>I
am all the worries inside your head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:OldEnglish'>I
am every drop of every tear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'><span style='font-family:OldEnglish'>I
am the fever. I am fear.</span>”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Daria frowned. “Fear, hah? Wait a
second – you mean you’re the anthropomorphic personification of it, yeah?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“<span style='font-family:OldEnglish'>What
if I am</span>?” Fear looked confused. “<span style='font-family:OldEnglish'>What
is it to you, then</span>?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Daria smirked. “See, I once had to
deal with a whole bunch of such personifications – only they were holidays.
Luckily for me, a couple of friends joined me on that trip – as in
alcohol-induced, that’s it. It means that mom and dad received another bottle of
fermented cactus juice and it’s been open…” Daria trailed-off. “Quinn! I've got
to talk to her.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Fear – whether real or
hallucinogenic jumped between Daria and the doorway. “<span style='font-family:
OldEnglish'>I don't think so missy, you’ll still have to confront me</span>!”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Oh yeah?” Daria frowned. “We're
going to see about that!”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Feeling braver that she looked,
Daria charged.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>BOOM!</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Eesh!” Jane Lane shook her head,
banishing the last vestiges of the vision from her eyes. “Is this supposed to
be me, turning recluse and completely art-driven?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Yes. Jane, extreme amount of art
never did anybody good.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“So what you’re saying? Should I
abandon art altogether?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>The muse rolled her eyes. “Take
another look.” And this time Jane wasn’t distracted by the sleeve – she looked
in the ripples right away.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'><i>“Mom, dad do we have to visit
your aunt?” the kids whined. Jane idly observed that both kids had black hair
and neither had glasses, though what that had to do with vision she sure as
Hell didn't know. What she noticed though, that the vision showed the anteroom
of a house that somehow seemed familiar – oh yes, Jane had seen it when the
annual Lane reunion was hold at aunt Bernice’s. So what?<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'><i>“Sister!” the man yelled, and
Jane couldn't quite see him or recognize his voice, though the latter seemed
familiar. “We're here! Say high to your kids.”<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'><i>“Hey kids,” and a stocky,
average, somewhat unpleasant-looking woman appeared in the doorway. The woman
resembled aunt Bernice but was somewhat younger, her hair was somewhat blacker.
“Say hello to your auntie Jane.”<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Uh! Where am I?” Daria grumbled,
rubbing her forehead. “What did I do – run into the wall?” She looked around.
“Uh, maybe I did. What is this place, anyways? Oh yeah – Quinn’s room.” </p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Daria paused, remembering. “Well,
the pain cleared-away all the hallucinations, but this – hey, do I smell smoke?
Quinn!” </p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Daria quickly – though unsteadily –
got on up on her feet and ran downstairs, suddenly very concerned for her
sister’s, and her sister’s friends, welfare. </p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>…“Bring it on!” Sandi had yelled
and the world exploded in rain of tongues of yellowish flame. And the rain
fell, the four FC girls changed…</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“What has happened?” Stacy asked,
suddenly feeling confused. “I don’t feel different, guys… Guys? Guys? Guys?!
Where are you??”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“<span style='font-family:OldEnglish'>Somewhere
else</span>,” the girl then heard the hiss of Fear. “<span style='font-family:
OldEnglish'>The Fashion Club is no more - it fallen apart! You all went your
separate paths and forgot about each other; except for Tiffany, who’s quite <i>another</i>
story. How’s that for Happily-Ever-After, hmm</span>?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“No!” Stacy yelled very loudly.
“No!!”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Hey, where am I?” Quinn looked
around. “This is weird. This is so weird. This is Daria’s room – what does it
have to do with me?” She paused. “Wait a second, something’s wrong. Why does
Daria has my smiling-face pillow nailed to the wall, and why her photo has her
hair dyed…”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Quinn’s voice trailed-off. That was
no photo. That was mirror. And staring from the mirror was a tad perkier, a tad
slimmer, and a tad less stocky image of Daria with somewhat reddish hair. “That
can’t be me,” Quinn shook her head stubbornly. “I'm not a socially-skilled,
mentally retarded version of my sister!”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“<span style='font-family:OldEnglish'>Is’t
so</span>?” Quinn heard Fear’s voice hiss. “<span style='font-family:OldEnglish'>Blood
is thicker than water, and as for DNA... your sister may become you, but you
may become your sister! Isn't it ironic</span>?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Aaah!” </p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Ouch, my head! I think I've landed
on something <b>hard</b>!” Sandi Griffin groaned. An echoing groan came from
some distance away from her. “Who’s there?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Sandi?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Tiffany?” the other girl’s voice
sounded different, but Sandi couldn't figure out how – the place was now even
dimlier lit than before, and there were no signs of either Quinn or Stacy.
“What’s going on? Wait, you couldn't know-“</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>And then the chamber lit-up, and
Sandi and Tiffany saw each other, reflected in a mirror. </p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Sandi saw Tiffany first: a chubby,
overweight woman with slightly blurred facial features. Tiffany’s eyes looked
especially small in her face that resembled a well-oiled pancake. Sandi smirked
– and then saw her older self, a woman with hair tied in a horse-tale, her own
features – both facial and bodily again large, though nowhere as bad as
Tiffany’s, but large all the same. </p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“<span style='font-family:OldEnglish'>That
is your futures</span>,” Sandi heard Fear hiss. “<span style='font-family:OldEnglish'>Two
overweight housewives with no skills and no careers. What do you say now, Sandi
Griffin? Who's laughing now</span>?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Tiffany did. “You're funny,” she
said to her reflection. “Who are you?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“It’s <u style='text-underline:
words'>yourself</u>, Tiffany,” Sandi snapped – and so did the right-hand
reflection. “It’s your own future!”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Tiffany fainted.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Okay, now I'm confused,” Jane
turned to the muse. “What is your point <i>exactly</i>?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“My point exactly – gods, sometimes
you can be so dense – that you should learn to moderate, girl, your art and
your life!”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“I do! I'm a straight C student!”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“And you think you’re going to
succeed in life with it?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“You're not saying that I should be
like Allison, sleeping with whoever she needs to get advanced in the world?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Jane! Listen to me: what do you
do: live to paint, or paint to live?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Isn't it kind of similar? Option
one makes painting the only worthwhile pastime in my life. Option two makes
painting the only reason for me to live.” Jane paused. “Got to admit, neither
sounds that great an option.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Then perhaps you should put your
painting aside and concentrate on other topics – like turning that C average to
a B?” the muse suggested. </p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“You know?” Jane frowned. “For a
muse you’re pretty discouraging.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“You know,” the muse said back,
“for somebody quite intelligent, you can be so self-destructive.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Aren't artists supposed to be
self-destructive?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Aren't you supposed to have your
own identity?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Jane froze, looking as if somebody
stuffed a working tazer stick up her arse. “Let’s try again,” she said.
“You're… worried that I might destroy my life for art?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“But… it’s want I want to do!”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“But is it the right thing to do?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Jane froze. “You haven’t been
talking to Daria, have you?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“No, I've been talking to <i>her</i>
muse – she got one of her own: a writer, not an artist, but a good girl all the
same.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Mm. Got to meet her one day.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Not if you’ll be dead or so
wrapped-up in art,” the muse said. </p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Jane sighed. “All right. You’ve
proved your point. I'll go and talk to Daria about changing my lifestyle.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“You do that,” the muse said.
“It’ll be much better for you.” Then – she vanished.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Jane was left alone on the bridge
over the Lawndale stream (a tributary of the Merrimack river) that ran through
the town. </p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“That was weird,” she shook her
head. </p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Then she heard the sirens of
Lawndale’s fire department. Curious, she followed their sound.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“What has happened here?”</p>

‘warmed-up’ a patch on our carpet, and it started smoking. If it wasn't for me
dismantling the whole thing and getting everyone into fresh air outside – who

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Yes, fresh air,” Jane nodded
wisely. “It’s a very good thing. Speaking of it, Daria, can you tutor me for a
change of our social table? I had… a revelation, sort-of.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Daria arched an eyebrow. “Something
I should be aware of?” </p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Let’s just say that maybe I've
inhaling paint fumes. Or something. But back to this tutoring thing. Will you

eyes. “What has happened?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Smoke and alcohol poisoning young
lady, that’s what!” Helen Morgendorffer, Quinn’s mother, spoke sternly. “How
could you and your friends drink something that you didn't know what it was?
It- It could’ve been rat poison, or paint remover or something!”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Mom, I've got to call-“</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Fear? I'll show you fear!” Helen

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Had a similar experience too,”
Daria shrugged. “With Jane and Trent along for the ride. You got lucky. And
Quinn?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Yeah?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“What’s with the pink setting?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“I like pink,” Quinn said
defensively. “You got a problem with that?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“No,” Daria shook her head. “Any
other questions?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“N… Y… N… Daria, did you hear
anything just now?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Hah? <i>You</i> heard something?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Actually, Quinn did. She heard – or
thought she heard – a semi-familiar hiss by now: “<span style='font-family:
OldEnglish'>I'm not a friend. I am fear. I'll be back</span>,” but that was
ridiculous. Fear wasn't real, it had been just a combination of strange alcohol
and smoke. </p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Quinn shook her head. “No. Good
night Daria.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Good night Quinn.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Daria left and Quinn fell asleep,
and neither saw how in the shadows of Quinn’s dressing table some<i>thing</i>
re-hissed “<span style='font-family:OldEnglish'>I'm not a friend. I am fear.
I'll be back</span>,” and vanished. </p>
