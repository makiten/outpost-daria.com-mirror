<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>This</i>, Danielle Todds
thought, looking up at the dark sky that pulsed with an incoming shower of tens
of thousands of tiny meteors burning up in the atmosphere, <i>is easily one of
the most beautiful worlds that I've ever set foot upon. Thank God the locals
were able to deal with the problems themselves.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She looked up into the sky at
one of the binary stars that the world circled, a brilliant spotlight billions
of miles away. Danielle remembered from the briefing that the stars were actual
cosmic twins, as both were 'G' class stars &ndash; one slightly further away than
Earth was from the sun, and it orbited the main star as the planets did. <i>It's
the same distance out Jupiter is from Earth &ndash; or in that '2010' movie, the star
Jupiter turned into.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Danielle's dark eyes took in
the view &ndash; the distant star-sun, two of the three moons of this planet (also a
twin, it's sister world a sea-green jewel low on the horizon now, tilted so
that the eternal belt of clouds over its equator, several thousand miles across
and miles thick, was visible), and the huge shimmering sets of planetary rings
that circled the world in a direct alignment with its magnetic axis and created
a nighttime spectacle that drew even the Ringbearers &ndash;some slightly jaded by
all that they had experienced &ndash; out every night to just sit and look at its
beauty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Ashley loves staring at the
Rings of Light, too."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The Ringbearer always smiled
when she heard the name for the planet's rings, as did every Ringbearer when
they first heard it. "Hello, Spaulding," she said, reaching down and feeling
warn, soft fur beneath her fingers that she began to stroke gently, feeling a
gentle shudder of pleasure. "Couldn't find anyone else to rub your neck?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She turned her head, and looked
down to see the small Northern Fur Seal seated on his haunches besides the rock
she sat on, his snow-white fur unusually clean and shining. <i>Even with
everything that I've seen &ndash; finding out that Douglas Adams was right still
rocks me back on occasion. Not just with the dolphins, but with more than a few
of the citizens of the sea. Who knew fur seals were that intelligent, had their
ways to move off Earth, or had settled on other worlds in our own reality, but
over to others? They're almost as far up the chain as the mice!</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The expression on the seal's
face turned upwards in what could only be interpreted as a smile, and Danielle
scowled as she removed her hand. "I'm <i>sorry</i>-!" Spaulding Michaelson Seal
pouted, his words clear in Danielle's mind. "I don't mean to do it, but it's
just that you were thinking, and it was such a nice thought-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"It's impolite to read
someone's thoughts. Just talk, all right? Well, you know what I mean."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Psychic fur seals &ndash; complete
with telepathy, a touch of telekinesis and mental bolts that can stun a blue
whale in his tracks &ndash; and all they want to do, for the most part, is 'enjoy the
Seal Experience.' That is something no one expected &ndash; a philosophy dedicated to
living an easy life. Adams really called that one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"The <i>Starbears</i> said that
they'd talk to you guys tomorrow about their decision."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Oh, okay. Thank you,
Spaulding."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Can I say here with you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Danielle smiled at the eager
eyes of the seal, almost wiggling with happiness. "Yes, you can stay with me."
She slid down from the rock upon the soft, fragrant grass and let the fur seal
snuggle approach, his fur warm against her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Spaulding nuzzled in close, his
eyes already misty with sleep. "Hey... you're warm like Mom... and Stepford... and
Ashley..." The young fur seal dozed off, and Danielle looked down at him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>Of all of the things that we
expected to find when we found this world and considered it as a perfect world
to place a Ringbearer base &ndash; a recreational facility, a major training academy
and a sustainer array for <u>Beacon Terra One</u> &ndash; no one imagined that the
world would not only be occupied, but by creatures who know about supernatural
menaces, but have the means to beat them back.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>The Effrani are just &ndash; wow.
Add to that, telepathic fur seals that emigrated here from Earth after they met
up with them and stopped a serious HST threat on their own &ndash; and now, they have
a population of thousands of fur seals... although this one has an annoying
tendency to steal the blankets.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Danielle waited until a soft
breeze wafted overhead, and held her Defender Ring up; she transmuted the air
into a thick, soft layer of <i>omnicloth</i> &ndash; an alchemically created fabric
that acted as an all-purpose material. It could be used to make clothes that
allowed the wearer to remain warm or cool as needed, was water- and corrosion
resistant, non-fading, and impervious to punctures, fire, tearing, or wear &ndash;
much like the garments worn of 'unstable molecules' worn by some metahumans &ndash; <i>like
the Legion,</i> she thought. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'>I hope that they don't hold a
grudge, and the Council did decide that particular Soul Crystal was safe in
their custody. We also did a 'reset', so no one in their Lawndale remembers
what happened &ndash; and by finding that major trans-temporal/special nexus at the
site of their old school, I'm out of the Council's doghouse. Apparently, the
classroom where that self-esteem class was taught was the location of the
single biggest stable non-transitable nexus anyone's ever encountered to date...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Danielle ran her fingers across
the soft cloth. It was the perfect material for use in the field by Ringbearers
&ndash; and there had been complaints about having to try to stay warm by using
layers and layers of silk &ndash; <i>yes, the locals might like it for trade, but
unless you're female and trying to seduce someone, silk wasn't that useful for
normal clothing, let alone tents or other uses.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>This is the first Corps-wide
endowment they've placed upon the Rings since I've worn one,</i> she thought,
creating a second large panel of the cloth after placing the first on the
ground; using her TK ability, she gently moved the seal onto the makeshift
sheet, and then pulled the second over herself and Spaulding. <i>Good thinking,
too</i>. <i>Omnicloth has many more uses out here, and once the locals see what
it can do, you can always get a deal for coats with hoods or socks made of
omnicloth for whatever you want. They'll take omnicloth over gold or diamonds.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>Funny. They <u>always</u>
want coats with hoods and socks.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Tucking Spaulding into his own
corner of the huge panel of cloth and smiling as he immediately began to twirl
himself into a warm little cocoon, Danielle concentrated on the passing winds,
creating several yards of thick, heavy silk cloth that she rolled into a firm
bundle. Moments later, she had created a second smaller panel of <i>omnicloth</i>
which she folded and sealed on three ends with her telekinesis. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>Nothing like TK to make
molecular bonds in the cloth - no visible seams, everything's snug and perfect,
and when the others see this tomorrow, I'll get someone to take my patrol shift
by promising to make them bedclothes for their beds, once we begin
construction. If they're nice &ndash; I just might make them a very nice four-post
bed. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The Ringbearer slid the
pillowcase perfectly over the thick bundle of silk. She held up the pillow
she'd created, smiled, and set it down behind her before pulling the cloth over
her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'>It's such a beautiful sky.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Danielle eased herself back and
her mind drifted off, the Rings of Light being replaced bys <span lang=EN
style='mso-bidi-font-size:7.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN'>the image of bouncy,
carrot-red hair floating through her mind as she stared off into the distance

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The group of seven Ringbearers
&ndash; Danielle, the leader because of her elemental affinity for Quintessence &ndash; had
set up a small meeting area in a clearing a good two miles away from the main
Effrani village, which was off limits to the Ringbearers, and located deep
within the huge, thick forest that covered the entire area as far as the eye
could see.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>Over the entire continent,</i>
she thought, recalling the flight in, <i>except for the rivers and lakes that
can be seen from overhead. North America used to be like this &ndash; and as far as
we're concerned, this will never be touched. There are five continents and two
serious archipelagos &ndash; the world's sixty-eight percent water &ndash; and we're asking
for permission to use land on the larger continent in the northern hemisphere
for the base and the array, and the archipelago on the equator for the
recreation facility. <o:p></o:p></i></p>

sent reps here for the past year to confirm the viability of this world and
we're friendly with them, this is the first time the Effrani have actually
allowed us to send people specifically for the purpose of negotiating the
rights to the lands. Wonder what they want?<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Danielle rolled her eyes,
shaking her head and ignoring the laughter of her fellows as Spaulding's head
popped out from behind a tree "Hey, Danni &ndash; your boyfriend's back," one of the
Ringbearers snickered, watching as the fur seal pup half-waddled,
half-levitated over to where they sat, moving fasted than any of them would have
thought possible. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Do you have vegetable stew?
The Starbears love their vegetable stew, and they eat fruits, and they used to
eat fish but they don't have any fish anymore, and that sucks because I want a
fish because when we moved here, we didn't get to have any more fish and I want
a fish <i><u>SO</u></i> badly because the stuff here's not bad but I'm a <i>fur

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>"Spaulding!"</i> Danielle's
olive complexion had taken on a reddish glow, her ears burning with the other
Ringbearers' roars of laughter as the seal's babbling (a rambling mish-mash of
psi-speech and eager barking) suddenly ceased. "I &ndash; we &ndash; if I give you
something to eat, will you promise to go home and play while we work with the
Effrani this morning?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Later, Danielle reflected on
her monumentally bad judgment at what to give Spaulding for a snack, wincing at
how the other Ringbearers' Ring-presented memories of her creating a large
platter of fresh tuna - and how she had to keep a flying fur seal pup (who
immediately locked onto the scent and leaped forward with wide eyes and an
ear-splitting psychic cry of 'FISH!') from knocking her down as he tried to get
to the tray &ndash; would probably be fodder for <i><u>decades</u></i> of laughter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Things got worse, she had to
admit, when less than a minute later, a swarm of hungry fur seals came flying
out of the forest in an aerial hunting formation, whiskers quivering as the
mental cries of <i>'where's the fish? where's the fish?</i> echoed loudly about
the area &ndash; and then, one of the fur seals caught a scent...</p>

for their collective seafood Jones."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I'm sorry &ndash; I haven't seen

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I will <i><u>never</u></i>
live this down." She looked around the meeting area, at the gathered thronging
of fur seals, barking happily as they ate from the huge mounds of fresh salmon
and tuna created from large chunks of ambrosia. "We'll have to ask the Effrani
if we can reschedule the meeting &ndash; because this place is trashed."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Perhaps not."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Danielle turned to the sound of
an incredibly pleasant baritone voice, and saw a soft, fuzzy face looking over
at her &ndash; the face of one of the Effrani Elders from the village. Behind him was
a group of four smaller Effrani, and all five wore robes made from
Ringbearer-gifted silk. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>'Starbears' is right - and
they do love the silk...</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The Effrani, put simply, looked
like grizzly bears &ndash; in this case, about five feet tall (very tall, considering
that the average Effrani was four feet tall) &ndash; and if bears spoke in Midwestern
English. She had adjusted to the seals talking that way because their telepathy
spoke directly to her mind, so that's just how she heard them &ndash; except for
particularly loquacious seals like Spaulding, who switched without warning
between telepathy and the normal seal-speech of barks and so forth. <i>If
there's one thing that makes this job so much easier, it's the translator
endowment on the Rings...</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Hello, Elder."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You are healed?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Danielle nodded. "One of my
friends saw to that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I see that you took no offense
in what happened." Danielle heard a sound that could only be the rumbling of stomachs,
and noticed that a couple of the Effrani kept glancing at the fish, and an idea
popped into her head... </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Elder &ndash; may I invite you and
your friends to have a meal with us? Spaulding told me earlier-" Before he and
his friends nearly knocked my block off. "-That you once had fish on this
world, but they're gone now."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Another loss from the Seasons
of Fear," the elder said, taking the offered seat at the only remaining table,
now moved some distance away from the original spot<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&ndash; the other tables had been trashed in the seal dive-bombing.
"The alien pathogen delivered to our world reduced our population to a third of
what it was &ndash; but before we were able to eliminate all of the infected Effrani,
they had caused such damage to the food chain that the various ocean fish are
almost gone &ndash; it's a rarity to find them, and the fish from our inland
waterways are gone now."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Danielle waved to one of the
other Ringbearers, who brought several blocks of ambrosia to the table on small
plates as two others set out huge containers of ice water and large bowls (the
Effrani, they knew, preferred to have bowls they could lift and drink from in
social settings around strangers). "This is the &ndash; <i>ambrosia</i> &ndash; that we've
heard of, yes?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The lead Ringbearer nodded. "If
you'll allow me..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The Effrani suddenly began
rumbling with excitement as Danielle passed her hand over one of the blocks of
ambrosia, and it transmuted into a massive metal tray, filled to the brim with
thick, freshly baked salmon fillets! "Elder, you know exactly when the
infection arrived on your world?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Yes," he said, looking down at
the serving of six large fillets set before him (the Ringbearer who elected
himself as server had a feeling that very large portions would be appreciated).
"Why do you ask?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"My superiors may be able to
help you, in terms of bringing back your native stocks of fish &ndash; and perhaps,
also adding new fish from other worlds. Of course, we would have to make sure
that any fish we bring in would find a place in the ecosystem without causing
damage. That's happened a number of times on my home planet."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You know about these things?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"My father was a farmer; I
spent the first sixteen years of my life on a farm helping to grow food," she
told them. "You end up learning about similar and related subjects to your work
&ndash; and one think I learned about was how transplanting certain species without
knowing how they'll interact with the environment can cause disaster. On my
world, the kudzu weed and the Asian carp are two examples of how things can go
badly very fast. We'll probably just help you repopulate your own breeds."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Danielle allowed herself to
talk longer than she usually would have; it let the Effrani have more time to
eat without feeling the need to reply. "If you enjoy that type of fish, we
could probably show you how to use one of your lakes in order to work with
breeds from other worlds, and breed your own without risking your own breeds.
You'll just have to take the appropriate precautions."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The Elder lifted his snout from
his plate and wiped it on a thick silk napkin before speaking. "You can help us
bring back the creatures that were once here?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"It's possible..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The Ringbearer noticed the
sudden quiet at the table; all of the Effrani were looking at her with
quivering snouts. "What?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Speaking slowly, as if choosing
every word very carefully, the Elder sat up straight at the table. "When the
pathogen appeared on our world-" The way the Effrani went from technobabble to
plain speech fascinated Danielle. "-One of the species destroyed was a type of
insect. They were widespread in many areas, particularly in the southern areas
on this continent, and particularly vulnerable to the pathogen &ndash; which simply
wiped them out by the billions."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The other Ringbearers paid
close attention to the fact that the fur seals had stopped eating, and listened
with a measure of annoyance on their adorable faces. "This species was
particularly valuable to us. It was a primary link in the plant life on our
world, assisting in the pollination of many, many forms of plants &ndash; and it also
produced a secretion which was both edible, and could be used for medicinal
purposes. The importance of this species cannot be understated, and if you and
your fellow Ringbearers could help restore them..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>An elfin-thin male Ringbearer,
who was aware of just how much he resembled the mythical race and played it up
in the way he carried himself, brushed his long, platinum-blond hair from his
eyes as he leaned in close to Danielle. "He can't be thinking-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Hey. Once you've been across
the actual <i>Rainbow Bridge</i> and stood at the gates of <i>Asgard</i>, not
to mention actually having the met the guy 'who created you' and discussing the
finer points of redheads with him over a pizza dinner-" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She looked up into the
Ringbearers' ice-blue eyes. "Read up on the '<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Gardener Principle'</i>. It'll rock you back. Anyway &ndash; after a while,
you have to just accept the weird and unusual."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Danielle turned back to the
Effrani. "Um... could you describe these insects?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"They're small &ndash; about an inch
long. They have black and yellow stripes, and make a buzzing sound when they
fly. They're named 'stingers', because of the small stinger each has-" The
Elder cocked his head to the side in a questioning manner that Danielle found
adorable. "You've seen them before."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The elfin Ringbearer's eyes met
Danielle's once again. "If they're talking about <i>bees</i>..."<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"They are," Danielle echoed,
transmuting a handful of grass into ambrosia &ndash; and then changing that into a
one-gallon container of honey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The Effrani locked their eyes
on the container in a way that reminded Danielle of the very first time she had
ever gone clubbing, and the way every guy (and more than a few women, which,
she later admitted, was an insane turn-on) simply couldn't stop staring at her.
<i>Yeah. That's the money.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>"Stinger's extract,"</i> the
Effrani all rumbled; only extreme self-control, Danielle noticed, kept them
from coming across the table at the container. "You have stingers on your
world."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"We call them 'bees' &ndash; but we
can discuss that later." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Danielle rose from the table
and walked about twenty meters away as the Effrani and her fellows watched; her
Ring was aglow as she transmuted the earth in a small area into water, creating
a wading pool big enough for the Effrani to frolic in. "Kerry."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Kerry &ndash; the elfin Ringbearer &ndash;
lifted his ring; in a flash, five pillars of rock rose up from the ground to
become makeshift altars, smoothing out to a glassy finish on top. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The other Ringbearers joined
in; within a minute, what could only be a small temple stood in the morning
sunlight; surrounded by a ring of tall trees, with massive containers of honey
and large, gleaming honeycombs sitting atop each altar. "A token of
appreciation, from the <i>Corps of Ringbearers</i>," Danielle said. "We'll
return later."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The seven Ringbearers
disappeared in tiny, rapidly disappearing points of darkness as they
transported to the Ringbearer vessel waiting on a small island seventy miles
away from the mainland; before they had vanished, the Effrani had flung
themselves towards the temple and the honey with a speed that would have made
cheetahs or velociraptors wince. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Three days later (after healing
several dozen Effrani of tummyaches, Danielle laughed to herself), the Effrani
had agreed to the terms of the agreement &ndash; with one additional provision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>There was no way that I was
going to let any other Ringbearer be around to witness this,</i> Danielle
thought, sighing gently as several Effrani poured warm honey over her naked
form &ndash; along with the circle of other Effrani Elders that knelt in front of the
large wading pool inside the Great Temple inside the main Effrani village. <i>Just
saying 'thank you' for giving them some honey would have been enough...<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The small Effrani padded all
around Danielle and the other Elders, stroking and rubbing the warmed honey
over every inch of their bodies before lifting them, one by one, to the wading
pool to bathe them. <i>You know &ndash; back on Earth, this kind of spa treatment
would set you back a few grand, and &ndash; oh, God! These furry guys have some
talented little paws...</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>As the Effrani lifted
Danielle's shining, nude form high in the air and moved slowly with her towards
the wading pool to bathe her, the Ringbearer reflected that being made an
honorary member of an Effrani life-clan wasn't such a bad thing, after all.</p>
