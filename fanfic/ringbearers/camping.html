<br>
<i><u>Camping</u><br>
<br>
A <u>Tales of the Ringbearers</u> mini-fic by Brother Grimace</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;You know, I'm so glad that the Ringmasters added a couple of minor mods
to the transfiguration ability,&quot; Jane Lane said, looking off in the
distance at <i>Mount Covenant</i> as she stood on the plateau of the <i>Devil's
Tower</i>. &quot;Makes camping on top of a mountain easier.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sure that's not what they were thinking about,&quot; Daria
Morgendorffer, looking in the other direction at <i>Enclave Peak</i>, <i>Mount
Covenant's</i> twin - both a good seven miles away from the Tower. It's so
strange, having two mountains that look so similar placed like they are... it's
almost as if they're built that way.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah - they are.&quot;<br>
<br>
The two girls turned as Robert Nelson stepped out of the small wooden structure
his <i>Defender Ring</i> had created earlier. &quot;When the Ringmasters
decided to expand the Corps, they found Nova Valdris and terraformed several
areas for special purposes - like here, in the Nicholl Nature Range. A couple
of thousand or so miles of untouched forest, waterways, and some really nice
mountains. Perfect for Ringbearer training - and a nice vacation spot.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The last time I went camping, my family ended up being airlifted out
after eating some of the wrong berries,&quot; Daria sighed. <br>
<br>
&quot;Not to worry, amiga,&quot; Jane smiled, looking down at the pot simmering
over a campfire. &quot;This time, dinner's on me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Robert grimaced as he saw the contents of the pot. <i>&quot;Swedish
meatballs?&quot;</i><br>
<br>
&quot;Daria glanced over at her boyfriend. &quot;You don't like them?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, I do - but you can get them anywhere... and I do mean <b>anywhere</b>,&quot;
Robert explained. &quot;One thing that I found out, being a Ringbearer, is that
every single alien race out there - well, every one that we've encountered - <i><u>has
the exact same dish</u></i>. They have different names for it... but as soon as
you see it, you know exactly what it is.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Really?&quot; Jane asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah - but I <b>wouldn't</b> ask around for it on Bovus Fourteen,&quot;
Robert grimaced, remembering that he still needed to get back at Renee for
telling him to do just that. Man, that girl holds a grudge. &quot;It's the same
as asking for 'long pig' in certain places back on Earth.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh,&quot; Daria said, moving away from the pot. &quot;Uh, Jane - could
you or Robert just whip up a pepperoni and sausage pizza for me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He can do it - I'm going to the little girls' room,&quot; Jane said,
smirking as she saw Robert motioning for her to disappear. &quot;Thank God they
put new additions to the transmutation endowment.&quot;<br>
<br>
Daria's ears perked up. &quot;Really? What did they add?&quot;<br>
<br>
Robert cut in. &quot;Copper, for one thing. Amber, feather water-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What's 'feather water?'&quot; Daria asked. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'll show you later,&quot; the young man smirked. &quot;They also added
chewing gum and honey-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I won't even ask,&quot; Daria said, shaking her head. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, the bears love it,&quot; Jane said. &quot;The honey, and chewing
gum. The <i>Ringmasters</i> also added paper to the list.&quot;<br>
<br>
Daria's nose wrinkled in confusion. <i>&quot;Paper?</i> Why paper - so people
can have things to write on?&quot;<br>
<br>
Jane and Robert both took on twin smirks. &quot;What?&quot; Daria asked,
growing slightly annoyed. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, yes... but that was the second thing that came to mind,&quot; Jane
said, barely keeping from laughing. <br>
<br>
&quot;Um, Daria... people got tired of using silk when they went to the
bathroom,&quot; Robert said, trying to put it as delicately as he could.
&quot;Paper's bio-degradable - and toilet paper is one of the best ice-breakers
there is in getting to know new people on a planet, or for people we've come to
rescue. It's always one of the things people miss the most in any crisis.&quot;<br>
<br>
Daria shook her head as Jane picked up a large rock, and transmuted it into a
roll of toilet paper. &quot;Umm,&quot; she said, ribbing her fingers against
the side of the roll. &quot;<i>Two-ply.</i> <b>Don't wait up.</b> <br>
<br>
Jane lifted herself into the air. &quot;Save some meatballs for me, Daria. We
all know what you're like... around meatballs.&quot;<br>
<br>
Robert made a valiant not to join in on Jane's tinkling laughter as she soared
upward and away from the top of the <i>Devil's Tower</i>, the rock Daria
throwing at her missing by a wide margin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stop that,&quot; Daria said, turning to him, &quot;You're turning
red.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry,&quot; he said, struggling not to laugh. <br>
<br>
&quot;In order to not kick you over the edge of this mountain, why don't you
tell me why there's an exact double of a mountain from Wyoming here on another
planet?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, to be honest,&quot; Robert said, going over to the pot of meatballs
and spooning out a serving for himself, &quot;it's because everyone likes the
look.&quot;<br>
<br>
Daria gave him a look laced with sarcasm. &quot;Wait a minute. You're saying
that, because a lot of people like the way a mountain looks, they made one just
like it on another planet?&quot;<br>
<br>
Robert shrugged. &quot;They had their original Citadel inside the <i>Devil's
Tower</i> on their Earth - and they figure that it's a symbol of peace. That
Spielberg film's big all across the universe. Hell of a comedy for most aliens.
Besides - it's a hell of a landmark. Anyone lost in the Nicholl Range can easily
find their way here and make their way down the river a couple of miles
south.&quot;<br>
<br>
Daria took his plate, and held up a rock. &quot;Thanks. You know, I could use
some bread.&quot;<br>
<br>
Robert's laughter echoed across the top of the Tower.<br>
<br>
