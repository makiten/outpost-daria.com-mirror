<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Robert's apartment held more
people than Daria had ever seen there before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>There was a somber tone in the
apartment, though, despite the huge, crystal punch bowl that sat in the middle
of the table on the side of the living room &ndash; which seemed a LOT larger than
before - or the piles of sandwiches on platters next to the bowl.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Hey," Robert said, rising from
the couch to take Daria in his arms and hold her close. "Missed you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Robert... I've only been gone an
hour." Daria relaxed in his embrace, and then looked up to see the stubble on
her boyfriend's face. "Where have you been? It looks as if you haven't shaved
in a couple of... <i>weeks?</i> What happened?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Show her."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria glanced over to the
couch; it was then that she confirmed that the apartment somehow seemed... <i>bigger</i>...
than it usually was, as there must have been at least fifty people comfortably
seated and meandering about, all turning as the man she knew as Archangel
spoke. "Go ahead," he repeated, accepting a glass of punch from a sleek, busty
young woman of Slavic appearance who, as Daria realized as she looked into the
woman's large, dark eyes, had to be far, far older. "Tell her. Better yet &ndash;
show her."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Robert turned to Daria, and she
felt a cold chill pass through her. "I &ndash; got a call &ndash; just after you left. An
emergency beacon went off, and they needed everyone they could get who wasn't
on a specific mission that couldn't be put off." Robert took Daria's hand in
his, and led her to an empty spot on a couch Daria knew wasn't there before she
left. "It was &ndash; it was-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>*****</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1 style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Near the California/Nevada border &ndash; an
alternate Earth in the Multiverse</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"There they are!" a hulking,
muscular Cuban Ringbearer called out, Quintessence swirling around his body as
he lead the charge across the desert skies. "My God &ndash; it's like the beginning
of <i>the</i> <i>Great Zack Walkabout</i>..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Those four words sent a chill
through even the most senior of the Ringbearers in the formation; Archangel,
with Julie Renner close behind, took up the lead. "No screw-ups, people &ndash; in
desert conditions, those things can survive for years and infect God knows how
many people! Medavoy, Barris, Sharp, Hannon &ndash; shadow 'port with all of the
fire-affinity Bearers and set up a flame barrier behind them a good four miles
across &ndash; make sure none of those bastards slips back and gets away!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Sixteen Ringbearers
disappeared, tiny blips of darkness hanging in the air where they were for an
instant as the African-American Ringbearer turned to Renner. "Take ten people &ndash;
you see that road? When we start blasting, any MetaZacks hiding in the bunch
will make for it &ndash; it's the easiest way out of the box we're going to drop on
them, so when they try to head out that way, you bag them. Don't take any
unnecessary risks &ndash; HQ wants more for study &ndash; but if things get bad, you dust
them all."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Actually, I'm doing gold
today," the young woman laughed. "I want to get that house in Florida, but with
what's happened on Wall Street over the past couple of weeks, it'll be
impossible to get a loan!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Make sure that you get good
insurance on the place-" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Why do you think I'm gonna
Midasize every Zack I see today &ndash; do you know how much they're charging for
home insurance down there?" She gave Archangel a sloppy half-salute, then
banked away, motioning for several other Ringbearers to follow along as her
superior shook his head, and then called out a single word. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1 style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Beavis-!"</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>In an instant, a blonde-haired,
scrawny young man appeared from darkness in front of him, and then darted about
with the excited manner of a puppy being teased with bits of meat dangled above
his head. "Yeah, Boss? Yeah? Yeah? Can I get me some? Can I?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Archangel noticed the way the
boy wore his t-shirt (a blue one with a particularly outrageous image of a
barely-clad, white-haired woman with a sword in one hand and a severed head in
another, standing on the words 'HEAVY METAL') and swore a dark and unholy
punishment on whoever the idiot was that showed Beavis that he could make an
unlimited supply of glazed doughnuts and triple-espresso coffee with his Ring. <i>I
think that maybe a month or two using his or her Ring on custodial detail on
one of the planet-side bases, cleaning up after everyone and having to sanitize
toilets and urinals, will make that person think twice before they teach him
any more new tricks. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I am &ndash; <i>Flameholio</i>! I
need no TP &ndash; I shoot fireballs from my bunghole!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>Oh, Lord. </i>"Beavis!
You're taking the lead today!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>It was almost as if the sky
itself had caught fire. <i>"Fire!"</i> the boy yelled, white-hot tongues of
flame dancing across his body as he activated his elemental-affinity power and
augmented it with the power of his Defender Ring "<i>Firefirefirefirefire!</i>
Yeah! Yeah! <u>Yeah</u>! <i>Burn!</i>"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Go get 'em, kid." Archangel
said, activating his lifeforce armor (<i>thank God I've got a First Ring</i>,
he thought, <i>the extras help out</i>) before surrounding himself in a corona
of flame and waving the other Ringbearers forward after Beavis. "Attack!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>*****</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria watched as a pale-skinned
twenty-something woman with short black hair, impossibly long legs and wearing
a Maple Leafs hockey jersey hand Archangel a glass of punch before easing
herself down upon the couch between him and another whose entire look screamed
'soccer mom'. The young woman looked around the room and counted to fifty
before trusting herself to speak.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Wait a minute. You're saying
that - <i>you set Beavis loose on a crowd of innocent people?"<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Robert shrugged. "Well, we
didn't know that at the time."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Archangel transmuted the water
in the shot glass next to him into <i>aqua vitae</i> &ndash; an incredibly potent
alcohol-based fluid &ndash; then poured it into his punch. "Over half a million
people from all over the world. Biggest damn 'zombie walk' I've ever seen. I <u>really</u>
hate 'zombie walks."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"We had to throw the entire
planet into temporal stasis," Julie added, wincing as she saw Archangel drink
the entire cup of punch and visibly recoil from the effect. "It took us two
weeks to revive and heal everyone we roasted. Oh, people were pissed off!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Not everyone," the leggy
Canadian yawned, selecting a chicken wing from the large platter of snacks that
floated around the room &ndash; something that Daria noticed everyone else there
seemed to treat as a normal thing, as she saw from the way Robert took a small dish
from the platter and spooned several large BBQ meatballs from a covered dish.
"They took the compensation, didn't they? We cured a few diseases on their
world, and the Shipstone power systems we started them off on will cure all
their energy problems inside a decade. Don't forget that we gave everyone at
Burning Man who got roasted a perfect human form, and blanked their memory of
getting toasted &ndash; plus, we gave each of them ten thousand Euros and ten ounces
of diamonds."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Don't forget the terraforming,"
the 'soccer mom' spoke up. The Middle East on that world is going to be a
breadbasket this time next year. Oh, yeah. They've got passenger pigeons again,
and cats. Idiots killed most of them off during the Middle Ages, except for
those Siamese hybrids in Asia. I've <u>never</u> seen a housecat the size of a
mountain lion before..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1 style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='font-style:normal'>Daria was so
besides herself that several questions that popped up in her head went unasked </span>"You
let Beavis loose to burn hundreds of thousands of people to death!"</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Being fair, it wasn't his
fault," Robert told her. "Besides, we did revive them."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria gave her boyfriend a look
that should have sent his head bouncing merrily away from his shoulders. "Well,
wasn't <i><u>that</u></i> was nice of you. I mean, don't those Rings of yours
tell you 'hey, those <u>aren't</u> zombies' before you make a crowd of people
do the 'Burning Man' dance?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Several snorts of laughter
filled the apartment, and Daria turned to see the leggy Canadian bury her face
in her hands, shaking as she tried not to laugh. The 'soccer mom' busied
herself tearing off sheets from the roll of paper towels she drew from the
kitchen with her TK as Archangel and a few other Ringbearers, looking a bit
tipsy, didn't try to hide their mirth &ndash; or their glasses still.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"There are," a reed-thin young
man with a New England accent said, glancing in Daria's direction as he enjoyed
a piece of <i>flan</i>. "Problem was, it was a newbie Ringbearer that sounded
the alarm &ndash; she's only a month out of training, everything looked like a
textbook upper-level Class Three outbreak about to explode into Class Four...
even the media was covering it like it was the real thing. Dumb ass news people
and their 'sweeps month' stories."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"She did everything right,
except for scanning them before sending an alert &ndash; and being honest, I'd
probably have sent the alert before going in close, too," the Slavic woman with
the old eyes spoke up. "She'll get extra training &ndash; and it'll be a while before
she gets a Whisperer post again. Archangel, make sure she gets assigned to one
of the ships."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria turned as she felt
something nudging gently at her arm, and looked down to see the floating
platter next to her. "No, thank you," she said, and the platter floated away.
"Does this happen often &ndash; mistaking normal people for the undead?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Only in the Dakotas &ndash; and
Eastern Europe, too," the New Englander cut in. "Weird. It's like that on every
Earth that's has even the slightest Z-outbreak. They warn you about in
training."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The room was quiet for a
moment. "Everyone, consider yourselves on forty-eight hours liberty," the
Slavic woman said, standing up and placing her empty saucer on a table. "If you
decide to use one of the rooms here, please remember to lock the door and use
your v-fields. They don't know about us on this Earth, so remember - no funny
stuff, and no sightseeing. If you want to leave for somewhere else, use the
portal set up on the third floor."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Pulling Archangel off the
couch, the Slavic woman led him through a door Daria knew had never been in the
apartment before, and ignored the sound of footsteps as Robert tugged at her
sleeve.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Aren't you all taking this a
bit calmly?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Leave them be," Robert said
softly. "People let it go in their own ways &ndash; and when you've seen as much as
some of them... hey, read this."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria took the small booklet
Robert handed over to her, placing his dish on a platter as it passes by. "I
picked it up back there. Normally, I wouldn't get anything from another
reality, but this..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria drew her attention from
the pale Canadian and the 'soccer mom', holding hands as they headed for the
door leading 'upstairs', to the booklet that still smelled faintly of burnt
paper. <i>&quot;We of the Global Coalition for Necro-Animatory Syndrome
Cultural Awareness and Sensitivity object to the outdated and offensive term
