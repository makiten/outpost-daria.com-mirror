<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The young, dishwater-blonde
waitress whose nametag read 'Molly' slid the empty dishes off the table, giving
the man that sat there alone a smile. "Want some more coffee, hon?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Thank you, no." He was always
so polite, she thought, especially for a Black guy &ndash; the ones who came in were
usually the 'young thug' wannabes who cursed instead of talked - and his voice
&amp; manner just didn't match up with his clothes. Threadbare denims, a faded
blue button-down shirt, sneakers so worn that she'd offered on a couple of
occasions to give him a ride down to the outreach center to get new things &ndash;
he'd always refused, in that polite but firm way that she had learned to
associated with poor people who hadn't been down on their luck long enough to
have lost their pride - and that old black overcoat that he always kept with
him, as if afraid that someone would take it... </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>It must be one of the last
things from his life before he hit the streets,</i> she thought, remembering
the label she'd seen inside one time and noting that brand new, it would have
probably cost in the mid-four figures. <i>Poor guy. Lots of folks end up washed
out and camped out on the streets of L.A. &ndash; lots of folks who were something
once, with nobody to take care of them or even care...<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She gave him his change, and
was surprised when he shook his head. "Keep it." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"But it's a <i>ten</i>-" She
felt almost offended by the way he turned back to pick up his cup of coffee,
but pressed on anyway. "You know, you've been coming in here for a few months &ndash;
you're all but a regular here."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I like the biscuits and
gravy."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"That's probably one of the few
things I know about you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Nothing about me worth
knowing." He sipped from the cup, set it down, and Molly refilled it from the
glass coffeepot on her wheeled tray. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I don't even know your name."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The man was silent as he took
six packets of sugar by their ends and shook them, then tore them open gently
and emptied them into the coffee; the waitress watched as he started to open up
the tiny containers of coffee cream, knowing from past experience that he would
empty at least ten into his cup.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

coffee."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>Now, what was I thinking?
Oh, yeah.</i> <i>Of course I don't date Black guys.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The man began to stir his
coffee, and Molly turned away. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Michael." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The waitress turned back,
smiling as the man looked up at her with those brown eyes that she found sad
and fascinating. "They call me Michael."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Well, then &ndash; you have a nice
day... 'Michael."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>A smile on her face, Molly Preston
pushed her tray of dirty dishes across the floor and through the swinging doors
that lead to the kitchen area of the <i>'</i>247 Diner'. <i>I mean, he's not
bad-looking, he's got those huge hands, and the whole 'big dog with the lost
puppy' feel can draw a girl in, but he's <u>homeless</u> &ndash; and some things are
just not done-</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Stop staring at the man,
Molly," a flip voice spoke up from behind, and the twenty-something waitress
turned slowly to see Dana Hu standing just behind her, huge eyes (for a girl of
Asian descent, Molly always thought) twinkling as she gave her a smile. "That
your latest hard-luck project, Molly?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"He comes in once a month," was
the reply. "Always orders the same thing &ndash; large order of biscuits and gravy,
waffle fries with side orders of ranch dressing and cheese &ndash; separate cups &ndash; a
large Sprite, and he goes through coffee like it's about to get taken off the
market."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"That's the guy &ndash; Mister 'lotsa
sugar, lotsa cream'?" The wispy Asian beauty peered on tip-toe over Molly's
shoulder at the man, now draining the last dregs from his coffee cup. "You've
been talking about him for six months, Molly. Tell me that you at least know
his name." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I barely know anything about
him, except his name," Molly countered. "The only think I've ever been able to find
out is that a couple of times a month, he goes over to Drennel's A-to-Z Pawn. I
guess he hocks something there for a few bucks - or gets them to give him some
cash for the food stamps &ndash; and shows up here exactly a day later to eat his
usual."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You'll have to put your latest
potential fixer-upper out of your mind for a minute," Dana said, smiling as she
turned her friend's head in the direction of two handsome young men, sipping
coffee as they sat in the booth next to the front door of the diner. "Time for
you to remember that the only spoon you need to work with is one you're gonna
need to eat that yummy boy out there up with! Guess who's gotten us both dates
&ndash; and they can get us into the party at Tommy Sherman's place in the Hills!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Molly squealed. "No!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You need to go in that
washroom, scour off the scent of the meatloaf special, and get ready to have
some fun tonight!" Dana squealed back. "Those NBA types have the craziest
parties &ndash; remember how the Lakers nearly suspended him because he missed a game
because he had one party going until an hour before game time? Come on &ndash; we
can't miss this!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Fifteen minutes later, Molly
emerged from the kitchen area behind Dana, a totally different appearance that
made the two young man waiting look up in surprise. "Molly &ndash; this is Chris,"
Dana said, nodding towards the tall, athletic man who towered over her. "He's
mine. That's Troy. He's yours."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The handsome, muscular young
man rose from the table, and Molly forced herself not to stare as he shook her hand.
"Molly, right? Dana's told me a lot about you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Not everything &ndash; I promise,"
Dana giggled, Chris' hand firmly in her own. "He's gotta find out some things
on his own!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Molly glared at her friend, who
smiled and breezed past, boy-toy in tow. "Come on, Molly. Time to be a girl for
a while!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>None of them noticed Michael as
they left &ndash; or noticed the expression on his face as his eyes followed out the
door. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>There was something about the
way that Michael moved, slipping into his overcoat as he headed towards the
front door, which made the diners who noticed him shudder inwardly and promise
themselves that they wouldn't come back for a long time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"The fastest way to the parking
lot is down this way," Chris said, leading Dana down a darkened alley as Molly
followed, with Troy bringing up the rear. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I can't believe that you're
getting us into a Tommy Sherman party!" Molly gushed. "It's going to be so
cool!" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I think that we can have
ourselves a little party right here, right now," Troy growled, and Molly
shrieked as she felt his hand slide beneath her arm to grasp at her right
breast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Get away from me!" she cried
out, jumping away from the leering Troy as Dana suddenly felt Chris' hands grip
her shoulders; the world spun around her as she felt him push her hard against
a brick wall, and she cried out as she fell to the ground! "Leave her alone!"
Molly screamed, struggling in Troy's iron grip as Chris pulled a stunned Dana
to her feet. "Leave us-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Molly's scream of terror as a
man dropped from the sky in front of them &ndash; on his feet, without making a
body-wide splat &ndash; echoed through the deep artificial canyon of the alley.
"That's not going to help you," the new arrival said, holding up his hand so
that the blonde could see the coppery band on his right ring finger. "In this
alley... no one can hear you scream."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Hurry up, James<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&ndash; I'm starving!" Troy said, causing Molly to
go white with terror, screaming as he jerked her head back to see his face
contort, his pupils turn blood red, and his incisors extend into fangs. "Do
your thing, so we can eat!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Dana gasped as James pulled her
from Chris' grip, and the scent of urine was suddenly strong in the area as the
young woman soiled herself at the sight of James' eyes; as he curled his right
hand into a fist and pointed at her face, his pupils began to glow with the
brilliant hue of burning copper. "First I get your life-force, and then, my
friends get what's left. Don't worry, boys &ndash; I'll leave enough to keep them
warm while you eat."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Excuse me &ndash; waitress &ndash; can I
get some more coffee?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The five persons in the alley
turned as one to see Michael, holding a coffee cup out in his right hand as he
walked towards them. "I gave you a tip, and I drank my coffee, and you didn't
come back to give me a refill. I thought it was supposed to be the
buck-forty-nine all-you-can-drink cup of coffee..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Get lost, Mandingo," James
growled, as Michael walked towards him &ndash; stumbling a bit, as the loose sole on
his right shoe caught on the street &ndash; and came up to him. "Soup kitchen's
closed. Carry your black ass on before someone forgets where they are and hangs
you from a tree somewhere."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Michael stopped, drawing back
slightly as he saw the way James eyes glowed with copper fire; for his part,
James recoiled as he smelled the strong scent of alcohol on the man's clothes.
"Damn, my brotha &ndash; those is some messed-up contacts they hooked you up with.
You need to take them bad boys back to Wal-Mart and have them set you up right
&ndash; me, I'd be slapping fire from somebody's ass, 'cause you look like something
straight off late-night cable."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Disgusted by the way Michael
reached out to try and touch his face, James pushed Dana into Chris' arms and
turned back to punch him-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>James grunted in pain,
stumbling back with stars in his eyes as Michael smashed into his face with a
solid right cross; Dana whimpered in pain as she was suddenly released from
Chris' grip, the girl falling forward as a savage forward kick sent him flying
back against a wall!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Throwing Molly aside, Troy
rushed Michael as Chris immediately leaped up from the wall and charged him
from the opposite direction &ndash; and both vampires let death-shrieks escape from
them, impaling themselves as he held his hands out like claws; a momentary
flash of copper light was blocked by their bodies as the air around his hands
transmuted into wood... and their hearts ripped from their chests, dissolving
into dust mere seconds before their bodies followed suit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The gory gauntlets dropped away
from Michael's hands as he turned and grunted in pain as the pipe James swung
dropped him to his knees. "Not a good life decision."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>James stepped back, stunned as
a pair of shimmering copper eyes stared up from the floor of the alley; he felt
himself being tossed through the air on a vicious wave of telekinetic energy,
bones in his body being broken in mid-air by the violent concussive force that
radiated through the sudden, burning light &ndash; and as he hit the edge of the open
dumpster and screamed with pain as his body dropped to the ground, it was only
then that he felt the burning in his right wrist, and realized that his hand
was missing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>A copper light flashed from the
ring now visible on Michael's hand as the severed hand on the ground and the
wooden mittens dissipated into gas, and the two young women watched as he
picked up the ring from the ground. "Oh, God," Molly whimpered, her eyes full
of fear and yet brimming over with gratitude. "They were going to &ndash; we were &ndash;
God, I don't &ndash; thank you..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Michael kept his back turned
away from them. "Go home."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You fought those &ndash; whatever
they were &ndash; you <i>saved</i> us-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Molly stepped back by reflex as
Michael turned &ndash; and she felt her breath catch in her throat as she looked into
his eyes of burning copper. <i>"Get away from me."</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Wordlessly, the girl stepped back
when she noticed the coffee cup, undamaged as it sat on the ground, and she
stooped down to pick it up; as she did so, she failed to notice the way Michael
scooped a handful of water from inside a rusted-out half-barrel and tossed it
over James.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The putrid-sweet scent of
burning flesh and the sound of James' scream filled the alley as the fluid
began to rapidly dissolve his body into nothingness; a clap of thunder echoed
through the area, drowning out the pitiful death gurgles as lightning split the
air overhead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The two young women stood in
the alley, holding close to each other in the rain as they watched the man who
had saved them walking away, disappearing into the flash-and-black of the storm
and the artificial canyon of a Los Angeles alley.</p>
