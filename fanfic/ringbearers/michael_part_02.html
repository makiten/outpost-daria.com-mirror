<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Michael didn't even bother to
turn the lights on in the basement-conversion apartment that had been his home
for the past three years. He opened door of the closet several paces away from
the 1930's-era elevator that was the main entrance to the apartment, kicked his
shoes off and then slid out of his overcoat. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>A shower of sprinkles fell away
from the fabric as he used his Vengeance Ring to transmute the <i>aqua vitae</i>
the coat was soaked with into gold dust, and then scooped every bit of it up
with his telekinesis. <i>The idiots at Drennel's A-to-Z pay top price &ndash; and
I'll just slip the cash into the first red kettle I see. The gold coin
gimmick's old and silver coins aren't worth as much &ndash; Euros. I'll shadow 'port
up to San Francisco, exchange a few pounds of gold with the pawn shops there,
and hit several of the foreign banks up there for Euros. A few thousand of them
in the kettles will be a nice change of pace, and the publicity will cause more
people to donate. I hate the Christmas season.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Reaching for a one-pint Mason
jar that was half-full with gold dust, Michael let his TK power funnel the dust
into the jar, then placed it back besides the seven others on the shelf. <i>My
version of the change jar. Anytime I get filthy out in the street, I strip the
gunk out of my clothes with my TK, transmute it into gold, and toss one of
those jars to the landlord every six months or so. Between that, the occasional
healing that I do around here with my 'special healing teas' and dropping cash
anonymously on bills for people here when they run short &ndash; and they know it's
me - the people in the area keep their mouths shut.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>A feeling of total exhaustion
pushed through Michael, and he dragged himself to the couch. "There's no reason
why you should be so damned tired," a voice spoke from the darkness, and
Michael's eyes snapped open. "I understand self-abuse &ndash; but you know that the
Ring isn't going to allow you to kill yourself, and if you push, you know it's
going to force you."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Michael lifted his head, and
his eyes narrowed as he saw an attractive thirty-something woman with brown
hair, sheathed in a gleaming-white power suit that accentuated her shapely
figure. "Every once in a great while, you need to go out into the sunlight and
recharge your Ring. A meager meal of your favorite comfort foods and enough
coffee to flood out the greater Los Angeles Metro area isn't going to power
that piece of jewelry, and we can't have you doing anything untoward &ndash; can we?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Who the hell are you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The woman walked out of the
shadows. "My name's Helen Barksdale. I'm a senior associate for the law firm of
Wolfram and Hart."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Really? Then I'm sure that you
understand the meaning of terms like 'criminal trespass', 'breaking and
entering', and my personal favorite &ndash;'defenestration."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Helen shook her head and sighed
dismissal of his threat. "That's not possible, sir &ndash; you live in a <i>basement.</i>"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I didn't say that you'd enjoy
the procedure. Leaving an apartment is much more painful if you're <i>making</i>
the window instead of simply <i>leaving</i> through one."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Blatantly ignoring Michael,
Helen slipped out of her jacket as she looked around the apartment. "Hmm. For
the appearance you favor on the streets, you keep your home surprisingly clean.
Spartan, but clean &ndash; bordering on antiseptic."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I'll give you a referral to
the girl that comes in and dusts. Her name's Jenny. Her number's 867-5309."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Helen gave Michael a glance
that could cut glass, and then peeked inside the refrigerator. "Oh, look at
this &ndash; blueberry Jell-O."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Before Michael could rise from
the couch, Helen pinched a marble-sized chunk from the large brick of a
gelatinous blue substance that sat on a plate, alone inside the refrigerator.
"I'm actually more of a dairy girl, though."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The chunk immediately
transformed into a waffle cone with a scoop of strawberry ice cream. "Just like
they used to make back at the commune, just after I got out of college," she
said, tasting the dessert. "You can taste just how fresh the strawberries are..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"All right," Michael conceded,
rising from the couch. "You know about the Ring and the sunlight limitation,
and you know about ambrosia. What do you want?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Annoyance began to build as
Helen walked back and sat down on the couch, crossing a pair of spectacular
legs as she lounged back. "I'd like to tell you a story," she said, smiling as
she took another lick from the cone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"If you're going to put me to
bed &ndash; I'm a bit old for stories. How about a warm glass of milk &ndash; or you could
just get rid of that outfit. Oh, and go slow, so I can enjoy the view."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"All in good time," Helen said.
"As I was saying &ndash; I wanted to tell you a story. A long time ago, in another
place and time, there was another Earth."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Shouldn't you be trying to
sell this to Lucas? After the <i>Star Wars</i> prequels, I'd say he could use
some new ideas."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The beautiful lawyer sighed.
"As I was saying, there was another Earth &ndash; an Earth that was at least a
millennium ahead of our world in every way. Scientifically, culturally,
academically &ndash; they had colonized their solar system, with several cities of
over a million beings on the moon and not just undersea cities, but undersea
nations. Greater Macronesia, the Federated Republic of Atlantis, New Argentina
&ndash; about forty undersea nations, with just over a billion citizens who live
under the Earth's seas. They've also got colonies throughout the Milky Way
Galaxy &ndash; and they've made friends with so many other races."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Yeah, you're going to need a
twist to that story," Michael said, leaning against a wall. "Already seen
enough <i>Star Trek</i> to know that they'd come looking for you. Paramount's
got some evil lawyers."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"As I was saying," Helen
continued. "The reason for all of this was because of 'the Age of
Illumination'. On this world, there were no 'Dark Ages' &ndash; no Black Plague, no
Inquisition, no crazed churches declaring knowledge evil and burning libraries
&ndash; mankind basically as a race decided that learning was a good thing. Trust me
&ndash; they don't have folks like George Bush in charge there."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She enjoyed another bite of her
cone. "Of course, in any story like this, there has to be something bad that
happens. Nothing that good and that nice can move along before something just
as bad comes along to balance out the equation..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>As Helen spoke, Michael felt
his memory wind back, to a time long, long since past...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'>He recalled the waves of
bodies, moving across the countryside like a matted, disease-laden carpet of
slowly animated, decomposing flesh, a singularly horrific communal moan coming
from the mass that terrified everything living before it and drove them ahead...
continuously ahead, moving on until there was nowhere left to run...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Zombies. A few meteors dropped
on the planet one day &ndash; and soon enough, you had hundreds of thousands of the
undead carousing about as they will, making life quite unpleasant for everyone.
Fortunately, a world that was a millennium more advanced than ours had ways of
defending itself from the hordes of the undead... "</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Michael recalled the memories
of others, taken forcefully; memories of a city built into the base of a
mountain under siege, with a barrier wall forty feet high surrounding the
entire city a half-mile away from its borders &ndash; a barrier wall of tempered
glass fifteen feet thick. He watched as thousands of men and women, safely
behind the wall, adjusted mortar-like devices they had set up and began to
rapid-fire projectiles over the wall in a carpet-volley formation... the
canisters struck over a mile away, deep within the overwhelming mass of undead,
implanted themselves deep into the ground and opened to send ten-foot-tall
spikes of energy skyward.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>Blood and gore began to spew
about the area as intense gravity fields emitted by the thick columns pulled
zombies by the tens of thousands inside the artificial solar constructs &ndash;
shaped energy weapons that were active for only six seconds, and could
devastate armies within that time. In seconds, tens of thousands of the undead
were erased from existence.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>On an overgrown expanse of
grass and weeds that was once a beautiful park, a single massive armored
vehicle sat alone, blaring noise from a pair of speakers bolted to the immense
turret that drew the undead in from all corners of an empty urban area that
once housed millions. The untold numbers of undead grew closer, and closer...<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>A dome of burning, solid
light shimmered into existence over the vehicle, and like lemmings over a
cliff's edge, zombies unknowingly walked into oblivion by the thousands as they
incinerated themselves upon the plasma shell; eleven hours later, the crew of
the vehicle would shut the energy field off, and set off for another location
to destroy more of the undead.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Crowds of terrified people
watched from every vantage point as hundreds of soldiers fired at will upon the
slowly advancing hordes of the undead; even with the hideously effective
vibratory-shock weapons they used &ndash; weapons that blew apart everything within a
one-meter radius of where the discharge struck &ndash; the creatures were still
moving forward...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Despite all of their
technology, they were barely holding their own &ndash; but then, the tide turned."
Helen smiled at Michael. "That's when another group of people entered the
scene." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"There was a group of big
brained-types on this Earth," Helen said, <i>as Michael saw twin towers of
gleaming material that dominated the skyline upon what, on most other Earths,
was Manhattan Island</i>. "They specialized in what was called 'Alchemic
Technologies.' You know the old saying, 'Any sufficiently advanced technology
is indistinguishable from magic?'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>In his mind's eye, Michael
saw what looked like a Level Four biological warfare laboratory, with men and
women in containment suits, air and cooling hoses connecting them to the walls
of the lab, as they worked with a miniature smelter held aloft by antigravity fields
as tiny streams of metal were poured into waiting molds and kept liquid by
arcane energies generated through the series of runes that continually floated
through the air and passed down through the molds...<o:p></o:p></i></p>

protect." Helen turned around to face him. "Hey, could you whip up a glass of

allows you an effectively bottomless drink," she commented, shaking the can to
show that it was almost empty. "As long as you can envision the container being

fighting supernatural creatures and keeping yourself apart from people as an
eternal penance &ndash; let me ask you something. What's keeping you going? You were
somehow able to work yourself past the guilt to find a connection with that
girl. You managed to find it in yourself to be able to love, but now, you're
denying yourself a connection to those people you're trying to save. If you're
not careful, one day you're going to go out, fail to save someone and you'll
go, 'Oh, well. I didn't save one. If you look at all of the ones I've saved,
