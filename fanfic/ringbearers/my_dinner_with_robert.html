<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Easy on that soup there,
Jane."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane Lane looked up from the
very large bowl of meat, thick broth and chopped vegetables, a huge smile on
her face as she hefted her spoon to her lips and enjoyed the mixture while
Robert Nelson watched from the other side of the kitchen table. "No wonder
you've always been a long-distance runner &ndash; if you're going to eat like that,
it keeps the pounds down."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The raven-haired girl looked up
from her bowl. "This tastes just like the oxtail soup Old Socrates made when I
was living at the commune," she said, barely able to keep the smile off her
face as she dipped the spoon back into the fragrant dish. "No wonder you and
Daria get along so well &ndash; and if you can make any type of food with that
ambrosia, even Mrs. Morgendorffer will like you a lot. God, even this cornbread
is just like I remember it &ndash; crunchy on top and bottom, with just a touch of
sweetness..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Robert smiled as Jane
demolished a wedge of warm cornbread crumpled another wedge into her soup,
almost childlike as she half-stirred, half-chopped at the thick ingredients in
the heavy earthenware bowl for almost a minute before taking another heaping
spoonful and devouring it. "Yeah. That's good. This ambrosia stuff <i><u>rocks</u></i>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The Ringbearer glanced over
from the teenager enjoying her supper to the very large iron pot of soup
warming on the stove in the kitchen of Casa Lane, and Jane shrugged as her eyes
followed Robert's gaze. "I wanted to have enough for Trent and the rest of the
spiral &ndash; they always show up when there's food in the house. I think they
traded their musical talent for the ability to track down all-you-can-eat
supplies of free food."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The large kitchen rang with the
sounds of Robert's laughter. "Daria's mentioned your brother and his band once
or twice. Tell me something &ndash; did she have a crush or something? Not jealous;
she just gets this very tiny little blush when I mentioned that Julie's always
been into guys that look like that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Well, it didn't go anywhere
because my brother never went anywhere besides his bedroom. To sleep, I mean.
He probably wouldn't have been able to stay awake for anything else. You know
what I mean."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Yeah. Just the way Julie likes
them."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The room was silent for a few
minutes as Robert watched Jane eat. "So, how's life going as you're 'protecting
us from the alien scum of the universe?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"That's the <i>Green Lanterns</i>.
Our charter deals with protecting you from the <u>supernatural</u> scum of the
universe &ndash; but if we happen to come across alien bad guys, we're allowed to
kick a little boo-tay in defending ourselves or stopping the threat. We don't
get big press coverage like they do, but people who've heard of us basically
stay out of our way."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane looked at him. "There's
really <i>Green Lanterns</i> &ndash; like in the comic books?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Robert looked at her for a
moment, and then began to laugh. "No. That's just in the comic books."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"So, your rings don't work like
that?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Robert turned to Jane. "Like
what?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Well, all the rules and stuff
&ndash; and do you have a costume? Something tight and Spandexy, with a cute little
mask?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"No costume, no Spandex and no
mask &ndash; although I've noticed that a lot of Ringbearers tend to wear the color
blue when they're off doing Ringbearer duties on worlds where we've able to
work in public, and on the ships." Robert smiled. "Some of us just wear
whatever, and then there's Beavis..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>He shook his head. "I'll just
say this &ndash; some people read too many comic books and watch entirely too many of
the wrong things on TV. "</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"So there's no weakness
against, I don't know, the color of mandarin orange?" Jane winced at the gaze
Robert gave her. "You're not going to turn me into a turnip or a loaf of
zucchini bread, are you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Robert took a fork, speared a
large potato chunk, and held it up for Jane to see. "If I give you this and
turn it to gold, will you not act like that?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane laughed at the teasing
tone to his voice. "All I gotta say is that you'd better never do anything like
that to Daria, or she'll roast you &ndash; whoa." She saw the look that suddenly
crossed Robert's face. "You offered her something like that and she went
ballistic, didn't you? Oh, I bet that was fun!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The young man was about to put
the potato back when Jane caught his hand. "Hey &ndash; a deal's a deal!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>A look of bewilderment crossed
Robert's face. "But &ndash; I mean, you just said about Daria-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Daria's mom's a big-time
lawyer, and they've never really wanted for anything," Jane replied; Robert
suddenly sensed the sharp pang of pain that the young woman, he realized, kept
suppressed the majority of the time. "She doesn't know what it's really like to
be without, so of course she's going to get offended if someone gives her
something like that. She's also so into being seen as different from Quinn &ndash;
well, you know what I mean..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane looked at Robert, who had
understanding on his face. "Don't get me wrong. She's my best friend &ndash; I love
her like a sister &ndash; but she sometimes doesn't understand just how easy she's
had things..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She looked down at her soup,
suddenly at a loss for words; Robert looked at her for a long moment, and then
stood up from the table. "Come on &ndash; let's walk some of that food off."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Hey &ndash; Daria's going to be back
in a half-hour, she said-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Come on &ndash; I'll buy you an ice
cream cone."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>*****</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The Ringbearer stepped through
the large, gleaming purplish-white ring of energy, followed by a wide-eyed
Jane. "I don't think that I could ever get used to that," she said, looking
around her at the beautiful body of water they appeared next to. "Where are
we?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"A place that's slightly
stranger than you'd imagine," was the reply. "By the way &ndash; in case we get
separated, just remember one thing. If anyone asks you, in case they need to
send you home, your address is 'D-320'. Remember that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Okay..." She took a better look
across the vast lake &ndash; <i>it's got to be a lake, and a big one, because I don't
taste the salt that would mean that this was an ocean</i> &ndash; and saw the
unusually high line of five skyscrapers, each easily the size of the old World
Trade Center. "Whoa. That's just &ndash; I mean, look at them-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"If you think that's
impressive, look a little further to the west," Robert said, pointing across
the waters at something in the distance. "See that?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"What &ndash; what the hell is that?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"That's a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Sky Bridge</i> &ndash; it's about a hundred miles away," he told her, as she
stared at the shining, ropelike construct that seemed to hang impossibly in
midair as it went into the upper atmosphere and beyond the range of the naked
eye. "It's basically a tourist thing, and a way to move lots and lots of
freight without paying as much as you would any other way. The whole thing's a
giant transit tube that uses antigravity to let people and cargo head into
outer space to the Construct, where they can travel anywhere in the universe.
Oh, and the place is basically a huge Disney World in space. I'll probably take
Daria there for her birthday."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Oh, man," said Jane, realizing
just how big the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sky Bridge</i> was, if
it looked that big and was one hundred miles away. "I've GOT to remember that
and make a painting of it!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"What if I were to tell you
that you wouldn't have to remember it?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"What?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Robert sat down on the soft
grassy shoreline. "First, would you believe me if I told you that we were now
on a different Earth &ndash; but on the Earth we're on now, we're inside a hotel in
New Orleans, and this lake isn't a lake per se... well, it is, but it's also the
way humans perceive a very big natural interdimensional interconnection that
humans and other beings use to travel all over through all of Creation?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Why not? All you have to do is
give me and Daria Valley Girl accents, a phone booth that travels through time
and keep the Daleks from getting us before we get the historical figures back
to Lawndale and our history report, otherwise, Daria's dad is going to send her
to Buxton Ridge Military Academy in Alaska &ndash; and we'll never be able to start
up our band!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The Ringbearer began laughing
so hard that he could barely sit up. "What the hell's wrong with you?" Jane
asked, as Robert finally managed to stop laughing and wiped tears from his
eyes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Just something I remember from
when I first got the ring," he told her, recalling the look of absolute disgust
that Priscilla Henry &ndash; <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Valkyrie</i>, he
corrected himself &ndash; had on her face when she told him about meeting the two
young men who were just film characters in most realities, but were the real
thing and the saviors of their world in another. "They <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><u>did</u></i> get better'..." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane felt the urge to reply to
Robert's last words, or at least ask if he meant what she thought, but fought
it off valiantly. "You were asking be something?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Yes." Robert's face grew
somber. "Daria's told you what's been going on, right?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane's face took on a similar
expression. "Yeah, she did."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Jane &ndash; I can't be selfish or
deluded enough to think that I can always protect her." He looked over at Jane,
who sat down beside him. "She told you about the shield &ndash; and what happened at
the restaurant?" Jane's expression answered for her. "Well, she'll have to do
that. In any case &ndash; let me tell you something else about the Rings. Something I
didn't tell Daria yet, because &ndash; what you said about transmuting things for
her? I did that &ndash; I changed a rose into gold, and she was offended-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane chuckled as she shook her
head. "That's my Daria. Probably thought you were trying to buy her way into
her pants, and didn't think that you were just giving her something nice
because you liked her. Eh. She gets that way &ndash; and as I saw, you both got past
that, not to mention several other things, like second and probably third
base..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You do realize that I can toss
you into high orbit with my TK, right?" He smiled at her. "There's a way that
she would be able to protect herself &ndash; but I'm afraid that if I offer it to
her, or even bring it up, it'll be a sticking point."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"What &ndash; you can give her one of
those Rings, too? Cool!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"It's not like that. The Rings
&ndash; well, they're not alive, but they &ndash; bottom line, very few people can wear a
Ring. You have to be a certain type of person &ndash; and even then, the Rings won't
let you do anything that you personally know to be an evil act. Things that are
distasteful, or even things that you consider morally objectionable, if
absolutely necessary &ndash; <i>but it will not let you commit an act of Evil.</i>
Problem is &ndash; people do things they know to be just that in order to survive,
get a mission completed, or just because they want to &ndash; and most people fit
that description. That's why one of the first endowments placed upon the Rings
was the morality inhibitor; a Defender Ring without one, even in the hands of
an average person, would be..." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Robert shuddered, thinking of
what he'd seen done with Defender Rings. "It would be - unpleasant. Thing is,
when a Ringbearer arrives on a world, he might need backup &ndash; and even finding
people the Ring would accept, it can only duplicate itself once per day &ndash;
another safety feature. What if you need a lot of assistance, right now?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Well, what do you do?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane felt a shudder as Robert
turned to her. "The ring has the ability to give people powers, Jane. Almost
any power that the Ring can manifest, it can give someone &ndash; any three powers
the Ringbearer wants to give that person. Plus, you can also be given the
ability to fly."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Robert continued, not realizing
how fast Jane's heart had begun to pound inside her chest. "There's something
else. Every living being has an inborn affinity with one of the seven
mythological elements &ndash; air, water, fire, metal, wood, Earth, and Quintessance
&ndash; that's pure life-energy, for lack of a better explanation. The Ring can
activate anyone's affinity and turn it into a actual power." He turned to Jane.
"Like you said earlier &ndash; you love Daria like a sister. If I asked you to &ndash;
would you protect her for me?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"No," Jane replied. "I'd
protect her for me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The young man nodded. "Hold out
your hand."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>For an instant, Jane felt a
flicker of fear - then held out her hand, and gasped as a blue light surrounded
her as soon as Robert took her hand in his. "I gave you telekinesis and the
ability to fly," Robert said, sensing the slight touch of pain that Jane felt
as the Ring did its work. "The ability to heal, the Ring's ability to sense
danger-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Cool &ndash; I've got my own
'spider-sense!'"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Robert sighed. "You'll also
have the Ring's ability to create 'Glamors' - remember how I turned invisible
the other day? You'll be able to appear as anyone you want, or just cloak
yourself so you seem invisible...oh, and I activated your elemental affinity."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The blue glow faded, Jane
smirked at Robert before crossing her legs into the yoga position she'd seen in
many movies &ndash; and the Ringbearer smiled as she floated into the air a foot over
his head. "I don't think I've seen anyone get a grip on their telekinesis that
fast," Robert said, as Jane did a slow, easy half-turn and roll in the air that
left her upside-down and smiling. "Nice control."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Yeah &ndash; but this isn't my TK."
Jane's smile grew even wider. "I'm flying..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The Ringbearer shook his head
as Jane came heads-up, and floated out over the water before turning back and
stepping down in front of Robert. "First &ndash; thank you," she told him. "Another
thing &ndash; you could have given me powers anywhere, like in the kitchen when we
were talking earlier. Why bring me here?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Well, I was going to take you
into Old Stanley's &ndash; that's the name of the hotel we're in right now &ndash; to their
Exchange. They take currency and other valuables from all over, and can change
it in for currency from wherever you came from." He reached into his pocket,
and Jane saw that he had (wrapped in a paper towel) the chunk of potato he had
taken from her bowl earlier. "One thing that Ringbearers can do &ndash; and many have
&ndash; is help out in the areas they stay in when on covert assignments. Every year,
one guy I met takes a handful of driveway pebbles and turns them into gold,
takes the gold and cashes it in to buy <em><span style='color:black;font-weight:
normal'>Kruggerrands</span></em> &ndash; and then, takes those and puts them into
Salvation Army kettles throughout the neighborhood during the Christmas season.
It helps them provide for more people, and the people who live there get a good
feeling, because they know someone who has the means to help actually is
helping out."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane smiled at him. "How long
have you been doing that?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I figured that if I could help
you out with a little gift-" He transmuted the chunk of potato into a diamond &ndash;
bypassing Jane's question as he did so &ndash; before transmuting the paper towel
into a beautiful piece of black silk that literally shone in the sunlight, and
wrapping the jewel in it. "Then, you'd have more time to spend with Daria
watching her back-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Robert, Daria and I aren't
going to do that for you. You'll have to watch her back yourself."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Robert blushed as he handed the
silk-wrapped jewel to Jane. "If you sell that in there, you'll clear enough to
take care of the mortgage on your house, and support yourself through your time
in college. When we get back, I can also show you where you need to go to set
up a banking account where they won't ask too many questions &ndash; they cater to
people in the trade, you know."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane looked at the jewel, and
put it in her jacket pocket. "Thank you," she said simply. "This &ndash; this means-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I'm just glad to help," he
said, ending the matter. "Now &ndash; just one more thing..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>A shriek of panic cut through
the air as Robert picked Jane up with his telekinesis, and tossed her in the
lake! "What was that for?" she hissed, thrashing about as she broke the surface,
clearly madder than a wet cat. "WHAT WAS THAT FOR?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"To show you that your danger sense
isn't automatic," he responded. "It stays on as long as you want and it doesn't
affect your powers or tire you out &ndash; but you have to turn it on and off
yourself. Also &ndash; the things that you don't see at threatening won't be picked
up as threats... or even worse, things that the people you care for don't see as
threats. You love your brother &ndash; but be careful about who hangs out with, he
trusts enough to come over."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Dripping wet, Jane fell silent
as the responsibility she had just taken on took effect. "Oh, she said finally,
forgetting that she was standing in a foot and a half of water.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Robert came to the edge of the
waters. "That's also payback for the clothes I accidentally transmuted because
of you. That was one of my favorite shirts!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Oh, yeah? You got full frontal
of me and Daria in your apartment!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Before the waters of a
tsunami-style wave seemed to suddenly sweep over Robert from the lake, the
Ringbearer could have sworn that he heard &ndash; in the back of his mind &ndash; Daria's
distinctive voice saying, <i>"Yeah. You were gonna pay for that one, anyway."</i>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>In the instant before the
waters hit, a small smile crossed Robert's face as he remembered another
ability he'd forgotten to mention to Daria &ndash; that the Ring could replay all of
his memories and broadcast them as 3-D holographic images.</p>
