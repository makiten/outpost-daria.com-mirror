<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Hey, Janey &ndash; this is some good
oxtail soup."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane Lane stepped into the
kitchen, a smile on her face that made the four members of Mystik Spiral look
up in surprise. "So, when did you make it &ndash; along those lines, when did you go
shopping?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I sold a couple of
reproductions to this guy that has a gallery downtown," Jane lied easily,
noticing that her brother Trent was too infatuated with his bowl of soup and
the huge, butter-covered chunk of warm cornbread to catch the lie. "Oh, and if
you guys eat up everything in here or suddenly decide to have a 'party' and
everything in the fridge, the freezer and the pantry disappears..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jesse, Nicolas and Max winced
in unison as each felt something grasp his genitals firmly and then, squeezed
down hard. "I'm going to be annoyed &ndash; okay?'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Trent's three friends didn't
freak out as the sensation vanished as quickly as it appeared; they had always
believed that Jane had some sort of witch-like powers anyway, and as a result
never did anything to really piss her off. Each of the three nodded quietly and
continued to eat, while Trent quickly finished off his bread and followed his
sister upstairs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>*****</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Janey. Got a moment?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The raven-haired young woman
appeared from her closet at the sound of Trent's voice, pulling an old shirt on
that she used whenever she decided to just 'freestyle' with her paintings. "We
should make about three, three-fifty each for the shows we've done this weekend
&ndash; I can give you back something on the groceries."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Cool."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Hey &ndash; look, I don't think, I
mean-" Jane's face brightened as Trent tried to stammer out words. "You know, I
don't want you to have to think that you're going to have to support me- I
mean, we've got money, but Mom and Dad, they just keep forgetting-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane held up a letter. "Dad
sent money &ndash; enough to pay the mortgage payments for a few months, and put
supplies in here for a while. I said that downstairs because I don't want them
trying to sponge off us for a while &ndash; they'd figure it out soon enough, but
until they do... hey, get out of here! Some of us want to change clothes, and
have some actual modesty or shame!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>A sheepish look went across
Trent's face. "Sorry."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>He closed the door behind him
and Jane turned away, balling up the forged letter as she did so. She tossed
the letter towards the trash can when an overwhelming burst of pure white light
flowed from the closet, filling Jane's room and forcing her to cover her eyes.
"Damn &ndash; I knew guacamole on those burritos tasted funny!" Jane groused, tossing
her paintbrush aside. "Well, at least it's a white light... I wonder - if you're
a virgin when you die, is having sex in Heaven a sin?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>An amused &ndash; and very familiar -
voice spoke from within the light. "You're not dead." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I'm not dead? Really?" Jane
picked up her brush from the floor, and threw it at the light. "Then turn off
the damned light &ndash; you could blind somebody!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The light bled away, and Jane
stared at the exact duplicate of her in the closet.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>, who "Yes &ndash; I'm another reality's version of you," she said,
smirking as she looked her double over. "No, I'm not evil or trying to get into
your pants &ndash; I don't have time for that anyway. Yes, I know that you can defend
yourself because of the powers that Robert Nelson &ndash; the version you know &ndash; gave
you powers. That's partly why I'm here."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane looked at her double.
"Listening."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The alternate Jane held out her
right hand, to show her the ring she had sitting on her palm. "Recognize this?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You know that I do. Robert has
one like it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"No, he doesn't. <i>Nobody</i>
has a Ring like this one. <i>Take it</i>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane hesitated. "But &ndash; Robert
said &ndash; won't I have to tell him &ndash; I can't hide this from Daria-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Listen up, Lane," the
alternate Jane said. "This is not just an ordinary Defender Ring &ndash; it's not
even one of the First Rings, the ones that the first Ringbearers wore &ndash; <i>this
is <u>the</u> First Ring...the very first one created by the Ringmasters, <u>ever</u>.</i>"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span></i>"Why me?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Because this Ring will help
you," was the answer. "This Ring was the prototype &ndash; it has more power than the
others, it can do things that the others can't because the Ringmasters decided
the other Rings didn't need those endowments... or shouldn't have them. This Ring
can't be detected by any of the others, and when you wear it, the ability you
have to &ndash; it's called a 'Glamour' &ndash; your Glamours, as far as anyone else is
concerned, are <i><u>perfect</u></i>. Perfect invisibility &ndash; you can't be
detected even by a telepath, people with <u>specific</u> anti-cloaking powers
or spells, physical contact &ndash; <i><u>nothing will penetrate your Glamours</u></i>.
You won't make footprints, or waves if you're swimming, or if you fart, they
won't notice until you leave the area. If you duplicate someone else, <i>nobody</i>
will be able to tell you apart &ndash; a telepath will only read exactly what they
expect to read off you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Cool."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Oh, and you know how Robert
gave you powers with his Ring?" The alternate Jane nodded. "As soon as you put
this on, it also gives you powers beyond the Ring &ndash; as far as they've figured,
your powers should double in strength. Stronger TK, greater levels with your
elemental affinity, any you'll fly faster and better than almost anybody with a
Ring &ndash; once you get used to it. Even Superman had to learn how to fly."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Like I said &ndash; why me?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The other Jane sighed. "Because
you and Daria have a connection &ndash; a connection more powerful than you can
imagine. It's so powerful that the place you two actually met for the first
time is a nexus - a focal point for more worlds and realities than you can
imagine &ndash; and if you're anything like me, that's a lot of worlds. It's what
they call a non-transitable nexus &ndash; that means that people can't cross through
it from one reality to another &ndash; but rather, it's a point from which all other
realities spring from. In the case of your reality, it's the one single point
that ALL realities focus and generate from."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She took the ring and placed it
in Jane's hand. "The day is coming &ndash; maybe not tomorrow, and maybe not for
years to come &ndash; but the day will come when Daria needs help. That Ring will
help you save her &ndash; and in the process, that Ring may be the way to save more
universes than you can imagine."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane looked at the Ring in her
hand. "I need to sit down."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Here, have a sip of this," the
other Jane said, handing her what looked like a thermos; Jane tasted the fluid,
and her eyes flew open. "Whoa! How do you make coffee that strong?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Another Jane in another
universe asked almost the exact same question when she tasted it for the first
time," the alternate Jane said, smiling. "Keep the thermos. It'll never wear
out, you'll never be able to lose it &ndash; it'll always show up when you need it,
and it'll always have whatever you need or want to drink inside. Robert told
you about nectar and ambrosia, right?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane nodded. "This will always
produce it for you &ndash; anything liquid-based can be poured from this &ndash; cold
fluids and drinks, soups, stews, gravy, you get the point. It'll also work only
for you &ndash; safety measure, unless you tell it to work for someone or it needs to
work for them to feed you because you're sick or something."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The two Janes smiled at each
other. "Oh, by the way &ndash; 11:02 p.m., the day I moved into my dorm in college.
Turned out my roommate got the opportunity of a lifetime, so she decided to
withdraw from college and I had a room to myself. My R.A. helped me move in &ndash;
and then, spent the next hour and a half showing me around the bed. Totally
tore up my sheets, so she gave me a set of hers. 800 thread count, and they're
so soft..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"She?" Jane's eyes flew open. "<i><u>Her</u></i>
sheets?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Stepford Menzies &ndash; world-class
blueblood, math major, and championship-level gymnast." Jane laughed at the
look at her doppelganger's face. "Plus, she's <i><u>really</u></i> hot. Oh,
come on, Jane. We're basically the same person. I know what you did for that
'failure' assignment O'Neill gave you after you left the cheerleading squad &ndash;
or about what our double on another world did when she was triplicated one
time. I know how you've taken the occasional extra look at the girls in the
Fashion Club-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The alternate Jane leaned in
close. "I won't tell about that time you were waiting for Daria to come back
and you saw Stacy and Quinn changing in her room &ndash; that was rug burn material
for weeks, hmm? Don't worry - I know you're not a lesbian, not as if there's
anything wrong with that - but I've got it from on high that you're, well,
'straight but curious."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane looked at her alter.
"Really? It's not, like, weird, or anything? I mean, having thoughts like that
on occasion?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Almost everyone does on
occasion &ndash; Jay and Silent Bob did that 'guys we'd go gay for' thing, remember?
&ndash; and Angelina Jolie's career is half-based on women fantasizing about her!"
The alternate Jane shrugged. "On the flip side, you should see Daria as a boy &ndash;
his name's Darius, and he is... <i>very</i> easy on the eyes..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Really? What about that
Sheridan girl?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Five-foot-seven, almost all of
that is legs, has no shame whatsoever and is very, very bendy &ndash; trust me, you
will not be worried about what people think if you happen to meet your world's
version of her!" The alternate Jane laughed. "Oh, and by the way &ndash; stop
worrying about the mortgage and the bills. I popped by every place that needed
to be paid off, and you and Trent are all set. God... I love him, but he's a
loser in all but one reality I've seen him in. I also set up new accounts for
you at Lawndale First Securities and Loan &ndash; remember, they're the bank Robert
told you about, where folks like us can go to bank without too many questions?
You've got two hundred and fifty big ones in both checking and savings. Between
that and your Ring, you'll never have to worry about money again, and I know
you're not fool enough to attract notice by getting all sorts of expensive things
all of a sudden."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I like girls and boys?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Not if you don't want to. Yes,
people are born with preferences, but you don't have to exercise them, right?
Oh, but if you do, I've got three words for you. 'The Lord Voldemort.' Everyone
loves that. You'll never have a bad breakup if you do that &ndash; or the 'Dominican
Face Hat.' Only ten persons in a couple of realities know that one-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Hey, wait a minute &ndash; I know
that!" The alternate Jane sat back on the bed and smiled as Jane hopped up,
recognition in her eyes. "That old show on FOX with Jay Mohr &ndash; <i>'Action!'</i>
That woman who worked with him made that up to get the writer working on that
script!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Yes &ndash; but in every reality,
things change. In one universe, that was very real &ndash; a universe I just happened
to be in so I could wipe out a band of demons that looked like children's
puppets. Do you know how many demon-touched universes that the writers at the
FOX network have tapped into since 1997 for story ideas &ndash; not to mention how
busy we've been for the past four years since that show with the cute
Winchester brothers came on the air? Television. It's like a New Frontier for
evil."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane reached out, took the
offered Ring, and slid it onto her finger. "Doesn't feel any different."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"It never does," was her
double's reply. "Now, you'll need to take a few weeks off-world for training-" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Schedule it during the summer
&ndash; I can say I'm going to a nice art camp." Jane looked at her ring, and then to
her double. "What about this 'Lord Voldemort' thing...?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>An hour later, a still-hungry
Max walked down the hall to Jane's room as he chewed on a ham sandwich. Without
knocking, he opened the door and walked straight in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>His eyes went wide at the flash
of blue light that almost blinded him, and he backed out quickly, closing the
door as he went. The drummer felt something cold and heavy in his back pocket,
and his eyes went wide as he saw that his drumsticks, poking out of his back
pocket, had been changed into solid gold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Max was not as slow as most
people would have believed. Figuring that the gold was both a bribe to keep
quiet and a warning to what would happen if he didn't, he quickly bounced down
the stairs and out the front door to the <i>Tank. I always knew that Jane was a
witch,</i> he thought, driving off in the direction of the local pawn ship. <i>Even
if I get only the price for their weight in gold, I'll have some bucks for this
&ndash; and I'll be quiet, too</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'>That was kind of weird,
though. It was really hot, but still kind of weird. I'd have figured that she'd
cast some kind of spell so she could do it with Jesse, or her friend Daria's
sister - the prom queen. Hey, if Jane wants to stop driving stick for a while,
that's cool, but still...what she was doing &ndash; is that being a lesbian, or do you
call that just playing with yourself?</p>
