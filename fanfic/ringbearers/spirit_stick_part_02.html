<h3>Part 2</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Five minutes later, the soldier and the blonde woman stood
in the back yard of the Pi Rho Omega sorority house, looking up at the
impressive, three-story building. <span class=GramE>"Yeah.</span> This is not
going to be pleasant," the woman said, holding up her right hand as the simple
silver band on her ring finger began to pulse with a series of slow, steady
blue flashes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Let's throw up some cover, <span class=SpellE>Valkryie</span>,"
the Black soldier said, a low blue glow appearing around the ring he wore. "We
don't need the locals whining about what's happened, and I know that you don't
like screwing with memories."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Let's not go there, <st1:place w:st="on">Archangel</st1:place>,"
she replied, the light around her Defender Ring now matching that of her fellow
Ringbearer. "The glamour's been established around the sorority house and the
immediate yard. All of the locals just saw the two of us walking right inside
the house without a fuss &ndash; and I didn't even draw my sidearm."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"As if standard rounds could hurt most of the things that we
deal with," <st1:place w:st="on">Archangel</st1:place> said. "Am I reading
things wrong &ndash; or did the temperature in that house just drop by sixty-five
degrees?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You're not wrong," the blonde echoed, her hand opening as a
rock the size of a golf ball leaped from the ground to her hand. "I hate
dealing with ephemerals and r<span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>evenants
- and you know that this isn't going to be just a low-level haunting. It's <i><u>never</u></i>
just a low-level haunting."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Valkryie</span> focused the power of her
Ring on the stone, and watched as it transmuted from stone into a clear quartz
crystal. "Okay. Let's see just how bad it's going to be. Open the door."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The heavy, ornate front entrance doors of the sorority
slowly opened as <st1:place w:st="on">Archangel</st1:place> used his
telekinetic power; <span class=SpellE>Valkryie</span> sent the crystal flying
through the open doorway with a graceful throw-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-and immediately shrieked as a heavy bolt of lightning
lanced out through the opening to drive her to her knees, setting her clothes
and hair on fire as the door slammed shut!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Priscilla-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm okay," the Ringbearer said, using her Ring's power to
instantly heal her hideous burns while also dampening down the pain. "I told
you that it wouldn't be easy."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah &ndash; but at least now we know that it's a newborn," her
partner said, restoring the damaged clothing from the scorched scraps around <span
class=SpellE>Valkryie's</span> feet. "Anything really dangerous would have
ignored that crystal &ndash; that bolt was an instinctive reaction."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You can quit with the 'Well, As You Know...' speech," <span
class=SpellE>Valkryie</span> huffed, rising to her feet. "I'm not a newbie
that's impressed by how much you know about ghosts." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Remind me to say something along those lines the next time
there's a cinematic running loose and they call you in specifically to deal
with it," Archangel smirked, recalling the young woman's encyclopedic knowledge
of horror films &ndash; and how she was considered an expert on dealing with those
beings, which actually existed in other realities and occasionally found a way
to slip over to other worlds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Ha, ha," she retorted, as she finished transmuting the last
of seven large rocks into crystals. "Let's seal the area so nothing runs off
once we start busting heads. I'll set these while you start running thread."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on">Archangel</st1:place> nodded; as he
walked away, a bolt of reddish-yellow flame leaped from <span class=SpellE>Valkryie's</span>
Ring, curving slowly as it seemed to be drawn into the crystal she had just
placed on the ground. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The crystal glowed momentarily with a pure white light, and
then sat still. "Okay &ndash; that one's primed," she said to herself. "One set, six
to go."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>*****</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The air inside the foyer of the Pi Rho Omega sorority house
was unnaturally still as the door opened, and the two Ringbearers stepped
across the threshold. "Engage shields," <st1:place w:st="on">Archangel</st1:place>
ordered; as he spoke, twin ovals of barely-visible blue energy surrounded the
two, flickering slightly as they walked through the area. "Scan for signs of
life."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Nothing," <span class=SpellE>Valkryie</span> echoed. "I'm
not even picking up any traces of human remains. Not good."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on">Archangel</st1:place> looked around the
foyer before looking over the large stairwell that led up to the second floor,
and the large hallway overlooked the foyer. "Fine &ndash; we're not going to dick
around here. Start tracking this thing and let's get rid of it. If it killed
eight cops and God knows how many civilian girls, I'm not going to be in a mood
to simply banish it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah, about that, tough guy &ndash; look over here," <span
class=SpellE>Valkryie</span> spoke up, her footsteps raising small puffs of
dust as she walked across a lush carpet to the closed double doors that
separated the foyer from the rest of the house. "I'm picking up a serious
temporal flux on the other side of this door &ndash; and when I expand my scan, the
entire house is like this."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She noticed the dust rising into the air. "Look at this
carpet &ndash; it's as if it hasn't been vacuumed in a couple of months. Every room
exists in a different period of time &ndash; and it seems like the disturbance is
spreading and multiplying, with different time zones even in the same room. We
probably entered a different time as soon as we entered the house."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Q-P link," <st1:place w:st="on">Archangel</st1:place> said
without hesitation; he walked quickly to his fellow Ringbearer, brought his
ring hand up, and a thick band of energy appeared for a brief instant between
both Rings.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>"In case we get separated."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, and I'll be sure to let you out of my sight," <span
class=SpellE>Valkryie</span> said, rolling her eyes. <span class=GramE>"A woman
who looks like me, walking around in a haunted sorority house?</span> If I
didn't have this Ring, I wouldn't have made it across the foyer."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, you would have," said <st1:place w:st="on">Archangel</st1:place>,
a smile spreading across his face. "How old are you &ndash; thirty-three?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Very funny," the blonde huffed. "I'm twenty-six &ndash; and how
many times have I had to go in somewhere as a co-ed?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Okay, so you kept your looks, old lady. Let's go."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two Ringbearers opened the double doors, hesitated for a
moment before taking a step forward...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They went through the doorway &ndash; and disappeared from view.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>*****</p>
