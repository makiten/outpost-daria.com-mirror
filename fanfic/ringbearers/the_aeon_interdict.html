<br>
<i>(NOTE: This is a follow-up to the <u>Daylight</u> fic A Good Deed Repaid.)</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It was fifteen months since the apocalypse known as <i>Zero Hour</i> killed off
over five and a half billion human beings. <br>
<br>
Claire Defoe, following the advice of the friend who had gifted her with her <i>Defender
Ring</i>, wisely remained hidden for the most part, using her 'glamour' to stay
unseen while she did good deeds with her powers. <br>
<br>
Healing children from under cover (and transforming aspirin and other medicines
into <i>'panacea'</i> &ndash; a lower-grade form of healing medicine) to help others,
clearing toxins from fields and skies, in one case, replenishing an underground
water source... <br>
<br>
Claire spent as much time as possible helping people rebuild their communities
and their lives - and, or course, avoiding the many superhumans that had popped
up, such as the many U.S. Marshals (dodging them was a task) and <i>Arcana</i>
- those people who had saved Las Vegas, but also made it into their capital
city as they planned to take over what was left of the world. <i>Those people,
I stay away from - as far as possible.</i><br>
<br>
It hurt, Claire admitted to herself, to sometimes be on the surface, away from
the underground lair where she and her family lived, and look up at the quarry
and see <i>Legion Tower</i> standing... <i>the only remaining building of
modern design in the United States east of Indiana, where that government
academy somehow survived what happened - the academy where the super-kids are...
super kids like the Legionnaires. I didn't see that - but apparently, Anthony <u>did</u>.</i><br>
<br>
Claire walked along the left side of the football field-sized garden that she
had created a year ago, using her Ring, and her elemental affinity of Air.
Creating gentle rains, maintaining a constant, appropriate temperature,
infusing the correct minerals into the soil; it was the most beautiful garden
she had ever created.<br>
<br>
<i>Not to mention that it provides healthy meals for Anthony,</i> she thought,
thinking of her husband, also saved from <i>Zero Hour</i> by Vidalia Johanssen
- the woman who had given her a Ring. <i>I don't mind letting him have the
occasional hamburger or beer - he is a man, after all - but it's better for his
health, especially when we someday break containment and let the people know
that we're here.</i><br>
<br>
<i>I wish I could see the children now</i>, she said, feeling ashamed as she
remembered seeing the battle that took the life of Sandi Griffin, one of the
students she remembered from Lawndale High School. <i>I wish that I could let
you know what I can do, and help all of you start to rebuild the world...</i><br>
<br>
As she turned away from the massive garden, a sharp wave of grief slashed
through Claire as she looked towards the tiny waterfall near the southern end
of the garden - and the grave of Angela Li. <br>
<br>
<i>I wish that I could see you again, Angela,</i> she thought, and with a
thought, used the power of the Ring to dampen her grief. <i>I can't - just like
I can't do any more on the surface than I've been doing. I have a family of my
own to protect...</i><br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
Claire laughed as she watched the three small puppies - new residents of the
lair, she had rescued them a week before and had yet to name them - as they
eagerly gobbled the meal she'd prepared for them. <br>
<br>
<i>When the baby is older, she'll have someone to play with- <u>oh</u>. </i><br>
<br>
In all the time she had the ring, she had never received a message through it &ndash;
which was why the sudden activation of her Ring-shields, and the DRADIS/HUD
displays within, startled her.<br>
<br>

<br>
Claire's shield dropped on its own as something she'd never seen before
happened: a beam of pure white light erupted from her <i>Ring</i>, and a holographic
image of a landmark she'd seen often appeared before her. <br>
<br>
<i>That's the Devil's Tower, out in Wyoming,</i> she thought. Why would someone
broadcast that through the ring &ndash; especially if it's so important that they'd
need &ndash; or want &ndash; to try and get in touch with me?<br>
<br>
A voice spoke from the hologram of the Devil's Tower. <i>"I speak for the <u>Ringmasters</u>,"
</i>the voice rang out, and Claire was shocked as she heard Anthony's vice
speaking to her. <i>"At this moment, I speak to all those who wear the <u>Ring</u>,
wherever you may be."</i><br>
<br>
Claire glanced down to see that the braided strands of ivy etched upon her <i>Ring</i>
that encircled the outside were glowing with a blazing blue light &ndash; and as the
voice of Anthony continued, she realized that she wasn't actually hearing the
words. <br>
<br>
<i>Someone's speaking directly to my mind,</i> she thought. <i>Oh, my.</i><br>
<br>
<i>"Effective immediately, an Interdiction Order has been instituted for the
reality designated as D-2172,"</i> the voice in her head continued. <i>"Under
no circumstances are any <u>Ringbearers</u> to enter that universe. In addition
- under no circumstances, save that of a declared and confirmed <u>Thanos-level</u>
event, are <u>Ringbearers</u> to approach or engage in any form of
communications with this universe, or any travelers from this universe.&quot;</i><br>
<br>
Over the past year, Claire had been studying much about <i>Ringbearer</i> lore
and operations. She had read about the various levels of operations and threats
&ndash; for example, the D-159 infestation was a <i>Thanos-level</i> threat: a threat
that was of such potentially catastrophic potential that beings of other
universes and realities were summoned to assist under the realization that all
realities were in danger from that threat.<br>
<br>
She shuddered as the voice went on. <i>"Should any travelers from this universe
be encountered - save under the conditions listed before - the <u>Ringbearers</u>
present in this encounter shall use their Rings to immediately return those
travelers to their own universe. In the event that <u>Ringbearers</u> are
present at such an encounter while in the jurisdiction of <u>The Agency</u>, they
will immediately communicate the information and provide assistance if
requested. If no such assistance is requested, <u>Ringbearers</u> will
immediately recuse themselves from any further action in whatever operations
they were engaged in - and vacate the area until such time as the situation has
been resolved.&quot;</i><br>
<br>
The voice of her husband spoke once more. <i>"Repeating: An <u>Aeon Interdict</u>
is now in place for D-2172. <b>Under no circumstances are any <u>Ringbearers</u>
to enter that universe."</b></i><br>
<br>
The image of the Devil's Tower faded &ndash; and Claire jumped as she turned away and
saw Anthony standing several steps behind her. "Well, that was something," he
said, more than used to the incredible things that his common-law wife could do
with her <i>Ring</i>. "Why did that woman speak in your voice?"<br>
<br>
Claire went into Anthony's arms, the sudden feeling of comfort that always
covered her like a blanket as he held her close making her feel better. "What
was that all about?"<br>
<br>
"It doesn't matter," Claire said, snuggling against him. "I wasn't going there
anyway. I have more than enough here to keep me busy."</p>
