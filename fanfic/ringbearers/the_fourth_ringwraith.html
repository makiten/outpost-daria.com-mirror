<br>
A <u>Tale of the Ringbearers</u>, by Brother Grimace</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>In the aftermath of the <u>Vengeance Ring Crisis</u>, it was believed that
the Multiverse was free from the threat of the <u>Ringwraiths</u>.
Nevertheless, the Ringmasters acted in this instance as they had never done
before, in order to minimize the possibility of errant Ringwraiths appearing.<br>
<br>
One of their choices was to act as they had never acted before in the
millennium since they anointed themselves Masters of the Ring and sent the
Ringbearers across the Multiverse to destroy the undead; an act only occurring
once before in recorded history (to their knowledge).<br>
<br>
Through unknown means, the alternate Earth where the Lost Corps of Ringbearers
originated is now' time-locked' &ndash; effectively canceling out the existence of
the entirety of the Ringwraiths. This belief was disproved by the revelation
that three Ringwraiths survived the Crisis, by virtue of their being outside
the space-time continuum during the period following the defeat of the <u>Dominator
Ring</u>'s wearer. All efforts are being made towards locating and neutralizing
these weapons &ndash; a task made somewhat simpler in that (due to the corruption of
the 'morality interlock' during the conversion process that corrupts the <u>Defender
Ring</u>), <u>Vengeance Rings</u> can be <u>destroyed</u>. <br>
<br>
It would be foolhardy to believe that no more Ringwraiths exist anywhere in the
Multiverse. To that regard, all Ringbearers have been briefed with the relevant
information necessary to deal with a Ringwraith, should an encounter occur.<br>
<br>
- From a code-word-only report on the <u>Vengeance Ring Crisis</u>, drafted by
a First Ringbearer at the <u>Citadel of the Ringmasters</u>, on Earth (D-476).</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>&quot;But who knows what she spoke to the darkness, alone, in the bitter
watches of the night, when all her life seemed shrinking, and the walls of her
bower closing in about her, a hutch to trammel some wild thing in?&quot;<br>
<br>
&mdash;Gandalf, on &Eacute;owyn, <u>Lord Of The Rings </u></i><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The smell of burning asphalt excited Anastasia Rowe. She didn't understand why,
but it did. <br>
<br>
<i>Oh, yeah! Because I get a lot more people on <u>roads</u>! Stupid idiots &ndash;
they always try to evacuate the cities, and they always clog up all the roads
with lots and lots and lots of scared and angry people...<br>
<br>
I can practically smell the pain and the fear miles and miles and miles away.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
She hit Chicago first. <br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Funny... no matter which Earth I go to, no matter how the natives develop &ndash; as
long as they reach a certain level of tech and social development, somehow,
they <u>always</u> built a Chicago. <br>
<br>
Let's have some fun.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
A massive ring of pink energy appeared in the sky over the city of Chicago; a
ring easily a full mile in diameter, and situated directly over the <i>Chicago
Spire</i> &ndash; the tallest building in North America. <br>
<br>
It was safe to say, as cameras rolled all across the city, transmitting the
image to every corner of the planet, that every eye on Earth was watching.<br>
<br>
A brilliant white shimmer began to iris out from the center of the colossal
ring of energy, filling it &ndash; and after several seconds, the face of Anastasia
Rowe appeared before the world. <br>
<br>
The beautiful young woman was silent for a good ten seconds; then, her face
broke into a beautiful smile that actually made many, many people suddenly feel
calm and at ease &ndash; a feeling that dissipated like vapor as Anastasia spoke her
first words:<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>"Be frightened. I mean you harm." </i><br>
<br>
<br>
Her beautiful smile widened, and Anastasia continued to speak.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>"Our enemies fall, from low and high <br>
<br>
To salted earth, through burning sky <br>
<br>
And all shall know our Ringwraith's cry <br>
<br>
Let Vengeance Ring - and all hope <b>die.</b>"</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A massive pulse of energy suddenly exploded in every direction from the ring,
sweeping through flesh, metal, concrete, glass: a tsunami of force that
reverberated outwards and swept off into the distance. <br>
<br>
In less time than it took to take a breath &ndash; North America had been forced
darkness and chaos.<br>
<br>
The day was January 9th &ndash; a day that would forevermore be known to the
survivors as <i>Arrival Day</i>... the day the <i>Ringwraith</i> came to their
world.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
