<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>A <i>Tale of the Ringbearers </i>by
Brother Grimace</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"It's not uncommon for the
family members and significant others of Ringbearers to have questions about
their loved ones," the woman said, a smile on her face as she sat down at the
dinner table in <i>Schloss</i> Morgendorffer. "Questions that they don't feel
uncomfortable with asking, especially with the covert nature of our work on
most worlds. Little things, or things they think are silly or just
inappropriate to ask."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"So some of you are, what, outreach
workers?" Daria Morgendorffer was still a little star-struck (not to mention
being annoyed at herself for being so) at having a celebrity &ndash; someone who'd
she'd watched on television ever since she was a girl, although she'd NEVER
admit to watching <i>Charmed</i>&ndash; sitting in the kitchen of her family home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Not exactly. Sometimes, people
just need a little more explanation about all of it and don't feel that they
can open up fully. Sometimes, they don't ever realize that's exactly what's
happening, and it causes a bit of stress in the relationship. That's why
someone else comes along and has a conversation, does a bit of a demo on
things, and explains as much as they want to know."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Okay."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"In the Navy, they call this a
'Tiger Cruise' &ndash; you know, when family members get to come aboard the ship and
spend a few days seeing exactly what their loved ones actually do in the
uniform. Usually, Robert would be doing this &ndash; but seeing as how your
relationship is still kind of new, they thought that it would be better for
someone else to show you all of the different things &ndash; that way, you won't hold
it against him if something went wrong, or if he did something to embarrass
you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Hmn. Why you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Well, one of the senior members
asked, and I thought it would be a good chance to actually get to meet the <i><u>real</u></i>
Daria Morgendorffer &ndash; my world is one where you existed only as a cartoon
character on MTV, even though you got a great run. Lifetime picked the show up
the next year and brought a new producer in; some guy named Lobinske. They did
two new seven-episodes miniseries about your first and last summers in
Lawndale, a seven episode 'Season Six', and a year later, started the new
spin-off series &ndash; <i>'Daria: Falling Into College.'</i> It was a big thing, and
they were about to premiere the third season of 'D-Fic' &ndash; that's what the fans
call it - when the world fell in on everyone."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria put her head down on the
kitchen table. "Is there <u>any</u> world where I'm <u>not</u> a cartoon
character <u>or</u> constantly in either more drama that a soap opera or more
action than Indiana Jones?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The woman nodded. "If it's any
consolation &ndash; it turns out that on every Earth I've been to so far, they always
start off by calling me 'Phoebe.' Aaron Spelling is on EVERY Earth in
existence, it seems, and on every one, he's making the same shows. It's kind of
weird; there's a hotel in San Francisco that's also on each Earth you go to, as
well as this old man with a white beard, who's always a cabbie that works in
that neighborhood..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>A look of distaste went across
her face. "Oh, yeah. I've also met a real-life <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><u>Beavis</u></i>, too. From Robert's Earth; he was one of the major
characters on the other show you were in &ndash; <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>'Beavis
and Butt-Head?'</i> God, what a walking hormone - he's always staring at my
'thingies'&quot;. She drank half of the glass of water in her hand. &quot;Even
with the way he chews through Zack, I've always wondered why no one's ever used
their Ring to draw the uranium out of his body and heal the damage done by that
and the drugs his mother was on before he was born &ndash; make him a normal person,
you know?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria sighed, <i>why don't you
do it?</i> quickly disappearing through her mind as she still focused on her
earlier question. "No &ndash; I meant, 'how did <u>you</u> get picked?' For the Ring?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Alyssa Milano smiled. "By sheer
luck. I got my Ring the very first day that the Ringbearers arrived &ndash; and they
showed up just in time to stop the riots and save me, along with a lot of other
people. Los Angeles was one of the last major cities in North America to deal
with Zack infestation &ndash; we don't call them..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The woman shook her head. "We
try not to use that word. Anyway, L.A. was swollen in size &ndash; the city was home
to over twenty million people from all across the continent who were trying to
get away from the threat. The East Coast was overrun with Zack and they had
spread down through Mexico, all the way to the Panama Canal, and up into Canada
&ndash; all the way to Manitoba. People still talk about the 'Burning of the West
Edmonton Mall'." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria's head jerked up as
Alyssa continued on. "The Canadians lit up the entire place and had sound
blasting through 24/7 for two weeks straight to lure as many zombies &ndash; as many
Zack - in as possible &ndash; by the time they were ready, the satellites showed that
they'd lured in over ten million of the things."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>A chill went through Daria. "By
the time they were ready?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"They used neutron bombs &ndash; four
of them. Three went off in a triangle pattern, each six miles away from the
Mall &ndash; and one went directly into the Mall itself. It all but cleared Canada
and the Pacific Northwest of the problem; they had infected, but were smarter,
quicker and way more ruthless about dealing with the problem than anyone else -
even more than the South Africans and the English. Most of the problems they
had were from Americans trying to escape north and taking plague rats with
them, especially through Detroit into Windsor-" Alyssa cleared her throat.
"That's what they called infected people who were hiding it. After the first
Ringbearers arrived, that stopped being a problem because they could detect the
infection and heal them, but before that, Zack traveled around the world that
way, big-time."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria's eyes were very wide.
"How many &ndash; I mean, how-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The attractive young woman went
silent for a moment. "When it was all over... just under four billion people,"
she said. "America was down to just under eighty million &ndash; the West Coast was
the fallback for the people left, and Chicago made it because they became a
walled fortress city VERY fast, stockpiled like you wouldn't believe and gave
the gangs full amnesty if they would fight &ndash; aside from them, no major city
east of Denver survived. Africa below the equator is doing okay, and most
island nations like Great Britain, Japan and Cuba did the best. Very few
infections and they stomped them out VERY fast. Eastern Europe and all of Asia,
especially Korea and Vietnam - That part of the world's basically a bad memory
now. On our world, people of Asian descent are almost all gone - for some
reason, the virus worked especially fast on them. There's probably less than
five million Chinese citizens in the world."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>There was quiet in the kitchen
for a minute; Alyssa reached for an empty cup on the drain board nest to the
sink. "Let me show you something kind of cool," she said, noticing the way the
blood had drained from Daria's face. "I bet that boyfriend of yours hasn't
shown you any of the fun things that you can do with a Ring. Tasty or kinky?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Her words worked to jar Daria
out of her shocked expression. "What?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Tasty or kinky?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Before she could call the word
back, Daria heard herself say, "Kinky."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I knew that you could be fun,"
Alyssa smiled, setting the cup down on the table. "Besides, this tastes way
better afterwards. Put your hands flat on the table &ndash; and this could be a touch
intense."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Slight disbelief in her eyes,
Daria placed her hands on the table, and as Alyssa did the same, Daria noticed
the woman's Defender Ring for the first time and how it had a very familiar
symbol on it: the symbol on the cover of the <i>Book of Shadows</i>. "It
appeared on the Ring the first time I put it on. "Holly and Rose- the only
major outbreak in the West happened because some producer flew his friends back
from Orlando before they stopped all flights. Too late, though &ndash; between the
Zack and the riots, almost a million people died &ndash; and we got off easy in
California. The Platinum Triangle, Orange County, almost all of the wealthy
areas in Southern California went up in flames... I guess a lot of average people
thought it was the end of the world, so it was 'payback time'. If the
Ringbearers hadn't come when they did, people would have killed each other off
like crazy - and then, the Zack would have overrun the planet."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria watched as Alyssa sat
quietly, running a finger over her Ring.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You still miss them."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Yeah." Alyssa focused her
attention back on Daria. "I do. Oh, but they would have loved this. Ready?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria's palms lay flat upon the
table &ndash; and the young woman felt every muscle in her body suddenly contract as
an incredibly powerful vibration slammed up through her palms and through her
entire body! "<b><i><u>OH</u>!</i></b>" she exhaled harshly, half-gasping and
half-grunting as she felt her entire body coming apart. <i>"</i><i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt'>I-I-<u>aiaiaiaaiaiai</u>... <b>GUH</b>!&quot;</span></i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt'>Alyssa jerked her hand away as if a lightning bolt had hit her, and
Daria, sweat beading off her eyelashes, turned the color of a ripe tomato as
she dragged her hands, clasping open and closed over and over, away from the
table. "What the hell just happened?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt'>"Ohhh, I am <u>so</u> sorry!" Alyssa said, holding up her Ring hand.
"The Rings can create a field that controls all vibration inside it. It was
meant to cancel out the sound of moaning Zack &ndash; that moan's their main weapon
against people &ndash; but people have found a world of other ways to use it. Membership
has its privileges, and I thought that you'd just get a little tingling to show
you how you can have a little naughty fun &ndash; <i>are you all right?</i>"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Unable to even look the
Ringbearer directly in the eye, Daria dashed out of the kitchen and shot
upstairs! "Wow, her entire body is like one total erogenous zone!" Alyssa said,
trying not to snicker as she pointed at the chair where Daria sat. "Robert is
one lucky guy!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The chair glowed with a blue
light for a split-second. "Maybe not. She'll probably kill or cripple him in
bed within an hour &ndash; not that he'll mind. Men are pigs."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Alyssa sat back as a glass,
plate, and several piece of silverware floated over to set down gently in front
of her on the table. "Think I'll have a snack while she's making herself
presentable."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The smell of freshly baked
foods drew Daria &ndash; still mortified at her reactions to Alyssa's vibration field
&ndash; to poke her head out of the shower. "It smells like turkey and dressing out
here," she said, squinting through the steam and her wet hair. "What did she do
&ndash; open a portal up to Thanksgiving Day?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Ten minutes later, Daria
returned to the kitchen to find a spectacular dinner waiting for her on the
kitchen table! "All right &ndash; how did you do that?" she asked, her embarrassment
at what happened earlier disappearing as she breathed in the heady scent of
sage-laced dressing filled with finely-chopped vegetables, a thick, steaming
gravy in a beautiful gravy boat made of a beautiful heavy glass, just like the
rest of the serving dishes (each filled with delicious looking foods, and a
large, heavy turkey that looked as though it had just came out of an oven &ndash; or
right off one of those cooking shows on the Food Network during their 'Seasons
Eating' shows around Christmas time, she thought.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I have friends who were really
good cooks," Alyssa said, smiling as she carved a large, juicy slice of turkey
breast and placed it on a plate, then passed it over to Daria. "Have a seat. I
guess I should have demonstrated 'tasty' first, you think?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>As Daria sat down, Alyssa
spooned dressing, mashed potatoes and gravy, cranberry sauce and corn upon her
plate. "I thought that this might make a bigger impression that pizza or
lasagna," she said, taking a bite of dressing from her own plate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria took a bite of her
potatoes and gravy, and her eyes widened at the taste. "This is &ndash; I mean &ndash; this
is it tastes so, so good!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I wasn't sure if Robert had
shown you all of the things that the Ring can do, or some of the more unusual
things. Tell me &ndash; have you ever heard of 'ambrosia'?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Finishing a forkful of turkey
and dressing before she spoke, Daria nodded. "It's from Greek mythology &ndash;no.
You guys can make <i><u>that</u></i>?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Alyssa sat an empty saucer next
to Daria's plate. "Well, the stuff from mythology is just that &ndash; but like a lot
of things people wrote about in the past, it was based on things that did
exist." She looked around the kitchen as Daria watched her with curious
interest, until her eyes settled on a wadded-up piece of newspaper lying next
to the garbage can. "That'll work."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The newspaper rose from the
floor and effortlessly glided over to rest in the center of the saucer. "Robert
probably told you about how Ringbearers don't have to work because they can
transmute things to get money &ndash; gold, diamonds, silk and glass of superior
quality, this glassware is probably worth a couple of thousand dollars &ndash; but
did he tell you that we really don't need money to eat?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>A blue glow covered the
newspaper, and it changed before Daria's eyes into a solid, gelatin-like block
the size of a deck of playing cards. "Nice color, too," Alyssa said, as Daria
held up the saucer to look closely at the way the clear, blue substance barely
moved when she shook the saucer gently. "It's about the same consistency as
tofu &ndash; and tastes just as bland. You can eat it and easily survive on it &ndash; but
I wouldn't advise it. Better to think of something better. Seriously."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Pardon me?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"What would you like for
dessert? Just think of anything that you'd really enjoy."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria concentrated for a moment
&ndash; and cried out in surprise as the ambrosia transformed instantly into a
three-layered delight of thinly-sliced strawberries on warm slices of pound
cake, with whipped cream liberally covering the dessert!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Not bad," the dark haired woman said,
sitting back. "Ambrosia's psycho-active; it forms itself into whatever you want
it to be, but the catch is that you have to have had whatever you want before,
even if it was just once and even if you only had just a taste of it. With
ambrosia and nectar and enough Ringbearers, you can feed everybody in a city.
We did, too &ndash; on a number of occasions."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Alyssa held up her ring, and
the glass next to Daria instantly filled with a clear fluid. "Pick it up, close
your eyes and imagine what you'd like to be drinking before you taste it," she
said, as Daria reached for the glass. "Think of something... exotic."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria concentrated; she put the
glass to her lips, and her eyes flew open as she instantly recognized the
taste. "This &ndash; it's the champagne that they served at my cousin Erin's wedding
&ndash; the champagne my mother nagged about all the way home because it was so
expensive and Quinn whined about because Mom and Dad wouldn't let her have
any!" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"May I?" Alyssa took the
offered glass, and her eyes went wide in as the taste of the sparkling wine
captured her senses. "Wow. Your family has very good taste in bubbly."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She passed the glass back.
"Nectar's just like ambrosia; it can become any drink you want it to be, but
you can save ambrosia practically forever if you freeze it. Nectar evaporates
after 24 hours, no matter how you try to store it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria sipped again at the
sparkling wine, and then started back on her food. "What else can that Ring do,
food-wise?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I don't think you're ready for
<i>aqua vitae</i> just yet," Alyssa chuckled, "unless you've got a family
friend who's a moonshiner and let you sample the goods. The word when it comes
to that stuff is 'Sip'. Slowly. Just a bit. It WILL knock you out of your chair,
out of your reality, or out of your clothes." She leaned in over the table. "My
advice to you about the stuff? If you and Robert ever drink it, be in a
honeymoon suite, on Spring Break at the time OR have him put up the vibe-field
around his apartment &ndash; otherwise, you're going to have everyone in earshot
thinking he's murdering you with a chainsaw and a Bowie knife."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The blush that went through
Daria made Alyssa change gears quickly. "Let me make it up to you for the
embarrassment. Is there anywhere you've ever wanted to go before &ndash; <i>anywhere</i>
in the world?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You mean, through the
portals?" Daria shook her head. "I thought that you couldn't go that far before
you went off course &ndash; way off course. Robert said something about ending up in
a girl's shower room at Baylor, I think he said..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"That's 'traveling through
shadow'," Alyssa said. "I'm talking about 'portals' &ndash; and once you've got a
really solid feel for it, you can access any point in time and space that any
other Ringbearer has ever been to. Do you have any idea on exactly how easy it
is to get to Woodstock if you've got one of these Rings? Woodstock, Krakatoa,
Charles and Diana's wedding, the NBA game where Michael Jordan hit Boston for
sixty-some points &ndash; those spots might as well be Ringbearer conventions. One
thing. Do not freak when you meet yourself &ndash; because sooner or later, you <u>will</u>
- and be careful of what you drink. Waking up in bed with yourself is a very
strange experience."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She held up a hand to stave off
the incoming question. <i>"Don't ask."<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Alyssa stood up, and fashioned
a beautiful glass bottle out of the dust in the air. "Robert told you about how
we all have an elemental affinity, right?" As Daria nodded, she added a few
gentle touches to the bottle, and then concentrated, allowing it to fill with
nectar before changing it to the champagne Daria created earlier. "My affinity
is Earth; it allows me to work with the- oh, hell, the short form is that I'm
one hell of a glassmaker. One way that I make money - now that the acting thing's
not that important - is making one-of- a-kind glassware sets. This should
impress any family visitors that ever come over with snotty attitudes."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She turned to the countertop,
and Daria's eyes narrowed as the area was filled with exquisite glassware! "Stop
trying to impress me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>A sigh escaped Alyssa as she
turned to Daria. "Earlier, you asked why I was here &ndash; well, you asked me how I
got my Ring, but it was still a decent question. I watched every episode of
your show &ndash; both series &ndash; and watching, I always said that if I ever had the
chance to talk to you, there's a couple of things that I'd say."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria's temper flared. "Like
what?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Like how, if someone gives you
a gift or does something for you &ndash; stop being bitchy about it or thinking that
they're up to no good or trying to 'change you'," she shot back. "Just &ndash; just
realize that people are trying to get you to smile. Just say 'thank you' and
accept the gift with a little grace. People want you to be happy."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Remembering how she acted when
Robert changed a rose into gold and gave it to her, Daria felt her anger bleed
away. "Um, yeah, I guess so," she said. "What's all the champagne for?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Alyssa fashioned a silver ice
bucket out of a Styrofoam container from the Good Time Chinese restaurant, and
as Daria watched (mildly impressed at how simple Alyssa made it all seem), she
used her powers to chill the bottle thoroughly before filling the bucket with
ice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Well, it's great with the meal,"
she said, putting the bottle in the bucket, "and this way, there's enough for
everyone." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The twinkling in her eye
reminded Daria all too much of her younger sister, Quinn. "What's going on,
Alyssa?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Before Alyssa could answer, a
large, gleaming purplish-white ring of energy appeared in the kitchen behind
them, and Daria's voice caught in her throat as she saw Robert Nelson, Jane
Lane &ndash; <i>and an exact double of herself</i> &ndash; step through the ring. "Hey, <i>amiga</i>!"
Jane said, nodding to the first Daria as she slid over to the table and started
digging in. "I've been waiting for this! I've had the munchies for almost
thirty years!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The second Daria turned and
looked at the first. "Don't ask. You'll find out soon enough," she said, before
turning to Alyssa. "Thanks for showing me around."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"No problem," Alyssa said,
creating another ring of energy in the air. "Well, let's go. Time to show you
what the Ring can do."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria shrugged, walked through
the ring with Alyssa, and the ring disappeared behind them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Man, there's one thing I've
gotta say about her," Jane said through a mouthful of potatoes and corn. "I
never did like her show, but man, can she cook!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Oh, please," Daria said,
sitting down at her plate "You liked her because she gave you a gallon of <i>aqua
vitae</i>, and because you won that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>'67
Corvette off those guys for drinking them under the table. Where is it,
anyway?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I portaled it to her
driveway," Robert said, barely looking up from his turkey leg. "Don't think
you're going to start a business as an antiques dealer, either. There's a
Ringbearer in Central Illinois who's pulling that one off on this Earth, and we
try not to step on each other's toes when it comes to how we make money."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Tell you what," Jane said, a
playful gleam in her eye. "You don't tell me about cars, and I won't ever ask
if you and Daria have been experimenting with your vibration field."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The looks on the faces of her
