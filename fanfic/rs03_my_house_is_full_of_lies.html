<center><b>My House is Full of Lies</b>
<p>by Corvus Marinus

<p>“Hey, Daria.”&nbsp; Jodie Landon looked around to make sure there was
no one within earshot.&nbsp; “Do you mind if I ask you something a little
personal?”
<p>“That depends.&nbsp; If it concerns my family, you’ll have to clear
it with the Federal Witness Protection Program.”
<p>“It’s not about your family.”&nbsp; She frowned.&nbsp; “I hate to pry,
but the other day I saw you, Jane, and Sandi Griffin in the Pizza King
together.&nbsp; What’s going on?”
<p>“We were eating pizza.&nbsp; Is there a problem?”
<p>“Come on.&nbsp; When you and Jane start hanging out with the President
of the Fashion Club, something strange is going on.”
<p>Daria sighed.&nbsp; “Ex-President.&nbsp; Sandi resigned so she could
be friends with Jane.”
<p>“You’re kidding.”
<p>“I hope you don’t think I could make up something like that.”
<p>“There has to be more to it.&nbsp; I mean, it just doesn’t make sense.”
<p>“Tell me about it.”&nbsp; Daria shrugged.&nbsp; “Jane ran into her by
accident one day, they had a conversation, and…they like each other.&nbsp;
They’re practically inseparable.”
<p>“How are you dealing with it?”
<p>“Withdrawal.&nbsp; Denial.&nbsp; The usual.”
<p>“Come on, Daria.&nbsp; Seriously.”
<p>“Seriously, she seems to like Jane better than she likes fashion.&nbsp;
And…well…she’s not quite as obnoxious to be around as I thought she’d be.”
<p>“So she doesn’t treat you like a big loser any more?”
<p>Daria shook her head.&nbsp; “I think she thinks I’m cool because I’m
Jane’s friend.”
<p>“That’s seriously weird.”&nbsp; Jodie shook her head.&nbsp; “Jane’s
not going to start wearing hair scrunchies, is she?&nbsp; It just makes
me think of that time she almost became a cheerleader.”
<p>“Nothing like that is going to happen.”
<p>“Are you sure?”
<p>Daria’s expression changed to a worried frown.&nbsp; “No.&nbsp; But
if it does happen, someone’s going to die.”
<p>“What about Mrs. Griffin?&nbsp; How’s she taking it?”
<p>“I don’t even know if she knows about it.”
<p>“Yeah…if I were Sandi, I sure wouldn’t tell her.”&nbsp; Jodie frowned.&nbsp;
“I imagine she’s going to find out sooner or later, though.&nbsp; Um…you
might want to tell Jane to watch out.”
<center>

<p>Linda Griffin frowned.&nbsp; “It seems to me you haven’t been going
on very many dates lately, Sandi.”
<p>“I’ve been going on plenty of dates, mother.&nbsp; I hope you don’t
think I gave up my popularity when I resigned from the Fashion Club.”
<p>“You haven’t been getting very many calls from boys, though.”
<p>“I talk to them at school.&nbsp; I prefer not to have them call the
house ever since my brat brothers decided to start answering the phone
and harassing them.&nbsp; I don’t see why we can’t do something about that.”
<p>“So you do have a date for this Saturday?”
<p>“Of course.”
<p>“All right then.”&nbsp; Linda walked away.&nbsp; Sandi looked after
her, worrying about the conversation.&nbsp; Linda had been asking about
Sandi’s personal life more and more often, and Sandi understood perfectly
well why her mother was concerned.&nbsp; Worse, Sandi had lied; she’d been
going on fewer and fewer dates, and spending more and more time with Jane
and Heidi.&nbsp; She could hardly tell Linda that.&nbsp; And now she had
to make a date for Saturday, and do it fast.&nbsp; She hurried up to her
room and called Quinn.
<p>“Sandi! Hi! It’s great to hear from you!”
<p>“Thank you.&nbsp; Um, Quinn, I have a little problem that I was hoping
you might be able to help me with…”
<p>“You know I’d do anything to help you, Sandi.&nbsp; Um…what is it?”
<p><i>God, this is embarrassing.</i> “I…was wondering if you could…help
me get a date for Saturday.”&nbsp; There was a prolonged silence on the
other end.&nbsp; “Quinn?&nbsp; Hello?”
<p>“Um…okay…are you really sure you need my help?”
<p>“Well, it’s just that I’ve kind of lost track of who’s dating who, and
I don’t want to unnecessarily embarrass anyone by asking out like their
boyfriend or anything.&nbsp; And you being the President now, you naturally
have all that knowledge at your fingertips.&nbsp; Of course, if you don’t
<i>want</i>
to help me…”
<p>“It’s no problem or anything…I was just kind of surprised, that’s all.”
<p>“All right, I’ll overlook it this time…” Sandi suddenly realized that
she had fallen back into her standard Quinn-bashing mode.&nbsp; “Oh God,
Quinn, I’m sorry!&nbsp; I’m just kind of not myself today.”&nbsp; <i>Or
too much of myself!</i>&nbsp; “I really appreciate your helping me out
in this matter.”
<p>“Sure…what should I do?”
<p>“Well, you know the kind of boys I find suitable for dating.&nbsp; If
you could just find one who’s free and let me know, I’ll take care of the
rest.&nbsp; Um…it’s probably better if you don’t call me here with the
information.&nbsp; If you could give it to me tomorrow morning at school,
that would be good.”
<p>“Sure, Sandi.”
<p>“Thanks so much.&nbsp; Um…I’ll talk to you later.&nbsp; Bye, Quinn.”
<p>“Bye, Sandi.”&nbsp; Quinn hung up and unsuccessfully tried to figure
out what had just happened.&nbsp; All she could come up with was that it
was really, really weird.
<center>
<p>3.</center>

<p>“Hey!&nbsp; How is everything, Sandi?&nbsp; It’s been a while since
I’m seeing you.”&nbsp; Heidi came down the hall, wearing a skirt and stockings
instead of her usual slacks.
<p>“Hi!”&nbsp; Sandi smiled; she and Heidi had gone to the Pizza King only
two days earlier.&nbsp; “I guess it has been a while.&nbsp; I’m fine.&nbsp;
I like your outfit!&nbsp; It’s kind of a different look for you.”
<p>“Thank you!&nbsp; I’m trying a little bit different look.&nbsp; You
think it’s good?”
<p>Sandi nodded. “It’s really cute.&nbsp; I like your blouse, too.&nbsp;
The color is the perfect complement for your hair.”
<p>“I’m inspired to pick out my clothes a little more carefully now.”
<p>Sandi noted that Heidi was still wearing her clogs; she was surprised
to find herself relieved.&nbsp; “Um…you didn’t change your look because
of me, did you?”
<p>“Don’t you like it? You said you liked it.”
<p>“I do like it, I mean, I would never lie about that.&nbsp; I was just
concerned that maybe you thought…um…that I didn’t like the way you looked
before.&nbsp; Because, you know, you were already really cute.”
<p>Heidi smiled warmly.&nbsp; “Thank you.&nbsp; But I like a new look sometimes,
too.”
<p>“Okay.&nbsp; And it is a really good look for you.&nbsp; Did you get
that at Cashman’s?”
<p>“Yes, I’m going there yesterday to shop.”
<p>Sandi chuckled.&nbsp; “It’s so cute the way you say things sometimes.&nbsp;
Um…the next time you want to go to Cashman’s, let me know.&nbsp; I’m like
the Cashman’s expert.&nbsp; I’ll be glad to go shopping with you.”
<p>“All right, it is a date!”&nbsp; Heidi smiled and walked off as Quinn
came walking up.
<p>“Hi Sandi, um, how’s your friend?”
<p>“She’s all right…I guess.&nbsp; It’s kind of hard to tell sometimes,
you know, with her being foreign and whatever.”
<p>“That’s a really cute outfit she’s wearing, except for—” Quinn managed
to stop before the word “clogs” escaped her lips.&nbsp; “Um, I mean, it’s
like…”
<p>“You don’t have to change your opinion of her footwear simply because
I did.”&nbsp; Sandi smiled.&nbsp; “But thank you for taking my feelings
into consideration.”
<p>“Um…you’re welcome.”
<p>“Did you have a chance to do that favor I asked for?”
<p>Quinn nodded.&nbsp; “After careful consideration, I narrowed it down
to a choice between Stewart Lattimer and Gordon Parkhurst.”&nbsp; She looked
up nervously to see if these were acceptable; to her relief, they were.
<p>“I’ll talk to Stewart.&nbsp; Thank you so much, Quinn.”
<p>“Don’t mention it.&nbsp; Is…everything all right, Sandi?”
<p>Sandi frowned, but then, to Quinn’s surprise, she reached down and clasped
Quinn’s hand.&nbsp; “I hope so.&nbsp; Thank you for being concerned.”
<center>
<p>4.</center>

<p>Sandi’s parents were waiting up in the living room when she came home.&nbsp;
“Well, how was your date?” said Linda.
<p><i>Oh, God, now what?</i> “It was fine.”
<p>“Stewart Lattimer, was it?”
<p>“What are you doing, spying on me?”
<p>“We’re just concerned about you.”&nbsp; Linda turned to her husband.&nbsp;
“Aren’t we.”
<p>Tom Griffin sighed.&nbsp; “We just want to make sure everything’s all
right, Sandi.”
<p>She scowled.&nbsp; “I told you everything was all right.&nbsp; I don’t
know why you don’t trust me!&nbsp; Why don’t you come along on my next
date and bring a video camera?”
<p>Linda looked at her coldly. “I don’t appreciate that attitude.&nbsp;
Your father and I have legitimate reasons for our concern.”
<p>“You don’t trust me.&nbsp; You’re always concerned that I’m like going
to embarrass you again, and I’m not!&nbsp; I mean, how many years has it
been?”
<p>“This isn’t about us.&nbsp; We’re thinking about you, and your future.”
<p>“I’m touched.&nbsp; It’s too bad you couldn’t show concern like that
when I was lying in my bed puffing up like a balloon.&nbsp; But I guess
you don’t care if I’m the fat chocolate lady of Lawndale as long as I don’t
go out in public!”&nbsp; She stormed off to her room.
<p>Linda turned to Tom. “Thank you <i>so</i> much for your help.”
<center>
<p>5.</center>

<p>“So your parents are like monitoring your dates?”&nbsp; Jane shook her
head.&nbsp; “I can’t imagine what that would be like.&nbsp; I’m still not
sure if my parents ever even <i>knew</i> I was dating Tom.”
<p>“They’ve started making a big deal about it lately.&nbsp; I guess they’re
worried that I’m spending too much time with my friends.”
<p>“Weird.&nbsp; Well, maybe we should get you a steady boyfriend.&nbsp;
That’d keep them off your back.”
<p>Sandi scowled.&nbsp; “I don’t think they’ll be satisfied until I’m married
and have like a hundred kids and whatever.&nbsp; And probably not even
then.”
<p>“Wow.&nbsp; And I thought Mrs. Morgendorffer was giving Daria a hard
time over Tom.”
<p>“Helen would never treat her daughters the way my mother treats me.”&nbsp;
Sandi brightened a little.&nbsp; “Maybe I could switch with Quinn.&nbsp;
I mean, she’d have to put up with my mother, but on the other hand my brothers
would always be at her service.”
<p>“You want to have Daria for an older sister?”
<p>“I wouldn’t mind.”
<p>“Whoa.&nbsp; You really are pissed at your family.”
<p>Daria was unamused when Jane recounted the conversation to her.&nbsp;
“I’m really not sure which is more frightening - the thought of having
Sandi for a sister or the thought that she would want to be part of the
Morgendorffer clan.&nbsp; I take it her mother still doesn’t know she’s
friends with you?”
<p>“Nope.&nbsp; Is Ms. Landon still eagerly anticipating the fireworks?”
<p>“I think she’s just concerned.&nbsp; Um…I think I am, too.”
<p>“I can handle myself.&nbsp; I am kind of worried about Sandi, though.&nbsp;
It really could be bad, Daria.”
<p>Daria grimaced.&nbsp; “Uh…listen. If there’s anything I can do to help
you…or Sandi…I’ll do what I can.”
<p>“Thanks.&nbsp; And don’t think I’m being an ingrate when I say I hope
we don’t have to take you up on that.”
<center>
<p>6.</center>

<p>Sandi got up and opened the door to her room; to her relief, it was
her father standing outside.&nbsp; “Yes?”
<p>“Can I come in for a second?&nbsp; I just…I found this in a box of my
old college stuff in the attic and I thought you might like to have it.”&nbsp;
He came in and handed her a book.&nbsp; She read the title - EDWARD HOPPER
- and looked up at him.
<p>“You wanted me to have this?”
<p>He nodded.
<p>She started leafing through it; it was a beautiful book.&nbsp; “I didn’t
know you ever had a book like this.”&nbsp; She looked up at him again.&nbsp;
“Thanks.”
<p>“You’re welcome.&nbsp; Well…I’m sure you have things to do.”&nbsp; In
the doorway, he turned back to her.&nbsp; “Sandi, I’m sorry about the other
night.”
<p>She nodded slowly.&nbsp; “Okay.”
<p>He glanced into the hallway and looked at her again.&nbsp; “I think
we should trust you.”&nbsp; He sighed.&nbsp; “But…”
<p>“I know.&nbsp; Thanks, dad.”
<p>He stepped out and closed the door.

<p>“I’m just saying, why do we always have to go to Cashman’s?&nbsp; It’s
not like the only store in the country.”&nbsp; Brooke was somewhat taken
aback by the stares she received from the other Fashion Clubbers.
<p>“This is a Fashion Club tradition!” said Quinn.&nbsp; “The Club was
practically founded here.&nbsp; Hey!&nbsp; Maybe we should get like a historical
plaque put in our dressing room.”
<p>“That’s a really great idea, Quinn,” said Tiffany.
<p>“Yeah!” said Stacy.&nbsp; “Except…we’re not going to try to sell newsletters
like the last time, are we?&nbsp; That didn’t work out so well.”
<p>“No, silly, we’ll ask Theresa to donate the plaque on behalf of Cashman’s.&nbsp;
I mean, we’re only like her best customers ever.”&nbsp; Quinn’s eyes narrowed
slightly.&nbsp; “And I’m sure she wants to keep us that way.”
<p>Stacy nodded enthusiastically.&nbsp; “Quinn, you’re the best.”
<p>“Well, I try.&nbsp; But remember, I had a really great role model—”
<p>“Sandi!” shouted Brooke.
<p>“Well, of course,” said Quinn, “I mean who else—” She abruptly realized
that Brooke had just seen Sandi in the store.
<p>“Weren’t we like going to call her before we came here again?” said
Tiffany, as Sandi spotted them and walked over.&nbsp; “This is like embarrassing.”&nbsp;
But Sandi was smiling.
<p>“Hey, how are you all doing?”
<p>“Um, we’re all okay,” said Quinn.&nbsp; “And how are you doing, Sandi?”
<p>“I’m okay.”
<p>“Are you like here by yourself?” said Tiffany.&nbsp; “Ow.”&nbsp; Quinn
had deftly elbowed her.
<p>“Actually, I’m here with Heidi.&nbsp; I’m helping her pick out clothes.”
<p>“Wow, that’s really nice,” said Stacy.&nbsp; “Where is she?”
<p>“Here she comes.”&nbsp; Heidi emerged from a dressing room wearing a
spectacular form-fitting red dress.&nbsp; They all gaped at her.
<p>“Is that like her natural figure?” said Brooke.&nbsp; “Because I’d kill
for hips like that.”
<p>“Sandi,” said Tiffany, “she’s beautiful.”&nbsp; Sandi was speechless.
<p>“Hi!&nbsp; How are you all doing?”&nbsp; Heidi walked over, a little
awkwardly, trying to get used to the feel of the dress.&nbsp; “What do
you think of this?&nbsp; Is this too sexy?”
<p>“It’s perfect,” said Stacy, with tears in her eyes.&nbsp; “It’s so beautiful!”
<p>“Sandi, what are you thinking of the dress?”
<p>Sandi blinked and snapped out of it.&nbsp; “It’s stunning.&nbsp; I mean,
God, you could be like a model or something.”&nbsp; She looked away from
Heidi.&nbsp; “Um…I really need to go and sit down.&nbsp; I’m kind of dizzy…from
being on my feet too much.&nbsp; I’ll be back in a minute.”&nbsp; She sprinted
away, leaving Heidi and the Fashion Club staring.
<p>“That was odd,” said Brooke.&nbsp; “You think she’s all right?”
<p>“She’s not so used to giving compliments, maybe,” said Heidi.&nbsp;
“She’s…what’s the word?…shy?”
<p><i>Shy</i>? Sandi? No way! Quinn tried to guess what word Heidi could
have been thinking of, but she couldn’t come up with anything.&nbsp; Things
were getting weirder.
<center>
<p>8.</center>

<p>Jane opened the door.&nbsp; Linda Griffin looked her over.&nbsp; “I
suppose you’re Jane?&nbsp; You don’t look like a Heidi.”
<p>“Good call,” said Jane.&nbsp; “And you are?”
<p>“Don’t be cute.&nbsp; Where’s Sandi?”&nbsp; She stepped into the house.&nbsp;
“You <i>live</i> here?”
<p>“Mother!”&nbsp; Sandi came running down the stairs.&nbsp; “What do you
think you’re <i>doing</i>?”
<p>“No.&nbsp; What the hell do you think <i>you’re</i> doing?&nbsp; ‘Why
don’t you trust me?’&nbsp; Because I knew what you were up to!&nbsp; God,
Sandi, how stupid do you think I am?”
<p>“You’re wrong.&nbsp; Jane’s my friend.&nbsp; That’s all.”
<p>“There’s no point in continuing to lie about it.”
<p>“Um, Mrs. Griffin, she’s not lying.”
<p>Linda ignored Jane.&nbsp; “And you promised, Sandi.&nbsp; That’s the
part that hurts the most—”
<p>“You’re not listening to me.&nbsp; I kept <i>my</i> promise—”
<p>“Don’t treat me like an idiot.&nbsp; Do you really expect me to believe
that you’re just friends with this—person?&nbsp; For God’s sake! Where
did you find her, anyway?&nbsp; Turning tricks on Dega Street?”
<p>Sandi’s hand hit Linda’s face with a crack like a tree limb snapping.&nbsp;
Linda staggered back and dropped into a chair.
<p>“Listen to me,” Sandi said quietly.&nbsp; “I don’t care what you say
about me, but you never say anything like that about Jane.&nbsp; Is that
understood?”
<p>Linda nodded.
<p>“Good.&nbsp; Now get out.”
<p>Linda got out of the chair, her eyes full of terror, and walked to the
door without taking her eyes off Sandi.&nbsp; She managed to open it and
escape without turning around.&nbsp; Sandi watched the doorway for a few
seconds, went to the couch, sat down, and began to cry.&nbsp; Jane came
over and sat down next to her.
<p>After a minute or so Sandi turned to her and said “I’m sorry.”
<p>“It’s okay,” said Jane.&nbsp; “I understand why you hit her.”
<p>Sandi shook her head.&nbsp; “I’m not sorry about that.”&nbsp; She turned
away.&nbsp; “I’m sorry you had to find out…about me.&nbsp; I didn’t ever
want you to know.”
<p>Jane ran the scene over in her mind.&nbsp; Her eyes widened.&nbsp; “She
thought that you were…and with me?&nbsp; How the hell did she ever get
that idea?”
<p>Sandi turned to her slowly.&nbsp; “I guess I should tell you.”&nbsp;
She took in a deep breath.&nbsp; “It was back when we lived in Glenfield.&nbsp;
There was a girl named Renee…she was like the coolest person I ever met.&nbsp;
She was really beautiful.&nbsp; It turned out she was…and…I guess I…” She
closed her eyes and started crying again.&nbsp; “We didn’t go out on like
dates or anything…but we used to meet a lot.”&nbsp; She stopped for a minute,
trying to calm down.&nbsp; “We never really did anything except kiss.&nbsp;
I guess we’d hold each other.&nbsp; But people found out about it…” She
looked at Jane again.&nbsp; “It was just a horrible scandal.&nbsp; So my
parents decided to move here, you know, where nobody knew who we were or
anything.&nbsp; So I promised Linda that nothing like that would ever happen
again…so I had to go out on dates with boys all the time to prove that
now I was like normal.”&nbsp; She shook her head slowly.&nbsp; “But…I just
don’t care about any of the boys I go out with.&nbsp; But I promised.&nbsp;
I don’t know.&nbsp; I guess you probably want me to leave or something.”
<p>“No!&nbsp; I don’t want you to leave.&nbsp; God, I don’t care if you’re…”
Jane had a horrible thought.&nbsp; “You weren’t…I mean, you and me…?”
<p>Sandi shook her head.&nbsp; “I like you, but, well, not like that.&nbsp;
And, I mean, I know you’re not like that.”
<p>“All right.&nbsp; I mean, I really don’t care if you’re gay, but that
would have been awkward.”
<p>“Mm-hm.”&nbsp; Sandi looked at her curiously.&nbsp; “I thought you’d
like hate me if you found out the truth.”
<p>“Why would you think that?”
<p>“I didn’t think you were like prejudiced or anything, but I lied to
you and stuff.&nbsp; Well, I mean I didn’t actually lie, but I was pretending
that I liked boys and everything.&nbsp; It wasn’t honest.”&nbsp; She stared
at the floor. “I’m like a really bad friend.”
<p>“Come on!&nbsp; Don’t beat yourself up.”&nbsp; Jane took Sandi’s hand.&nbsp;
“I don’t see how you could have been any more honest than you were.&nbsp;
It’s not the kind of thing that you just go around announcing to people.&nbsp;
And you were trying to keep your promise.&nbsp; Jeez!&nbsp; I feel bad
they ever made you make that promise in the first place.”
<p>“It was mostly Linda’s idea.&nbsp; I don’t think I can really hold my
father responsible.”
<p>“Well, unless he tried to stop her, I don’t think you can let him completely
off the hook.”
<p>“I guess not.&nbsp; But she’s really not an easy person to deal with.”&nbsp;
Sandi glanced down at her hands.&nbsp; “Maybe I shouldn’t have slapped
her.&nbsp; But she should never have said that about you.”
<p>“Like I said, I understand why you did it.&nbsp; And I have to admit
that I was at least a little bit glad that you did.”
<p>“So was I.&nbsp; That’s really terrible, isn’t it?”
<p>“I’d say it’s more like really human.”
<p>Sandi managed a half-smile.&nbsp; “I’m glad you’re my friend.”&nbsp;
She sighed.&nbsp; “I guess I should probably go back to my house.&nbsp;
I mean, I’m going to have to do it sooner or later.&nbsp; Could you just
like walk with me?&nbsp; You don’t have to come in or anything, but…I really
don’t want to walk all the way over there by myself.”
<p>“Of course.”
<p>Sandi said very little as they walked, but she held Jane’s hand tightly.&nbsp;
At last they arrived at the Griffin house.&nbsp; Sandi stopped on the doorstep.&nbsp;
“I’m really not sure I can do this.”
<p>Jane nodded. “I’ll come in with you if you think it’ll help.”
<p>“You don’t have to.&nbsp; I’d never forgive myself if anything happened.”
<p>“Hey.&nbsp; I think I can take care of myself.”&nbsp; Jane paused for
a moment.&nbsp; “She doesn’t own a gun, does she?”
<p>“I don’t think so.&nbsp; Um…was that a joke?”
<p>“I’m not sure.”
<p>Sandi closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and opened the door.&nbsp;
To her surprise, her father came running up.&nbsp; “Sandi, have you seen
your mother?”
<p>“Isn’t she here?”
<p>He shook his head.&nbsp; “Sam and Chris said she’d gone over to your
friend’s house…I take it this is your friend?”&nbsp; Jane raised her hand
tentatively.
<p>Sandi blinked and tried to regain her bearings.&nbsp; “This is Jane…um…yes,
she’s my friend.&nbsp; Jane, this is my father, Tom Griffin.”&nbsp; She
turned back to him.&nbsp; “She hasn’t been back here since then?”
<p>“Not as far as I can tell.&nbsp; Did you see her?”
<p>Sandi nodded slowly.&nbsp; “I guess I’d better tell you the whole story.&nbsp;
Um…perhaps we’d better go and sit down first.”&nbsp; They went into the
living room.&nbsp; With help from Jane, Sandi haltingly described her last
encounter with Linda.&nbsp; As she got to the end, she started crying again.&nbsp;
“I’m really sorry.”
<p>After a moment Tom got up, came over to her, and took her in his arms.&nbsp;
She started sobbing.
<p>“God,” he said quietly, “what did we do to you.”
<center>
<p>9.</center>

<p>Jane frowned slightly.&nbsp; “So you’re seeing a counselor?”
<p>Sandi nodded.&nbsp; “It’s just for the whole anger thing.&nbsp; I mean,
I guess I need it.&nbsp; But you know, about the other thing, my dad says
I need to be who I am.”&nbsp; She shook her head.&nbsp; “I wish he didn’t
sound so much like Mr. O’Neill.”
<p>“I can understand that.&nbsp; How’s the counseling going?”
<p>“Well, it’s kind of too early to say, but so far I guess it’s going
all right.&nbsp; If it works I’m going to see if they can help my brothers.”
<p>“You think they need anger management?”
<p>“<i>Brat</i> management.”
<p>Jane took another slice of pizza off the tray.&nbsp; “So is Linda speaking
to you yet?”
<p>“More or less.” Sandi smiled thinly.&nbsp; “I think she’s kind of like
afraid of me now.&nbsp; I suppose I should feel bad about that.”
<p>“I wouldn’t.”
<p>“Thanks.”&nbsp; Sandi sighed.&nbsp; “I feel really weird now that I
don’t have to pretend I like boys any more.&nbsp; I just don’t know how
other people are going to take it.”
<p>“Like Quinn?”
<p>“Exactly.&nbsp; But I have to tell her and stuff.&nbsp; I don’t want
her to find out from some other person.”
<p>Jane shook her head.&nbsp; “I can see where you wouldn’t be looking
forward to that.”
<p>“No.”&nbsp; Sandi sipped from her drink.&nbsp; “Anyway, I decided to
tell Heidi first.&nbsp; Seeing as how she’s foreign and everything, I’m
hoping she’ll have an enlightened attitude.”&nbsp; She frowned and looked
at her watch.&nbsp; “Actually, she was supposed to be here by now.”
<p>“You’re planning to tell her here?&nbsp; Tonight?&nbsp; In public?”
<p>“Well, it would be kind of weird if I took her off in private to do
it.&nbsp; She might think…I don’t know.”&nbsp; Sandi blushed brightly.
<p>“I get the picture.&nbsp; Anyway, here she comes.”
<p>Heidi came up to the table, smiling brightly.&nbsp; As she sat down
Jane thought she caught a whiff of perfume.
<p>“I’m sorry to be so late!&nbsp; You know, sometimes it takes a long
time to get ready.&nbsp; So, what is it that’s the big important thing
you have to tell me?”
<p>Sandi steeled herself.&nbsp; “I’m afraid I’ve kind of been lying to
you, Heidi.”&nbsp; She could hardly look into Heidi’s innocent blue eyes.&nbsp;
“I hope what I have to say won’t like completely freak you out or anything.&nbsp;
Um…I know you thought that I was like normal and stuff, but I’m not really.&nbsp;
I’m…um…well…I like…girls.&nbsp; Instead of boys.”
<p>Heidi stared at her.&nbsp; “This is it?”
<p>“Mm-hm.”
<p>“But I already know this.”
<p>Sandi’s mouth dropped open.
<p>Jane turned to Heidi.&nbsp; “How’d you figure it out?”
<p>“I’m thinking that’s why she chased me around in the first place.”&nbsp;
She turned back to Sandi.&nbsp; “I thought when you said you had a big
thing to say, you finally would ask me to be your girlfriend.”
<p>Sandi stared at Heidi in shock, registering for the first time that
she was wearing an obviously-new dress, a dress in Sandi’s favorite color,
aubergine; that she was wearing pearl earrings and a silver necklace, and
she’d put on perfume and had her nails done—all for someone whose girlfriend
she obviously wanted to be.
<p>Sandi reached across the table and took her hand.
