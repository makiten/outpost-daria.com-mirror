<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>
sped through the stop sign without even seeing it. He glanced backwards, not to
see if there was a cop watching, but to see how his sister was doing in the
back seat. Focusing back on the road, he tried to stay calm. He never would
have guessed his first drive as a <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>legally</span>
licensed driver would be to the emergency room. The fact that she’d stopped
crying scared him more than her howls of pain.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>“How you doing, Janey?” He tried to sound calm
and in control.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>There were a few sniffles. “It’s going all
numb.” Her voice was thick from crying.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>
pressed the pedal down further, tearing through an intersection a second after
his light had turned red. He didn’t hear the angry honks behind him. Numb? He
wasn’t sure, but that didn’t sound good. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Pulling into the emergency room entrance he
drove straight up to the doors. He jumped out and tore open the backseat door.
Trying to be as gentle as possible while hurrying, he maneuvered Jane out of
the back seat and ran inside carrying her. He left the car there with the door
hanging open.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Jane started howling again, and he flinched
since she was now only inches from his ears. “I’m sorry it hurts, Janey. We’re
here.”&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>The triage nurse looked up towards the source
of the noise. Spotting a young man carrying an obviously injured girl she stood
and caught the eye of a passing orderly. He hurried down the hall and grabbed a
gurney.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>
almost collapsed with relief when he saw the nurse stand up. “My sister…she’s
hurt.”&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>The orderly came up with the gurney. “Put her
here.”&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>
tried to put her down but she wouldn’t let go of his neck. He managed to pry
her loose but her howls of pain and fear intensified. “It’ll be okay Janey,
they’ll help you.”&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>As the orderly wheeled her quickly away, she
tried to turn. “Don’t leave <span class=SpellE>meeeee</span>!!”&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>“I’ll see you as soon as I can.” He called as
they passed through a set of double doors. He walked to the triage desk, not
noticing the envious stares of the people who’d been sitting in the waiting
room, waiting for who knows how long. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>The nurse handed him a clipboard. “Fill these
out.”&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>He took it and stared at it blankly. “I don’t
know…”&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>“Fill out what you know. We’ll get to the rest
in a minute.” A short blonde nurse walked in and handed her a file. She looked
up and signaled to a middle-aged woman and her teenage son uncomfortably
hunched in the aqua and pink waiting room chairs. They followed the nurse out
and down the hallway. The phone rang.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Seeing the nurse wasn’t going to be any more
helpful at the moment, <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City> walked
slowly to the nearest chair. He filled out the name and address and did his
best on the medical history and current conditions sections but had no idea
what to do for insurance. He glanced down the hall they had taken Jane hoping
they were doing whatever it was that needed to be done and that Jane would be
all right.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>He looked through the forms again, trying not
to see the accident again in his mind. He had been outside strumming on his
acoustic guitar while Jane climbed all over the gazebo like a monkey. He was
annoyed because she was chattering away, describing the yard to herself in an
attempt to jump-start her muse, which, according to her, had been flagging
lately. He was trying to work out some chords for the band he’d just joined and
couldn’t concentrate with her yammering. He had just decided to go back to the
basement when he heard a surprised yelp followed by a sickening crunch and then
the most god-awful screaming he’d ever heard in his life. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>She’d slipped off the railing and fallen
crookedly on the stairs. He fought a wave of nausea at the sight of her left
leg bending at a sharp angle in a place that should never bend. He’d grabbed
her and sped to the hospital.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Now, sitting in the waiting area among
ill-looking children, worried mothers and various anxious people, he realized
he had no idea if they even had insurance or how to pay for any of this. His
mother and father were off again, somewhere in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Belize</st1:place></st1:country-region>?
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Brazil</st1:place></st1:country-region>? He
couldn’t remember. Why weren’t they ever there when they needed them?&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>He headed back to the triage desk and the nurse
waved him to another station. He sat across from a stout woman with a terrible
haircut and a no-nonsense expression. He handed her the clipboard uncertainly.
&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>She picked a pair of reading glasses off her
ample bosom and scanned the forms. Looking up at him she frowned. “No
insurance?”&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>
swallowed. “I don’t…I don’t know. My parents probably have some, but they
weren’t home…I just brought her here as fast as I could.”&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>“All right. Can you call them? When will they
be home?”&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>He shrugged. “Next week sometime? They didn’t
really say.”&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>The nurse’s expression shifted. “They left you
alone? You are under eighteen, correct?”&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>
didn’t like where this was going. “My older brother is around, and my sister,
Penny. I guess they’re in charge while mom and dad are gone.”&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>“Where are they?” She sounded suspicious.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>“Um…Penny’s working at a diner on <st1:place>Main</st1:place>
until eight. I don’t know where Wind is.” He said. Wind might have been home.
It was his car <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City> had taken.
Then again Wind had started seeing that woman…Clarissa? Claudia? She had a nice
car, Mustang, cherry red. The nurse halted his wandering thoughts.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>“You’ll have to get them to come in and sign
some things in place of your parents, then. They are over eighteen, correct?”
Her voice was stern.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>“Um…yeah. Penny’ll come I guess. I have to call
her…” <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City> just wanted to get away
from the nurse. He hadn’t thought beyond getting his sister help.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>The nurse pointed behind him. “There’s a pay
phone over there.”&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Grateful he had change in his pocket, <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>
went to call the diner. After explaining what had happened and hearing a long
string of expletives from Penny, he felt a bit better knowing she was on her
way. He went to tell the nurse at the desk and then wait.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>A few hours, an angry exchange with the nurse,
and an insurance arrangement later, he and Penny stood when a nurse came to
take them to Jane. The doctor explained the compound fracture and how lucky
Jane had been to get in so quickly. He handed Penny a prescription for
painkillers and a sheet explaining what to expect in the next few weeks.
Agreeing to make a follow-up appointment before they left the hospital, they
turned to Jane as the doctor left.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>
looked at how small and fragile she looked in the bed. She blinked blearily up
at them, still woozy from anesthetic and painkillers. “Wanna go home
now.”&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>“Tomorrow, Jane.” Penny said. “Just think how
nice and quiet it’ll be here.” <i>Not like at the house. I swear, as soon as I
have enough money I am so out of here. I’m so sick of being the mom.</i>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>“You’ll be okay Janey, I’ll come get you first
thing.” <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City> assured her. Penny
looked at him in surprise, wondering if he knew pick-up was at <st1:time
Minute="0" Hour="8">8 am</st1:time>. Somehow, she knew he’d manage it for
Jane.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>And he did. He was even there early. They
wheeled Jane out the front doors and she awkwardly hobbled to the car trying
out her new crutches. Seeing she was in pretty good spirits <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>
handed her a small package.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>“What’s this?” She asked, settling in the
backseat. “Oooo! New markers! Thanks <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>!
This cast is so….white.”&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>
smiled as she immediately began doodling.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>He drove her to her follow-up appointments and
made sure she followed the doctor’s instructions. He helped her figure out how
to wrap plastic bags around the cast and run the shower so she didn’t get it
wet. He wrote her songs when she was unhappy because she couldn’t play
outside.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Eight weeks later he took her to her first
physical therapy appointment. She’d been so excited the day she’d gotten the
cast off, <span class=GramE>then</span> absolutely crushed because she’d fully
expected to be able to just hop off the table and run home. He’d taken her out
for pizza to cheer her up. Now they were at the rehab office and Jane sullenly
hobbled to the door.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>
waited in the front room while Jane was in the back re-learning how to walk.
When they were done, he took the sheets the therapist handed him and assured
her he would make sure Jane did her exercises at home.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>He thought she was awfully quiet on the ride
home. “You want to stop for ice cream?”&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>“She said it might take two or three months!
The whole summer will be gone by then!” Jane exclaimed. <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>
didn’t know what to say.&nbsp;Jane looked out the window with a determined pout.
“Well, I’ll show her.”&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>
smiled as he pulled into the ice cream place.&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Six weeks later, they left her final
appointment, Jane grinning like mad. <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>
had used some of the money he’d scrounged up to buy her a new pair of running
shoes as a congratulations. She pulled the double knot on her right shoe
tighter.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>“You’re sure she said it was okay?” <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>
asked as they pulled in the driveway.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>“Yes!” Jane said exasperatedly. “You talked to
her.”&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>“Just be careful, Janey.” He said as she shot
out the door.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>He watched as she took off down the street at a
full run and could see the joy in every step.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Daria sat at the lane’s kitchen table,
entranced by <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>’s story. She’d
made a snippy comment when she’d arrived and found Jane still off on a run,
instead of ready for bad movie night. “So that’s why she loves running so
much.”&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>
nodded. “I think that day, if she could have, she would have just kept running
forever.” He shrugged. “Guess she got tired.”&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Daria smiled a little at him. She wouldn’t gripe about Jane’s running again.
After all, she did it for the best reason there was: Because she could.<o:p></o:p></p>
