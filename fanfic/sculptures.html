<p><font size="-1">Yes, this is a crossover. Buffy the Vampire Slayer 
and Daria. I've explained each series' characters in terms of the 
other, so don't worry if you're not familiar
with one. If you don't know either, what are you doing here?</font>
<p><font size="-1">Occurs after Restless in Buffy, and between Dye! Dye!
My Darling and the movie in Daria. Spoilers for both eps. Buffy vs 
Dracula (great ep) and Is It Fall Yet? (I'll assume it lost something 
in the transcription) have <b>not</b> happened, mainly because they 
hadn't aired when I started writing this.</font>

<p><font size="-1">Footnotes are at the end of each part. Well, 
they're marginally more interesting than commercial breaks...</font>
<p><font size="-1">And now, a brief guide to Buffy mythology, so 
no-one can plead ignorance in feedback... :o) just to clear up any 
confusion: The Slayer is a teenage girl (always female, and this 
being network TV, always attractive) with superhuman strength, speed, 
agility, sight and hearing, skill with weaponry and so forth, for 
hunting and killing vampires and other creatures of the night. When 
one dies, another is "called" (suddenly gains the powers).<br>
Vampires on Buffy have strength and whatnot increased to varying 
degrees, depending on the vampire. Most of the time, they look like 
the humans they were, except when they're first rising from the dead 
or are angry or about to feed, when they grow fangs, short sharp 
claws in place of fingernails, and facial ridges described by Lew 
Richardson as looking like a cross between Hulk Hogan and a trilobite 
("game face", "demon face", "vampire face"). Notable loophole: They 
can survive in <b>in</b>direct sunlight (through windows not facing 
the sun, heavily overcast days, etc) but direct sunlight causes them 
to burn to ashes. The same applies with fire from other sources. A 
wooden object (stakes are traditional and efficient) to the heart 
will achieve the same ashes without all the annoying flames, as will 
good old-fashioned decapitation. Holy water burns like strong acid. 
Garlic will apparently harm them, though it's never been used on the 
show. They commonly use sewers for moving around, so running water's 
a non-issue. They will cower away from crosses, and if forced to 
touch them will get burnt nastily (this doesn't stop the quicker ones 
from lightly batting them out of people's hands). Same with holy 
books. They suck blood from living humans to feed, but someone who 
gets completely drained just dies without fuss. For a new vampire to 
be created ("turned", "vamped"), first the vampire has to suck some 
of the victim's blood, then the victim has to suck the vampire's 
blood (normally the vampire will take most of the blood from his 
prospective childe to make sure they're too out of it to resist the 
exchange). Once turned, it is said that a demon takes over the 
human's body. This is on par with the Easter Bunny for truth; what 
actually happens is that the "negative" portions of the human's 
personality get brought to the fore and little things like the 
conscience get driven back... but don't tell Willow that. Now, enough 
fine print, on with the show:</font>

<p><b>EXT.: OUTSIDE THE BRONZE, LATE NIGHT</b>
<p><i>(Music: "Shake Me", Mint Royale. Imagine a cross between Fatboy Slim
and the Care Bears. Only even more mindlessly, sickeningly cheerful.)</i>
<p><i>(Buffy, Riley, Xander, Anya, Tara and Willow (relax, Daria fans,
all will be explained) are leaving the Bronze... a rather dodgy 
converted-warehouse
nightclub, but the only one in town. They are accompanied rather a lot
of other people -- in fact, the entire clubful is leaving at the same time.
Obviously, someone's decided to close the joint early. A sufficiently bored
viewer might take a peek through the door of the converted warehouse and
realize that someone's been taking the whole "steamy nightclub" thing way
too seriously.)</i>
<p>XANDER: I think we can safely say this sucks.
<p><i>(A brief description of Xander, for the uninitiated: Tall, black
hair, optimistic, self-deprecating sense of humour and general personality
to befit your standard zit-faced beanpole, but since ugly, thin-looking
males don't generally get on TV, he has a kind of boyish, reasonably 
good-looking
face and a relatively muscular body. Is standing next to his girlfriend
in Anya. I should point out that everyone here is neatly paired off.)</i>
<p>BUFFY: The last day before we all have to go away for summer and the
air conditioning at the one good club in town goes boom.
<p><i>(Buffy: cheerleader-beautiful, bottled blonde, athletic, short, dressed
reasonably fashionably, standing next to Riley (the tall, strong, 
soldier-next-door
type)... but she has a really nasty job nights. She's the Vampire Slayer,
the one girl in all the world with the superhuman strength, reflexes, skill
and aim required to take it to the assorted creatures of the night one-on-one,
or, as the case may be, one-on-a-dozen-or-so. Despite the considerable
B.S. she's gone through as a result, her personality and general perkiness
is so close to that of Quinn or even a more intelligent Brittany it's 
unsettling,
though not so unsettling as the fact she can and does get reasonably good
grades and has a wonderfully sarcastic wit that she doesn't use nearly
as often as she could. No need to worry about the waste, though -- she'll
be dead by the end of the chapter.)</i>
<p>TARA: Well, it could be worse... There must be somewhere else we can
go...
<p><i>(Tara: Blonde hair, average height, has what a TV exec would consider
"nice-girl charm". In other words, any more shy and she'd be some inoffensive
species of rodent. Practising Wiccan in the Hollywood-movie good-witch
sense. Set up fairly tastefully by commercial TV standards with Willow.
General purpose in the scheme of things unclear as of the end of the fourth
season.)</i>
<p>WILLOW: Nuh-uh. Not at this time of night.
<p><i>(Willow: Red hair, also short, clothing bears a slight New Age influence.
Jewish by birth, now a witch (see above). Originally she embodied the phrase
"shrinking violet", now fairly self-confident, due in no small part to
the help she gives Buffy in researching and defeating the neverending 
diabolical
menaces that hit Sunnydale every Tuesday night at prime time. Had the intellect
to go to "any college in the country, four or five in Europe if I want",
but instead opted for her local so she could keep fighting the baddies
that tend to congregate around the town, what with the Mouth of Hell and
everything.)</i>
<p>ANYA: Well, Xander, <b>we</b> can always...
<p><i>(Anya: Brown-red hair, standard TV-teenage-female looks and dress.
Unlike most TV teens, however, her character is actually <b>older</b> than
the actress. By about eleven hundred years. She's a former vengeance demon,
who whiled away the millennia playing genie to pissed-off women looking
for revenge on their former (or soon-to-be-former) significant male others.
As you can imagine, some of the wishes she granted were... graphic. Someone
Ms Barch would wish she'd known. Lost her powers when she came to Sunnydale
(surprised?), as seen in "The Wish". Now stuck as a mortal teenager, albeit
an eccentric one. This being the WB, "eccentric" can more or less be covered
by the phrase "sex-obsessed", with the occasional conversational faux pas
on that topic thrown in. Normally with Xander, with whom she shares a certain
"townies-in-arms" camaraderie, as well as a pretty-damn-serious-thanks
boyfriend-girlfriend relationship. In small doses, however, one of the
single funniest characters on TV today.)</i>
<p>RILEY: Anya?
<p><i>(Riley: Male character who in the fourth season is introduced as
a potential love interest for the female lead(s). In short, the Buffy 
equivalent
of Tom, with similar levels of love, hatred and indifference found among
factions of the fans. I wasn't kidding when I said soldier-next-door earlier.
Tall, broad-shouldered, black-haired, midwestern upbringing, with training
and experience in a cheap X-Files rip-off government/military conspiracy
called the Initiative, the chief villains in Buffy S4. Also has experience
in helping bring it down, following some really pathetic "I've always followed
orders" angst. Still, like his Daria equivalent, I find him annoyingly
hard to dislike.)</i>
<p>ANYA: <i>(sharp)</i> Yes?
<p>XANDER: Anya, we discussed this. The... whole thing's not something
we talk about, except with each other.
<p>ANYA: Actually, Xander, I was going to suggest we... oh, screw it.
<p><i>(turns around, trudges off in another direction)</i>
<p>XANDER: Anya, wait! <i>(starts to run after her, out of shot) (O/S)</i>
We can talk about sex if you want...
<p><i>(A nervous pause. They've walked a fair way, and the crowd has more
or less dispersed.)</i>
<p>RILEY: So, Willow, you didn't say what you were doing over summer break...
<p>WILLOW: <i>(resigned, with that wonderful good-girl pseudo-sarcasm of
hers)</i> Going home for the first six weeks. My parents weren't around
much when I was in high school, and suddenly decided we should all get
to know each other over summer. Then we're going, as a family, to nowhere,
New England. <i>(Riley looks confused)</i> My mother's a 
great-great-something-or-other
of some Satzman guy who took a boat over here earlier last century, and
they've organized some big week-long family reunion in a tiny little town
called Lawndale because some distant cousin's opening a new hotel there
and wanted some big... convention there to drum up business.
<p>RILEY: Oh. You already know I'm going back to Idaho wi-- agh!
<p><i>(Riley grabs his arm in pain, lifts his elbow and sees... a bullet
wound.)</i>
<p>RILEY: GET DOWN!
<p><i>(Buffy doesn't need to be told twice, and spins around to face the
threat while throwing herself to the ground with all the speed her Slayer
abilities afford. Unfortunately, she stays there. Turns out all dropping
down achieved was to have the second bullet hit her in the forehead, killing
her instantly, rather than the spine, where it merely would have caused
paralysis.)</i>
<p><i>(Yes, folks. She's dead. And she's not coming back.)</i>
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>INT.: A DARK, FORMALLY-FURNISHED OFFICE.</b>
<p><i>(A tweed-suited man is sitting behind a mahogany desk -- long time
"Buffy" fans recognise him as Quentin Travers, the uber-Watcher from "Helpless"
(Watcher, noun: personal coach and researcher for the Slayer in theory,
normally a cluelessly stodgy bureaucrat in practice. British almost without
exception owing to Joss Whedon's public-school education -- but if he had
been there, you'd think he could write them a little less two-dimensionally).
Just think stereotypical-old-English-guy. A knock on the door is heard.)</i>
<p>TRAVERS: Come in.
<p><i>(A similarly suited man enters. His subservience to Travers is obvious
immediately from his stance, apparent age and behaviour.)</i>
<p>MAN: Terribly sorry for interrupting you, Mr Travers, but I thought
you'd--
<p>TRAVERS: <i>(tired, curt)</i> What is it, Anderson?
<p>ANDERSON: Buffy Summers... the mutinous Slayer... she's dead.
<p>TRAVERS: <i>(slight shock)</i> Dead?
<p>ANDERSON: Yes.
<p>TRAVERS: You're quite sure?
<p>ANDERSON: Yes. Less than twenty-four hours ago. She was shot in the--
<p>TRAVERS: No need to go into detail. A pity. Her wilfulness was easily
outweighed by her talents -- I don't think we'll have one as good as her
for some time. <i>(pause)</i> Her replacement's abilities should manifest
within the day. I take it all of the potential candidates are available
and under our education? We don't need another debacle such as Faith's...
<p>ANDERSON: No, sir. But after Faith's calling, and the tracking down
of that unfortunate Tibetan girl, there is only one candidate with even
a remote possibility of being chosen that we have been unable to maintain
contact with.
<p>TRAVERS: <i>(amused)</i> Where is she? Kazakhstan? The Sahara? Australia?
<p>ANDERSON: The United States.
<p>TRAVERS: I'm sorry?
<p>ANDERSON: <i>(nervous)</i> We've been tracking her since her childhood,
but her parents, especially her mother, have been extremely hostile to
our overtures, as has the child. Legal action has been threatened on more
than one occasion. In the end we had no choice but to tactically withdraw,
if we wanted to protect our organization's good name in the area. Thankfully,
the odds of her being the one are reasonably remote, especially considering
her ineptitude in the athletic and strength-related areas Slayers normally...
<i>(trails
off)</i>
<p><i>(a pause)</i>
<p>TRAVERS: How long have you been a Watcher, Anderson?
<p>ANDERSON: Thirteen years, sir. Entered the Academy immediately upon
leaving secondary school.
<p>TRAVERS: In time, you will come to realize that should you make assumptions
such as that one, the opposite invariably occurs. Be sure to keep an eye
on her.

physics and apply it to this fic, you'll quickly figure out that the events

<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>EXT.: NIGHT, A PARK, SOMEWHERE IN LAWNDALE.</b>
<p><i>(Music: "Love Torn Us Under", Manic Street Preachers)</i>
<p><i>(Daria is sitting on a bench, fiddling absently with a twig, looking
so depressed even the untrained eye can spot it. For the Buffy fans, this
is saying a <b>lot</b> -- normally, if hope is the thing with feathers
that perches in the soul, she's a scarecrow. Her facial expressions are
generally restricted to either a rigid deadpan frown or a rigid deadpan
smirk (aka the Mona Lisa smile). Brown, shoulder-length hair. Green zip-up
jacket covers a burnt-orange shirt -- think of the worst possible clash
of colours. Knee-length pleated black skirt, and shit-kicker  boots
generally agreed to be steel-capped Docs among fans, although there's no
evidence to support it. Oh, and big, thick, black-rim glasses. Set the
scene a night or two after her... discussion with best friend Jane in "Dye!
Dye! My Darling". To summarise, she's gotten into a fight with her over
a mutual boyfriend in that most tired of soap-opera clich&eacute;s. Anyone
else remember when Daria didn't need that to be a good show? End rant.
In her usual form, the best deadpan sarcasm on TV today, no contest. Right
now, well... normally it takes a bulldozer to get her out of bed before
the alarm (and after it, for that matter). Out of bed, bedroom and window
at night... you get the idea. She isn't sleeping, and is generally feeling
like emotional landfill. Which is a problem, because a year ago she didn't
<b>have</b>
any emotions she'd outwardly acknowledge.)</i>
<p>DARIA: <i>(sighs, to herself)</i> I don't believe this is happening.
This isn't happening. <i>(lets her head settle into her hands, and briefly
looks like she's about to sob. She doesn't, but looks up suddenly, and
over her right shoulder. A tall, dark figure with overstyled hair comes
out of the shadows in that general direction.)</i> Go ahead, kill me. I
don't really care right now.
<p><i>(The tall, dark figure steps forward, into the limited light. His
face looks like something out of some trashy vampire TV show. Three guesses
which.)</i>
<p>VAMPIRE: <i>(suitably inhuman growl)</i> My pleasure.
<p><i>(He leaps. All sound fades out. Daria rolls out of the way, base
fear and instinct saving her life. He crashes, sprawling over the bench,
and she starts to back away, slowly, terrified. Any concept of rational
thought on her part right now has gone out the window, replaced with sheer
primal terror and that instinct thing. Not completely beneficial instinct
as it turns out, since she's backing towards a tree and the vampire, now
on his feet, has every other means of escape covered. She turns to the
tree and starts scrabbling for a grip, her hand grabbing a long, narrow,
low, stripped-bare branch and ripping off a good length without apparent
effort. The vampire stomps in closer, taking a sizable chunk out of the
distance between them in one step. Daria takes a flimsy, desperate, telegraphed
swing at him with the branch, which he effortlessly sidesteps, still going
towards her, but opening up an escape route around from the bench. She
steps back towards it, not thinking to run. The vampire comes forward,
moves onto one foot for another leap, and she brings in the branch again,
at the same angle with a bit more velocity. It slams into the vampire's
ear, and carries along with him for about half a metre, and he slams into
the tree -- with his heart conveniently where the broken-off stump of the
branch is. Said vampire quickly goes grey (literally) and dissolves into
a cloud of dust. Daria just looks at the branch, not fully comprehending,
and hears a faint rustle in the bushes, an owl hooting, sees a suspicious
black van parked across the road, two more dark figures approaching in
the distance, and now she breaks into a run...)</i>

<p><i>(Music: "Slowdance", Something for Kate)</i>
<p><i>(We're in the room of Daria's aforementioned best friend Jane Lane,
an overhead shot of her giving a good look at her in bed in the half-light,
asleep. An aspiring artist with that wonderful bed hair any Daria fan who's
seen it knows and loves. She's still in a state of warm war with the title
character after her boyfriend Tom first kissed Daria, who quickly told
her, leading to a breakup with the guy and a crying-out-loud argument with
Daria for the big pre-movie cliffhanger. A loud thump-and-rattle comes
from off screen, and Jane stirs, getting up reluctantly and staggering
out of the room. Cut to the house's front door from her POV. She opens
it, and there's Daria, looking pathetic and terrified -- but not exhausted
-- worlds away from her usual stoic stiff upper lip. Cut to and fade on
Jane's face.)</i>

<p><i>(Music: "When I Grow Up", Garbage)</i>
<p><i>(On the whole, a pleasant, clean, rather dull place, like most new
office buildings, with the walls painted white and a soft corporate-blue
carpet. Slowly pan across to a tall, blonde, sturdy (is that the euphemism
these days?) woman who looks to be about forty-five, wearing a dark blue
power suit, and holding a coffee mug. She walks over to a window and gently
touches the thick, opaque white board covering it with some tenderness,
as if it were a small child. The ringing of a mobile phone interrupts the
scene. She pulls it out of her pocket and thumbs it on.)</i>
<p>WOMAN: Yes? Aleph. About time I got through. I just got a call from
California. Apparently, Buffy Summers is definitely dead...
<p>"ALEPH": <i>(phone V/O, female voice we've heard somewhere before, 
interrupting)</i>
Where every trick in the occult books fail, a plain old vanilla hitman
with a sniper rifle succeeds. I won't say I told you so. <i>(pause)</i>
Wait, I just did.
<p>WOMAN: I wouldn't mind talking to the guy about his accuracy. We just
wanted her paralysed, not dead. As it is...
<p>"ALEPH": <i>(interrupting again)</i> We've got at <b>least</b> two weeks
to raise hell in any sense we want while the Watchers' Council gets the
replacement out and fighting. If they even have the replacement.
<p>WOMAN: Well <b>yes</b>, if that's the way you want to put it. Of course,
it'd help if you actually had some idea of <b>how</b> you wanted to do
the raising. And...
<p>"ALEPH": Nah, destruction and torture's only fun when it's spontaneous.
Don't tell me <b>you</b> didn't enjoy that week in San Francisco. When
you weren't getting so goddamn worried about being in the same <b>state</b>
as Buffy Summers, "Super Slayer". Who was obviously <b>just</b> as vulnerable
to the rest to the common high-velocity lump of lead.
<p>WOMAN: You did see the Council reports, right? Three dozen potential
Slayers under guard and education? They don't even really <b>need</b>...
<p>"ALEPH": I'm thinking "gift horse", "look", "mouth", Tav. The Sunnydale
hunters' only real weapon is <b>dead</b> thanks to us, the never-coming-back
kind of dead, and getting cremated within the week. Going by those reports
you make such a big thing out of, the Council of Wankers don't know we
exist. Ignorance is bliss. Only not for the ignorant. C'mon, steal a Learjet,
get over here and <b>kill</b> somebody! Don't tell me you're still living
on bottled blood...
<p>"TAV": <i>(looks down at the red "coffee" in the mug she's holding)</i>

hard. To the beat of the music, if possible. Jane is at her front door,
looking daggers at Daria standing outside. Whatever twisted idea of a moment
there was is broken when Daria shoulders her way in from fear, knocking
Jane roughly out of the way, and slams the door behind her.)</i>

<p>TRAVERS: So it has to be her. No-one else is showing any aptitude 
whatsoever?
<i>(pause)</i>
Just our luck. Can the Hellmouth be left... oh, you already have someone
there? Excellent... <i>(pause)</i> I think I'll handle this personally.
I'll be taking an assistant -- I assume you can arrange the necessary bookings
on the next... <i>(pause)</i> Not for a day or two?
<i>(sighs)</i> Very
well then. <i>(pause)</i> And to you.

<p><i>(Music: "Blisterment", The Superjesus)</i>
<p><i>(Overhead shot of Daria lying down on Jane's couch, sleeping fitfully.
She's having "the nightmares"... we see very quick cuts through some dark
and dirty sewer, a small, dark and not so dirty underground lair, one or
two different cemeteries, the power-suited vampire from earlier, a set
of claws at Trent's neck, Tom and Daria duking it out, and the family 
assortment
of evil demons and artefacts. She awakes with a start.)</i>
<p>JANE: <i>(O/S)</i> Daria?
<p>DARIA: <i>(bleary)</i> I'm up, Jane!
<p>JANE: <i>(O/S, sardonic)</i> Don't wanna be late!
<p>DARIA: <i>(quiet, to herself)</i> No... wouldn't want that...
<i>(she
hauls herself off of the couch and half-staggers out of shot)</i>
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>INT.: LANE KITCHEN.</b>
<p><i>(Music continues. Daria half-staggers in, and Jane is standing near
the fridge.)</i>
<p>JANE: I really don't know why I bother looking, with Trent in the house.
There's nothing in here except Mom's leftover mushroom surprise. <i>(shudders
briefly)</i>
<p>DARIA: Do <b>not</b> talk to me about that. Ever again. Do you understand
me?
<p>JANE: Whoa, OK, OK... If I'd known you were still bitter about it...
<p>DARIA: <i>(getting angry)</i> Me? Bitter? What the hell--
<p><i>(Interrupt this pleasant scene with a nearby phone ringing. Jane
trades looks with Daria and picks it up.)</i>
<p>JANE: <i>(cautious)</i> Yo.
<p><i>(Standard</i> Daria <i>diagonal phone split-screen. Jane on the left,
Daria's mother in her kitchen on the right. Buffy fans, meet Helen 
Morgendorffer,
brown round-cut hair, magenta power suit (this is a cartoon, 'kay?), and
an aggressive demeanour, unless she's having a nice heart-to-heart with
Daria  or trying to suck up to, well... anyone. Since she works as
your classic ambulance-chasing lawyer, these two personality traits suit
her well.)</i>
<p>HELEN: <i>(sickly sweet)</i> Hello, Jane, sorry for calling at this
un<b>god</b>ly hour, but you wouldn't happen to have seen Daria, would
you? I <b>know</b> you two have had your disagreements lately but--
<p>JAKE: <i>(O/S, Daria's father, think Homer Simpson in a shirt, tie and
(possibly) toupee. Usual pathetically funny Jake-going-postal 
anger.)</i>Dammit,
Helen, quit beating around the bush! My kiddo could be <b>anywhere</b>
out there and--
<p>JANE: <i>(hears him rant, slightly amused)</i> Tell Jake to relax, Mrs
Morgendorffer, she's right here.
<p>HELEN: Really. May I ask why?
<p><i>(Jane covers the mouthpiece, whispers to Daria)</i>
<p>JANE: <i>(sharp)</i> What do I say? It's your mom. On the warpath.
<p>DARIA: Oh, <b>hell</b>... <i>(sighs)</i> I'll handle it. <i>(Jane gives
her the phone)</i>Hey, Mom.
<p>HELEN: Hello, Daria. You wouldn't care to tell me how I could see you
in bed at eleven o'clock one night and not at eight the next morning?
<p>DARIA: Erm... well... you see, Mom...
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>EXT.: ROSENBERG HOUSE. FRONT DOOR.</b>
<p><i>(We see Willow, laden with bags and suitcases, walk up to the door
and stop, exhausted and looking like her best friend's just died. Unsurprising
since that's exactly what's happened.
Tara follows, similarly burdened and looking almost as miserable. Willow
puts a suitcase down, and tries a key on the door. After much rattling
and frustrated thumping, she shrugs her shoulders and sits down on the
suitcase.)</i>
<p>TARA: She... changed the locks?
<p>WILLOW: <i>(nodding)</i> Looks like it.
<p>TARA: Why?
<p><i>(Willow just shrugs.)</i>
<p><i>(pause)</i>
<p>TARA: Can you get in any other way?
<p>WILLOW: <i>(shakes her head)</i> Not since that whole 
Hansel-and-Gretel-demon,
burning-at-the-stake thing last year I told you about. <i>(sigh)</i> She
said she'd be home (looks at her watch) an hour ago.
<p><i>(a longer pause)</i>
<p>TARA: Do you want to talk about it?
<p><i>(Willow looks down, gathering herself before attempting to answer,
and in the oldest trick in the dodgy-fic-writing book, Willow's mother
Sheila's car is heard rolling loudly up the driveway off-screen, followed
by a door slamming, and her voice:)</i>
<p>SHEILA: <i>(O/S)</i> Sorry I'm so late, Willow...
<p><i>(Sheila enters the shot. Daria fans, this woman is kinda like Daria's
mother pre-WWIH, but without the occasional sessions of guilty "Quality
Parenting". Basically, Kate Cullen (from Canadibrit's Lookalike Series,
ignorant one) could take lessons from her in being a negligent, callous
workaholic.)</i>
<p>SHEILA: ... the flight got delayed an hour, and apparently there's another
conference out near Carter County. So I bought seats on the next flight
for you and Ira, but he had to postpone, I don't know what we'll do about
that, and we'll go there early for the family reunion, it's all been 
arranged...
<i>(actually
looks in her daughter's general direction, and is immediately hostile on
seeing Tara)</i> Oh. Is this Bunny?
<p>WILLOW: No. It's Tara. I told you about her, remember. <i>(A memory
comes back to Sheila with visible effect, and she tries to speak) </i><b>Buffy</b>
is dead. <i>(shorter pause, Willow stifles a sob, her mother tries to open
her mouth again)</i> Two days ago... <i>(starts to openly cry, staggering
a little before Tara catches hold of her)</i>

the most remote idea of what to say.)</i>

<p><i>(Music: "Blood Money", Primal Scream)</i>
<p><i>(It's raining again. Look, I know it's summer over there, but not
from where I'm sitting (Australia in August). Anyway, it's good for the
atmosphere. Two small, charter jets are seen coming in to land, one after
the other, neither heavily laden. A businesswoman gets out of one, two
men in familiar tweed out of the other.)</i>
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>INT.: AIRPORT ARRIVALS LOUNGE.</b>
<p><i>(Music continues. There's an open food and drink counter nearby,
and one or two cleaners standing around. The two gentlemen enter through
an outside gate, looking tired and very wet. From this angle, we can better
recognise them -- it's Travers and Anderson.)</i>
<p>TRAVERS: Someone did have transport arranged?
<p>ANDERSON: We... there was supposed to be a taxi waiting.
<p>TRAVERS: For how long, exactly?
<p><i>(Anderson sighs deeply... we pan across the room to the businesswoman
-- "Tav" from earlier -- standing in the corner nursing a mug of (real)
coffee. Looking up briefly, she sees the tweed, and face-faults. She hurries
out.)</i>
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>INT.: AIRPORT TOILETS.</b>
<p><i>(Music continues. "Tav", standing inside a locked cubicle, pulls
out her mobile and dials a number.)</i>
<p>"TAV": Aleph. It's me. We have a problem.
<p>"ALEPH": <i>(sarcastic, phone V/O)</i> Oh, hi, Aleph, sorry for calling
at two-thirty AM, how's it going? What <b>is </b>the problem, is the Watcher's
Council National Convention at the Hotel Oakwood or something?
<p>"TAV": Could be.
<p>"ALEPH": Excuse me?
<p>"TAV": But probably not. Put it this way: how many Americans do you
know that wear tweed on a regular basis? 'Cause I just saw a pair come
in on the two-o'clock, and I doubt they're here for a holiday.
<p>"ALEPH": Why the hell would the Watchers want to come to <b>this</b>
hole? It's got all the vampiric activity of a salad sandwich, and that's
<b>after</b>
us showing up.
<p>"TAV": Well, it couldn't possibly have anything to do with the new Slayer,
now, could it?
<p>"ALEPH": The last four Slayers have all been called somewhere in or
near North America. The odds of the next one coming from around here are...
<p>"TAV": <i>(interrupting, for once)</i> Still the same as anywhere else.
Where were <b>you</b> in math class?
<p>"ALEPH": Where were you in <b>English?</b> Narrative imperative, Tav.
If you flip a coin fifty times and it comes up with fifty heads, you expect
a tails, and if it's mystical, you <b>get</b> a tails. It's all tied up
to what people naturally expect.
<p>"TAV": That's great, Aleph. I may be getting a crossbow bolt through
my heart from some idiot in tweed, but at least I'll be able to go down
screaming out the laws of occult probability...
<p>"ALEPH": You really need to work on that sarcasm. Have they noticed
you?
<p>"TAV": Do you hear me talking and think, "moron"? <i>(brief pause)</i>
Don't answer that. I ran for the bathrooms the moment I saw the bastards.
Since I'm still here talking to you...
<p>"ALEPH": OK. You're at the CCI, right? Arrivals lounge bathrooms?
<p>"TAV": Yeah...
<p>"ALEPH": You haven't seen enough movies. That airport hasn't been renovated
in years. Go to the window above the basins, remove and exit.
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>EXT.: AIRPORT. SIDE CAR PARK.</b>
<p><i>(We see a wall, with a row of high, frosted-glass windows in it.
One starts to rattle, and gets pulled into what we quickly figure out is
the women's toilet. Tav pulls herself out, lands awkwardly on the ground,
and looks quickly from side to side in case someone saw her. Someone did
-- brief cut to her POV, some maintenance type is running off, presumably
to the main entrance. Tav takes off after him, and catches up before he
rounds the corner. You can tell because her hands go around his chest,
her fangs go around his neck, blood begins to spurt in time with the man's
dying heartbeat  and the screen goes black. We fade back to a shot
of Tav dragging the body into a conveniently nearby ditch.)</i>

<p><b>INT.: MORGENDORFFER KITCHEN. EARLY MORNING. AS IN FIVE AM OR SO.</b>
<p><i>(Music: "Condescension", Pitchshifter)</i>
<p><i>(We see Daria, looking like she's just got out of bed after a three-day
nap and intends to go back for another three days or so... or would if
it weren't for the nightmares. She stumbles around to a cupboard, fumbles
inside for a glass, fills it with water from the tap, and drinks. Conveniently
enough, the doorbell rings. Daria lets out an indecipherable frustrated
grunt.)</i>
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>INT.: MORGENDORFFER FRONT ROOM, ANGLE TO THE DOOR.</b>
<p><i>(Music continues. Daria opens the front door, still obviously exhausted.
Standing there are Anderson and Travers. She stares at the two Watchers
as if she were a research scientist who's just found out that the lab rats
have started rioting and burnt down the maze.)</i>
<p>DARIA: What... the hell... are you doing... here... at three in the
morning?
<p>ANDERSON: <i>(looks at his watch, smiles brightly as if trying to pacify
Daria)</i> Actually it's ten to fi--
<p>DARIA: <i>(sharply)</i> Shut up. Piss off. I don't care if you're some
<i>(pause)</i>
guardian angels here to enlighten me of my glorious destiny, it can wait
until a godly hour. <i>(moves to slam the door)</i>
<p>TRAVERS: <i>(serious)</i> Look, ma'am, I am very sorry about the time,
but this is of the utmost importance. I was hoping to speak to a... Daria
Morgendorffer?
<p>DARIA: I'm sorry, Daria isn't here right now. Come back in the 
<i>(pause)</i>
afternoon, when she might be awake enough to talk. And when her lawyer
mother is awake, too, so we can negotiate the restraining order. Right
now, she's sick of talking to tweed-clad morons and is going to bed. <i>(slams
the door, begins to stalk off)</i>
<p><i>(A brief wait, then sounds of violence are heard O/S, from outside
the door. Daria, more annoyed than anything else, turns back and opens
the door... and sees the two Watchers, backs to the door, holding a game-faced
vampire at bay with crucifixes. She's wide-eyed, completely shocked, obviously
recognises it from last night.)</i>
<p>DARIA: What do y-- how the hell do you know about those things?
<p><i>(Travers takes a step back to reply, and moves his cross slightly
in the process. The vampire takes the opportunity to leap -- and the Watcher
sidesteps completely. Said bloodsucker goes straight forward and bumps
his head on the threshold, and begins cartoonishly pounding the thin air
there. Anderson fumbles with a stake and plunges it deeply into the vampire's
back, puncturing the right lung. Trouble is, vampires don't need to breathe,
so it has jack-all practical effect.)</i>
<p>ANDERSON: Dammit... no heart...
<p><i>(He heaves to pull it out and has another shot, this time neatly
skewering the left lung. Daria gets the idea, grabs a nearby wooden ruler,
snaps it in two with her fingers and nails the heart with the longer piece.
Obligatory dust explosion.)</i>
<p>DARIA: Now, since I'll never get to sleep after <b>that</b>, I really
hope your explanations are a hell of a lot better than your aim. Come in.
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>EXT.: MORGENDORFFER HOUSE.</b>
<p>DARIA: <i>(V/O)</i> One girl. <i>(singsong)</i> One girl in all the
world. <i>(normal rigid deadpan)</i> Right. Now how about you just take
a nice lie down on the couch and sleep <i>(pause) </i>whatever the hell
it is off.
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>EXT.: CARTER COUNTY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. ABOUT MIDDAY.</b>
<p><i>(Music: "D.A.F.", Powderfinger, play the guitar bridge that starts
about two and a half minutes in)</i>

the passengers disembarking.)</i>
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>INT.: ARRIVALS LOUNGE.</b>
<p><i>(Music continues. We see Sheila standing slightly in front of Willow
and Tara, waiting by a luggage carousel. Sheila looks vaguely disappointed
and sad, while the faces of the other two are unreadable. Willow suddenly
frowns, taking a worried glance at a narrow bracelet on her left arm.
She taps Tara on the shoulder and shows her the bracelet. Tara looks at
it, then a similar one on her arm and raises her eyebrows, looking decidedly
worried.)</i>
<p>WILLOW: Mom... what did you say this town was like again?
<p>SHEILA: <i>(relieved at her daughter's interest in matters less depressing
than the death of her best friend and the general weirdness associated
with her, but still a little suspicious)</i> The complete opposite of 
Sunnydale.
Peaceful, quiet, not much crime.
<p><i>(Willow looks at her bracelet again, then around the room, with a
pointed glance at a door in the corner...)</i>
<p>WILLOW: Mom, I kinda need to go to the bathroom...
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>INT.: AIRPORT TOILETS.</b>
<p><i>(Music continues. Willow and Tara enter, and see a cubicle door wedged
open by a window. A gaping hole in the upper wall indicates said window's
normal location. Willow goes up to the hole and looks out, pulling herself
up slightly, with the occasional glance at her left arm. After a few seconds,
she drops back down.)</i>
<p>TARA: Why would it go through the window?
<p>WILLOW: And then run in one direction, and then the other, and double
back on itself a few times? I guess it really doesn't want to get caught...
<p>TARA: So do we follow it?
<p>WILLOW: It's daylight. No point. Besides <i>(she pulls herself up and
looks around again)</i> I think this just goes out through the parking
lot--
<p>SHEILA: <i>(O/S, shout)</i> Willow? Tara? Are you all right in there?
<p>WILLOW: <i>(shouts)</i> We're fine, Mom! Won't be long!
<p>TARA: But I thought this area didn't have much vampire activity.
<p>WILLOW: It doesn't. Giles said that vampires get attracted to anything
and everything supernatural -- the Hellmouth, other demons, Watchers and
witches if they've got a lot of spell ingredients or enchanted objects,
even. <i>(to Tara's worried look)</i> No, with what we're carrying we won't
attract anything stronger than a demonic mosquito. But New England... it
doesn't have any of that, it's just... boring. Empty.
<p>TARA: So why would they come here?
<p>WILLOW: I'll have to talk to Giles. I mean, unless suddenly some big
occult, mystical thingy suddenly showed up here, then you'd at least get
some drawn in. No matter how intelligent, they'd come up with an excuse
for themselves...
<p>TARA: <i>(nervous)</i> How about... we go and... look around town? Find
out if this is the only one? No offence, but your mom and I...
<p>SHEILA: <i>(O/S, shouts again)</i> Willow! Tara! Are you...
<p>WILLOW: <i>(exasperated yell)</i> Coming, Mom! <i>(quiet, to Tara)</i>
No offence taken. And yeah, we'd better.
<p><i>(They walk out of the toilets, and run into Sheila at the front 
doors.)</i>
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>INT.: THE ZEN. THAT EVENING.</b>
<p><i>(We see Jane and Daria, looking uncomfortable and worried respectively,
watching the band in a setting familiar to anyone who's seen "Jane's 
Addition".)</i>
<p>JANE: Christ, Daria, don't look too happy, it's not like it's picture
day or anything.
<p>DARIA: <i>(<b>Not</b> taking the bait)</i> Remind me how you talked
me into coming here again.
<p>JANE: Well, you said Tom had to meet some high -- well, high<b>er</b>
-- powered relatives or something, and I figured you needed something to
take your mind off this whole bloodsucking fiend, English tweed-clad moron
thing.
<p>DARIA: By taking me to where we met the guy?
<p>JANE: Oh, come on, the band's better this time.
<p>DARIA: Why, did Trent finally figure out Open-D tuning?
<p><i>(Quick cut: Mystik Spiral are on stage, hammering out a dire version
of Skunk Anansie's "It Takes Blood &amp; Guts To Be This Cool (But I'm
Still Just A Clich&eacute;)" and thereby failing on all three counts.
It's still better than "Spite", mind.)</i>
<p>JANE: <i>(change subject)</i> What did they say again?
<p>DARIA: <i>(cocks an eyelid)</i> Before they gave up and left ten minutes
before Mom came down? Went on and on about me being the "Slayer". Vampire
Slaying, capital letters. I think I was supposed to gape at them knowing
that the fanged things turn to dust when you put a wooden thing through
their heart, and then treat every word they in the tweed said as the gospel
truth. Like it is in the movies. I didn't listen, half the time. Too damn
tired, and anyway, this <b>isn't</b> a movie.
<p>JANE: No, it's probably a TV crossover special. Dawson's Creek, that
vampire show on the WB...
<p>DARIA: And that piece-of-crap try-hard-sarcastic animated high school
pseudo-satire on MTV?
<p>JANE: I still swear she sounds like you.
<p>DARIA: <i>(dangerous)</i> So I should start a web site called "No, I'm
<b>not</b>
Janeane Garofalo, Katie Holmes, Bethie from Bethie Against the Vampires,
or <b>anyone</b> from that stupid cartoon on MTV, so would you please stop
saying I am before I have to get out the crossbow?"
<p>JANE: <i>(whoa!)</i> Jeez, all right. C'mon, we're here to relax, remember?
<p><i>(Back to the band -- after completely screwing up the big ending,
someone is seen loudly whispering to Trent (lead vocals and guitar, Jane's
brother, 40-a-day voice, looks like a blend of Jakob Dylan and any number
of well-known male musicians, former crush object of Daria waaay back in
seasons one and two, before this whole Tom debacle) from the side of stage.
Trent looks back at his band mates and says something to shrugs from Jesse
(rhythm guitar) and Nick (bass), and a boisterous idea-sharing from "criminale"
drummer Max. Rest of the band shrugs in agreement.)</i>
<p>TRENT: Just heard... someone backstage seems to think we're a grunged-up
version of INXS. <i>(pause, relaxed)</i> So here's a grunged-up version
of the song she requested. "Never Tear Us Apart".
<p><i>(And with that, the band burst into a song (?) that bears minimal
resemblance to the original. More to the point, it sounds like a blend
of early Pearl Jam, early Clash, and the early-morning cries of a disappointed
vulture arriving too late at the dead donkey.  I guess in the right
hands that combination could sound good, but not in the Spiral's...)</i>
<p>DARIA: And nothing helps you relax like the sound of Michael Hutchence
spinning in his grave...
<p>JANE: <i>(deadpan)</i> Wasn't that a loss to the music industry.
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>INT.: SIDE OF STAGE.</b>
<p><i>(Empty, except for one person, slouching at the world, the one who
stage-whispered to Trent. From this angle, we can see it's Tav.)</i>
<p>"TAV": Those bastards! Michael would be spinning in his grave... <i>(face
takes on an evil grin)</i> Well, I suppose I can always make them regret
it.
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>INT.: DARIA AND JANE.</b>
<p>DARIA: So what are we doing after the earache finish off the set?
<p>JANE: Which they were meant to do ten minutes ago, and judging by the
look on the manager's face will probably be doing at the end of this song?
Meet them backstage, then we'll figure something out. C'mon, these nights
are more fun when they're spontaneous.
<p><i>(Briefly fade the scene, come back with Mystik Spiral nearing the
end of their latest travesty and Jane and Daria getting up. Pan across
to the door, we see Willow and Tara entering.)</i>
<p>TARA: <i>(quietly)</i> So, is there anything?
<p>WILLOW: <i>(looking in a straight line between her bracelet and stage)</i>
No, but I was sure there was <b>something</b> going on with that band...
wait a second. Bloodsucking fiend at eleven-thirty.
<p>TARA: What are we going to do?
<p><i>(pause)</i>
<p>WILLOW: I don't know. All I've got's holy water and a crucifix.
<p>TARA: Same. <i>(sighs)</i> Better than nothing, I guess.
<p><i>(they move on)</i>
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>EXT.: DITCH, NEAR CARTER COUNTY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. STILL 
EVENING.</b>
<p><i>(Music: "Frontier Psychiatrist", The Avalanches)</i>
<p><i>(We see the body of the maintenance guy that got finished off with
part two -- brown hair, full beard, green uniform, deathly-pale skin (funny
that, him being dead and all) and a bloody, nasty-looking wound (note the
comma) around the neck area. He's landed with arms and legs in an awkward
position. Think "skiing accident". A shadow falls over the body. We see
the shadow reach into one pocket, pull out a mobile phone and dial. Zoom
up and out to reveal that the investigative yuppie is in fact...)</i>
<p>TOM: Hello. <i>(pauses, eerily calm, as if nothing were out of the ordinary
-- remember, this is Lawndale, not the Hellmouth, so I'd say this is very
much out of the ordinary)</i> Good. There's been an... unfortunate incident

Hold the shot for a moment, to allow all you Daria/Trent 'shippers to wonder
what diabolical schemes (literally, this being a Buffy crossover) the Evil
Tom must be up to. Just when you've come up with a really good one involving
the Watcher's Council, the aliens, the FBI and Tom's panel beater, he leans
over, puts his hand over his mouth and runs out of shot. Sounds of vomiting
are heard O/S. So much for evil callousness, this is more like plain shock
-- must be his first corpse.)</i>

around briefly.)</i>

<p>"TAV": Well, you see, leatherbrain... <i>(goes game, grabs Trent around
the neck from behind, and makes a slight warning cut in the throat with
a claw)</i> they kinda got scared off. <i>(Jesse looks dumbfounded, well,
more so than usual, Nick plain terrified, Max is gibbering)</i> Now, what's
going to happen is, you four are going to come with me, and...
<p>JANE: <i>(O/S)</i> Yo, Trent! Nice cover! Need some help packing up?
<i>(she

Oh, <b>shit</b>...
<p>"TAV": "Shit" is right. Guess you two are coming with us as well. Everyone
get over in the corner.
<p><i>(Trent takes the opportunity to get a kick to Tav's knee. Tav barely
notices and gives him a shallow-but-painful Wolverine-style gash with her
spare hand across the throat in return. Daria and Jane wince and move quickly
to said corner.)</i>
<p>"TAV": <i>(turns to face the group in the corner and walks toward them)</i>
Now, as I was saying before I was so <i>(pause, tightens her, well,

quietly and calmly co me with me to... AAARGH!

and shoulders from behind. Irate, she throws Trent away -- he flies across
the room and knocks his head on a far table leg -- turns around to face
the threat, claws outstretched, sees said threat, and falls out of game
in shock.)</i>

<p><b>INT.: THE ZEN. SIDE OF STAGE.</b>
<p>WILLOW: ...AMY?! What... the... <i>(trails off)</i>
<p><i>(... "Tav" (vampire Amy Madison), claws outstretched from when 
she threw Trent across the floor,
takes on a very Dariaesque evil smirk. For about ten seconds, and then...)</i>
<p>TAV/AMY: ARAAGH!
<p><i>(She topples forward slightly, so we can see that Daria's planted
a four-inch pocket knife in the back of Tav/Amy's neck up to the hilt,
plenty of blood flowing.)</i>
<p>DARIA: <i>(leaning forward, firmly holding the knife in place, with
a reasonable imitation of calmness, given the situation -- you'd have to
know her well to notice the considerable worry)</i> Now. All I know about
vampires has been gleaned from pulp novels and idiotic Englishmen, so the
scientist in me would really enjoy finding out how vampire healing handles
knife wounds where the knife is held in place. <i>(brief pause)</i> Or
twisted, come to think of it.
<p><i>(Which she does -- very slightly -- to prove her point. Anticlockwise,
if you must know. Tav/Amy screams -- well, more of a wince and a high-pitched
grunt, actually. She lashes back with a high-heeled foot, which Daria dodges
easily and only succeeds in getting them both off-balance. Daria loses
her grip on the knife, Tav/Amy falls to the floor and makes a break for
it while she can... out the back door to relative safety with the knife
still in her neck and the wound bleeding rather more than normal for a
vampire. Pause.)</i>
<p>TARA: Is everyone okay?
<p><i>(Everyone is still in some kind of shock -- Trent picking himself
up off the floor, the rest of the band on the verge of gibbering (except
Max, who's not just on the verge), Daria staring at her bloodstained shirt
and jacket as if they'd suddenly turned into something of Quinn's.)</i>
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>EXT.: SLOANE RESIDENCE. FRONT DRIVEWAY.</b>
<p><i>(Music: The intro to "Conversations" by Seven Medium, but if you
haven't heard that (no surprise) any rock/ballad acoustic guitar intro
will do.)</i>
<p><i>(As seen in "Is It Fall Yet?". Of course, I haven't seen and probably
won't be seeing that any time soon (goddamn ABC), but judging from talk
on the paperpusher's message boards, the place makes the Landon's unhumble
abode (The Daria Database) look like a beachside shack. A large, expensive
luxury vehicle (perhaps a more upmarket version of whatever Lexus Jake
drives with the inverted circle-A for a hood ornament) comes up the driveway
and we see Tom and an older man (uncle? father? grandfather?) get out and
go into the house. Somewhat detracting from the &uuml;ber-gentrified image
of the scene is the police car pulling up behind with an officer interviewing
an exhausted-looking Tom, the cop finally leaving after seemingly doing
a fair amount to exhaust Tom further. He climbs up the stairs (a big and
grandiose set, I imagine) and goes in his front door.)</i>
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>INT.: SLOANE RESIDENCE. LIVING ROOM.</b>
<p><i>(Or whatever fancy name the mansion developers came up with for it.
It's got a TV and associated peripherals, some couches and a phone, and
it all looks fairly expensive, that's all that matters. Music continues
-- if you've heard the song, bring in the electrics about here. Tom picks
up the phone (gasp -- it's not cordless!) and dials a number. Phone split
screen with a tired Helen on the right.)</i>
<p>HELEN: <i>(sickly sweet)</i> Hello? Who's calling?
<p>TOM: It's, uh, Tom. Tom Sloane.
<p>HELEN: <i>(cutting him off, curiosity evident)</i> Oh, you're Daria's
new boyfriend?
<p>TOM: <i>(quickly)</i> Yes, and I was hoping to speak to her? Daria?
Is she there?
<p>HELEN: <i>(thrown)</i> Well, she's, uh, at a friend's right now...
<p>TOM: <i>(equally thrown)</i> You mean Jane's?
<p>HELEN: Er... yes, she's at Jane's.
<p>TOM: <i>(sigh)</i> I'll call her there, then. Goodbye, Mrs Morgendorffer.
<i>(hangs
up)</i>
<p>HELEN: Oh, but... <i>(realizes he's cut her off)</i> Dammit.
<p><i>(Back to the Sloane living room, full screen. Tom sighs again, picks
up the phone and dials the Lanes.)</i>
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>INT.: ANONYMOUS LIVING ROOM (WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT BEFORE).</b>
<p><i>(Music: "Slave to the Wage", Placebo)</i>
<p><i>(About the same size and kind of house as the Morgendorffers', maybe
a little smaller. Does not look lived in -- the floor is bare hardwood,
topped with a small, faded, dusty rug and a long couch done up in the same
dull shade of corporate blue as the foyer we saw in part two. We can see
boarded-up window, and a door behind the couch. A rattle of a handle is
heard and an unseen door (behind the camera) is kicked open with some 
difficulty.
That difficulty is caused by the fact that the kicker, Aleph, is struggling
under the weight of a very bloody vampire Amy. Aleph gently puts her on
the couch on her side, with the knife pointing up, and goes to the first
door and down some stairs, returning with a lukewarm mug of blood and a
large first-aid kit, which she sets down in front of Tav/Amy.)</i>
<p>"ALEPH": You do realise that was a truly moronic thing to do, Tav. Now
that the Slayer -- nobody else could have held on for as long as that unless
they were an amateur wrestler -- the one you worried so much about, knows
we're here. And if she and your old <i>(lightly mocking)</i> "bestest buddy"
Willow stay and chat, they'll know exactly who we are, or at least who
you are. <i>(She pauses, rolls Tav/Amy over onto her stomach, and slowly
and carefully removes the knife, placing it near the mug. Tav/Amy winces
but doesn't make a sound.)</i> I know you like INXS, but did you have to
take it that far?
<p>TAV/AMY: Well, you <b>did</b> <i>(winces again as Aleph dabs some kind
of antiseptic on the knife wound)</i> tell me to go out and kill someone...
<p>"ALEPH": And if I didn't know you'd take it as a compliment I'd say
I hated you.
<p><i>(she produces a thick bandage and dressing and applies to the wound,
with another slight wince from Tav/Amy)</i>
<p>TAV/AMY: Do you really <b>have</b> to do this? That wound's a good four
inches deep and about a centimetre across. Will a normal bandage even help?
<p>"ALEPH": Well, it can't hurt. The faster it heals, the faster you can
get out of here. <i>(matter-of-fact, to Tav/Amy's confused eyebrow)</i>
You can't make a public appearance with that on show. People would talk,
and people would listen, and people would get staked. Specifically, us.
<p>TAV/AMY: So, any bright ideas for what to do? Now that the Slayer knows--
<p>"ALEPH": Well, first I anticipate spending a while figuring out how
to get your blood off the floor and the couch...
<p><i>(Tav/Amy just looks sheepish)</i>
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>INT.: JANE'S BEDROOM.</b>
<p><i>(The original "There She Goes". Something I imagine Tara would like.)</i>
<p><i>(Jane and Daria are sitting on one end of the bed, away from the
stereo, Tara is on the opposite end near Willow who's in front the computer,
facing the bed. Trent comes in the door.)</i>
<p>JANE: Max calmed down?
<p>TRENT: <i>(uneasy)</i> I'm not sure. He seemed quiet enough after he
hit his head the third time.
<p>JANE: Did not need to know that.
<p>TRENT: So... what was it that attacked me?
<p>DARIA: <i>(flat)</i> A vampire, apparently.
<p>TRENT: A vampire. <i>(pause)</i> A vampire that likes <b>INXS</b>?
<p>DARIA: Apparently. <i>(pause)</i> Willow... <i>(not sure how to handle
it)</i>
<p>JANE: <i>(finishing off)</i> You seemed to know the vampire.
<p>WILLOW: We grew up together. Her mother was... never mind. She's...
was... good at witchcraft. And then... there was a demon... made everyone
try and burn her and me and... <i>(sobs)</i>
<p>JANE: <i>(trying too hard to sound comforting)</i> Hey, Willow, it's
okay. If you don't want to talk about...
<p>WILLOW: <i>(resolved)</i> I'm okay. They tried to burn us at the stake,
set up in City Hall and everything, and she turned herself into a rat to
get away. I found her later on, still a rat, and kept her... <i>(spits)</i>
like a pet... I couldn't find a way to change her back, I tried 
<b>every</b>thing.
Then I had to leave the dorm... when we came back, she was gone.
<p>DARIA: <i>(deadpan)</i> So how does a normal, happy, well-adjusted teenager,
albeit in rat form, become a fortyish-looking bloodsucker?
<p>WILLOW: I don't know. Some weird side-effects of the spell...
<p>TARA: Rats age a lot faster than humans...
<p>WILLOW: She gets out, gets turned... I have no idea.
<p>JANE: So what do we do?
<p>WILLOW: <i>(sighs deeply)</i> We'll probably have to... <i>(weeping)</i>
stake her. It's not her in there, it's... the thing that killed...
<p><i>(... and she's cut off by the phone ringing. Convenient, that. Jane,
being closest, picks up. Split the screen... it's Tom. Reprise "Conversations",
with full electric guitars.)</i>
<p>JANE: Hello?
<p>TOM: Oh. Um, hey Jane. <i>(pause)</i> Can I talk to Daria? It's kinda
important.
<p>JANE: <i>(hostile, but not quite as bad as we'd expect)</i> Sure. Here,
Daria. It's your boyfriend.
<p>DARIA: <i>(takes the phone, looking worried, trying to keep up a sarcastic
fa&ccedil;ade)</i> You've called me at the Lanes'. Whose life's in danger?
<p>TOM: Yours, mine, Jane's, everyone in town's. <i>(genuine worry, but
he's not sure how to go about this, lying through his teeth)</i> There
was... well, I used to live out near LA, and my parents were in London...
Some
<b>really</b> sick, sick... ritual murders, puncture the neck, <b>sick</b>
stuff, but there's never been anything like them around here... until last
night. There was one just near the airport, they've just found the body
a few hours ago.
<p>DARIA: One death? There's at least one OD or drunken bar brawler dead
every night on Dega Street, what's the big deal?
<p>TOM: These things... they don't stop at one a night, put it that way.
<p>DARIA: <i>(sarcasm now overblown)</i> So how do I avoid winding up lifeless
and bloodless with fang marks in my neck in an alley somewhere?
<p>TOM: <i>(hard tone, suspiciously suspicious)</i> What do you mean, fang
marks? How much do you know about this?
<p>DARIA: <i>(hard right back at him)</i> How much do <b>you</b> know?
<p>TOM: <i>(realises where he's got himself)</i> Well... oh, God, how can
I put this... You don't read Anne Rice, do you?
<p>DARIA: Got ten pages into <i>Interview With The Vampire</i> and fell
asleep. Then again, it <b>was</b> three a.m. at the time...
<p>TOM: Good. Uhm... Bram Stoker?
<p>DARIA: Yes, and I see where this is going, Tom... I know the things
exist. One of them had a claw at my best friend's brother's throat a couple
of hours ago. If you have information worth hearing, then I am grateful
for it. If not... I'll think of some really graphic punishment for you.
<p>TOM: <i>(in a very fake-sounding jocular tone)</i> You know that vampires
exist?
<p>DARIA: And (faux-Watcher accent) zombies, werewolves, incubi, succubi,
everything you've ever dreaded was under your bed... I sent away for the
Time-Life series, pile of crap that it is. Of course, I didn't actually
<b>believe</b>
any of it until one attacked me in the park a couple of nights ago. How'd
you find out?
<p>TOM: My parents, well... they used to be involved with... a British
organization that helped hunt the things. Still are, informally.
<p>DARIA: This organization wouldn't happen to be called the Council of
Watchers, would it?
<p>TOM: Oh, hell... how did <b>you</b> know about...
<p>DARIA: <i>(sighs)</i> This is too much to explain over the phone. <i>(covers
the mouthpiece)</i> Jane, could you be civil if Tom comes over here? It
looks like <b>he's</b> tied up in this too... with what passes for the
good guys...
<p><i>(Jane gives a reluctant nod. Daria looks relieved.)</i>
<p>DARIA: <i>(into the phone)</i> Tom, is that iron oxide bomb of yours
enough protection from the creatures of the night?
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>INT.: ALEPH AND TAV/AMY'S LIVING ROOM.</b>
<p><i>(Music: "Ashes To Ashes", Faith No More. Bit of sentimental value
here -- it was the first remotely "heavy" song I ever really liked.)</i>
<p><i>(Tav/Amy is sitting up on one (clean) cushion on the couch, with
one missing and the third pushed to the other end.)</i>
<p>TAV/AMY: So, seriously, what are we going to do once the couch is 
reupholstered?
<p>"ALEPH": <i>(enters shot, sits down on other cushion)</i> No idea. Either
get the hell out of Dodge before the Watchers and/or Slayer get us, or
stick around in the hope we'll be able to kill, maim, turn or otherwise
inconvenience them. Of course, it'd help if we knew who she was -- "brown
hair, green jacket" could refer to, well, not everyone, but too many people
to locate by trial and error, Tav.
<p>TAV/AMY: It can't be that hard. I mean, how many people in this town
would carry that kind of knife?
<p>"ALEPH": Oh, only... <i>(pause)</i> No idea, now that I think of it.
But it can't be that good a place to start... <i>(she reaches over and
picks up the knife anyway, and examines it... we see something engraved
on part of the handle. PROPERTY OF JACOB MORGENDORFFER. Aleph does a Mona
Lisa smile, not entirely unlike Daria.)</i> On second thoughts, Tav, could
you go get the phone book?

It's big, it's huge, it's frightening, it's pink, and it's full of animals.
Stuffed. It's the bedroom of Quinn Morgendorffer, Daria's sister, and there's

Daria can do it better than I can... "Her voice is deep, her thoughts are

her "cousin, or whatever." Dressed in sickeningly cute pink, to match her
room. Annoyingly perky voice, constantly trading thinly-masked verbal blows
with Sandi for superiority/leadership of the Fashion Club. Whether she's
actually as shallow as she acts is a subject of much debate on Daria fan

known as the Initiative stuck a V-chip in his head early on in Buffy S4,
rendering him unable to harm anything human or even point a water pistol
at one without getting the headache from Hades, or possibly the aftermath
of one of CB's "crash-outs", if she'd ever tell us what they were... but
I digress even more than usual. Anyway, this forced him to temporarily
seek help from Buffy and Co. and later to have him wind up here. Probably
one of the if not the most popular character the show's ever had, and

so. Oh, appearance? Black duster &agrave; la Canadibrit's Tour of

him onto the ground -- Roger screams, a rather pathetic sound -- and begins

quickly join in, equal numbers on either side of the chest. The screams
get louder, less pathetic. Bits of blood, gore and bone are seen being
flung over the shoulders of the things -- an inhuman howl comes from the
human -- and two of the creatures on either side start hold aloft some
bean-shaped objects like trophies, their companions leaping up and down
as if in celebration. They scamper off, leaving Roger conspicuously not
groaning, and we see what the trophies are -- Roger's kidneys.)</i>

and part wistful. Then he sees Roger's not breathing and takes on what
can only be called a manic grin. Looking round in case the creatures return,
he steps quietly out to the body and checks it for a pulse or any other
signs of life. Finding none, he picks the corpse up, sinks his fangs into
the back of the neck, and feeds messily and eagerly. Dropping the body,
he looks around again for any possible witnesses, and instead sets eyes

audience, but if you can't keep your disbelief suspended I'm not sure what
you're doing reading this fic. Not enjoying it much, that's for certain...)

of mugs of coffee on the table and sits down next to Daria.)</i> You don't
know what you're talking about.
<p>ALEPH/AMY: <i>(rather too much like classic Daria)</i> Excuse me?
<p>DARIA: <i>(can't stay mad)</i> It started when... <i>(drops her head)</i>
It's too much. We -- Jane and I -- were back at the Zen. Backstage. You
know Jane's brother's band, they'd just come off stage, and we saw him...
in a stranglehold, with a claw at his throat.

stops to a quick ssh! gesture from "Aleph".)</i>
<p>TAV/AMY: <i>(quietly)</i> Why'd you want to just knock the parents out,
Aleph? As opposed to, say, killing them as potential threats? This's the
kind of mistake that makes you lose all respect for Bond-movie villains.
<p>ALEPH/AMY: It's supposed to be traditional for vampires to torture and/or
kill their loved ones at the first opportunity after getting turned, so
I figured I'd better play it safe.
<p>TAV/AMY: It is? Damn. So why didn't you...?
<p>ALEPH/AMY: <i>(shrugs)</i> As priceless as the look on Mom's face would
be, it just wasn't worth the trip. But if she asks me to another one of
those anniversary celebrations... <i>(shakes head, is that a shudder?)</i>
And as for you, you told me about "Catherine the Great" and you never asked
about your dad.
<p>TAV/AMY: Well maybe I <b>should</b> have.
<i>(pause)</i> But why do you
want to turn her, anyway? She knows what we are, and... she's a Slayer
for Hecate's sake! What if there's some weird side-effect when they get
vamped?
<p>ALEPH/AMY: <i>(rubbing a small silver ring on her right

relative
I've got who I'd want to spend ten minutes with, let alone eternity. And
she could use the confidence boost.

<p>DARIA: <i>(stands up, drops phone, kicks chair under table, safety in
deadpan)</i> Thanks, Aunt "Aleph", but I want to hold onto my soul for
now. You wouldn't believe how much they're going for on the free market.
<p>ALEPH/AMY: I'm guessing it's enough to cover a pair of contact lenses.
<p><i>(Restart "The Waitress", the chorus, nice and loud...)</i>
<p><i>(Daria looks at Aleph/Amy, incredulous, and each waits for the other
to make the first move. Sounds of a car roaring up the drive...)</i>
<p><i>(Aleph/Amy goes game and leaps forward around the table, lunging
for Daria's head. Specifically, her glasses. Daria dodges... but not quickly
enough. The glasses clatter into a chair leg, and one of the lenses cracks
badly.)</i>
<p><i>(Cut to Daria's POV -- blurry and astigmatic, worse than in Through
A Lens Darkly even. She can just make out an Aleph-shaped blur around the
table, moving quickly towards her, with her running away, at opposite sides
of the table following its edge. Round once, change direction, round 
again...)</i>
<p><i>(Daria moves around the table and near to the wall. Cut underneath
the table, Amy makes a sudden lunge to one side, grabs the edge, and gets
a kick around to Daria's legs. Vampire regains footing, Slayer hits the
floor.)</i>

through, and both move towards Daria, who isn't looking like she'll be
getting up anytime soon.)</i>

steadily clearer with time)</i>
<p>DARIA: Actually... <i>(sweeps "Tav"'s legs out from under her and rolls,
knocking the fallen vampire out of the way and climbing onto her feet as
"Aleph" dives for her and misses.)</i> It has. <i>(Slams the door behind
her)</i>
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>INT.: STAIRCASE.</b>

back and hearing a door downstairs rattle open.)</i>

<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>DOWNSTAIRS: DINING ROOM.</b>
<p><i>(The other door is thrown open. Willow and Tom lead the way, the
latter with a crossbow cocked and ready, the former armed with what looks
like some kind of ceremonial knives. Tara and Jane follow, with assorted
spell paraphernalia and slightly less ceremonial knives respectively. We
just see "Aleph" disappearing the way Daria did, and "Tav" staying for
the face-off.)</i>
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>UPSTAIRS: MASTER BEDROOM.</b>
<p><i>(Music continues. Daria slides in the door and shuts it none too
gently behind her. Seeing her parents apparently alive and uninjured on
the bed, she lets out what might have been a sigh of relief if she wasn't
panting so much (out of desperation rather than exhaustion). Quickly, she
turns the thumblatch on the door and grabs a chair to blockade it. Not
happy with the setup but unable to see anything better, she goes to the
bed to check on her parents, Helen first.)</i>
<p>DARIA: <i>(quiet and urgent)</i> Mom? Mom? <i>(touches her, no response)
</i><b>Mom?</b><i>
(shakes Helen) </i>Wake up, dammit...
<p><i>(f/x: someone knocks on the door)</i>
<p><i>(Daria moves, with speed best depicted with heavy use of a motion
blur, pulling a stake out of her jacket and moving the arm up, to the door,
which gets blown off its hinges by a hip-and-shoulder from "Aleph", and
all in the same fluid movement, Daria's stake plunges into the incoming
vampire's side.)</i>
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>

<p><i>(Music: "Rabbit With Fangs", Magic Dirt)</i>
<p><i>(Jane, Willow, Tara and Tom are at one end of the room. "Tav" is
at the other. A crossbow bolt is embedded in the door ten centimetres to
Tav's left. Neither side looks to be making a move. Can you say stand-off?)</i>
<p>TAV/AMY: Now, I'm kinda new to this whole final battle thing, but isn't
someone supposed to be attacking? <i>(She looks at her opponents. Jane
is smirking to cover up nervousness, Tara and Tom aren't smirking, Willow
is unreadable)</i> Or moving, even? <i>(no reaction, she shrugs)</i> Well,

to move)</i>

<p><i>(Music continues on until further notice. Daria gently pulls the
stake out, replaces it in her pocket and lets "Aleph" slump to the floor,
apparently motionless. Breathing hard, she stares at the vampire, not fully
believing what she sees. Breaking the gaze, she turns back towards the
bed, to check on Jake. "Aleph" opens an eye, then slowly, quietly gets
up, into a sprinter's starting pose. Daria is at the bedside, looking sadly
down at her father. Then "Aleph" jumps for her.)</i>
<p><i>(Daria spins around, her left boot outstretched, swatting "Aleph"
in the head. The vampire half-lands on the far end of the bed, rolls off
and back up into a fighting pose with a growl. She's bleeding badly from
the wound... makes you wonder why neither Buffy nor Faith nor Kendra thought
to wear steel-toe boots...)</i>

of fine, pale orange powder around the room. Tom and Jane have moved in
nice and close to the vampire to play "bad cop, worse cop".)</i>

from Daria. Picking herself up, she sees Daria trying the same move again,
bobs and weaves, and gets a nasty cross of her own into Daria's neck, enough
to get a break in the exchange.)</i>
<p>ALEPH/AMY: Ah, youth. <i>(Daria winces)</i> You don't know much about
fighting, do you?
<p>DARIA: <i>(catching breath)</i> First night out.
<p>ALEPH/AMY: It shows. <i>(goes game, telegraphs a punch to Daria's lower
stomach)</i> Believe me, it shows. <i>(the Slayer only just gets a block
down in time)</i> Aren't you forgetting something? <i>(Daria remembers
her stake, pulls it out, and "Aleph" starts showing a little more 
respect...)</i>

or each other, while Tara and Willow especially are busy trying to ignore
the other three and get on with the spell (p)reparations.)</i>
<p>TOM: <i>(realises Daria'll be happier if he throttles the vampire first)</i>
Is the spell messing with your hearing or something? Where. Is. My. Girlfriend?

"Aleph" is dressed more practically, and dodges out of the way.)</i>
<p>ALEPH/AMY: This really isn't getting anything done.
<p>DARIA: No problem. For me, anyway. What time's sunrise again? <i>("Aleph"
barely bats an eyelid, Daria looks disappointed)</i>
<p>ALEPH/AMY: You think you can hold on that long?
<p>DARIA: <i>(Buffyesque smirk)</i> I don't know. Can you? <i>(sweeps a
leg at the vampire's shins, "Aleph" gets knocked over. Daria moves in,
delivers another kick to the ribcage, and leans over, stake raised...)</i>
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>

clutching at his bleeding right hand) (clearly, triumphant)</i> <i>da

him away.)</i>
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>

it away with some effort, then sweeps her own legs around and takes Daria
down. Standing up, she takes the opportunity to stomp on her niece's kidney
before picking her up and throwing her, with great velocity, at the closed
door behind them. Not shut properly in the first place, it flies open.)</i>
<p><i>(Daria's fall is cushioned by a padded wall -- she's been thrown
into her own bedroom. She coughs,
not just from any dust. Pulling herself back onto her feet with unslayerlike
effort, she moves into a more attacking position, the Slayer instincts
reasserting themselves.)</i>
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>DOWNSTAIRS: DINING ROOM.</b>
<p><i>(Jane moves in with a fist raised. "Tav" blocks with an arm and punches
her once, twice, delivers a kick to her stomach, watchers her fold, and
turns to Willow and Tara.)</i>
<p>TAV/AMY: <i>(shaking head, obligatory villain-demoralises-hero speech)</i>
You never were much of a witch, Willow. I got stuck as a rat for most of
a year and all you could do for me was put in a damn exercise wheel. Then
something changes me back, think it called itself the First or something,
and sends me the way of your Slaying friend's freshly-vamped-from-Hawaii
aunt... I remember it all pretty well, it's the big moments like that which
change your life. <i>(pause, nobody moves)</i> But one thing I do forget...
why am I wasting time playing tell-all biographer? <i>(moves fast and casually,
grabs Tara around the throat)</i> <b>This</b> is more like it. New friend,
Wills?
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>UPSTAIRS: DARIA'S ROOM.</b>
<p><i>(Daria and her aunt, quite simply, start laying into each other.
They're maybe arm's length from one another, the stoic frowns on each face
barely masking a grim kind of determination. Blows fly back and forth at
random... "Aleph" relies on experience to keep her fighting. The Slayer
relies on luck, instinct and the expertise of the good Doctor Marten. Good
enough, clearly, to knock another nasty wound into the vampire's hip area
and send her sprawling into her desk. The computer jolts as "Aleph" looks
up to see...)</i>
<p>DARIA: <i>(very bitter sarcasm, stake ready)</i> Ah, the aged. I shouldn't
have done that, should I? Arthritis and all that...
<p>ALEPH/AMY: <i>(blithe)</i> Ah, youth. One thing you're gonna have to
learn... It's not smart to gloat until you've <i>(goes game, roars,
snap kicks into Daria's wrist)</i> <b>finished the job!</b>
<p><i>(The stake goes flying off at an angle and clatters near the door.
Daria hesitates momentarily, glancing in mild shock at her empty hand,
and in that moment "Aleph" is back on her feet, with the Slayer in a bear
hug, and fangs in her right shoulder. Blood spurts wildly. Daria struggles
violently, and in one sudden jerk manages to tear her shoulder out from
under her aunt's fangs, which take a fair chunk of her flesh out with them
and brush the still-bleeding wound in Aleph's forehead over the bite. Spitting
the flesh out, the vampire pulls pack, and briefly looks over her now tired,
injured niece. Then she surges back in, smashing Daria into the wall, not
allowing for any resistance as she starts feeding again.)</i>
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>DOWNSTAIRS: DINING ROOM.</b>
<p><i>(Tara, unable to see her assailant or, for that matter, breathe very
well, is quietly trying not to whimper, her face absolute fear. "Tav" merely
grins at Willow like the cat that swallowed the low-fat non-dairy cream
substitute.)</i>
<p>WILLOW: Put her down!
<p><i>(Jane is still on the floor, and sees Tom see where the vampire's
attention is directed and quietly start edging his way around the room.)</i>
<p>TAV/AMY: <i>(after a long pause) </i>There's so much I could say to
that. <i>(goes game and makes a shallow cut in Tara's neck)</i> But I'll
stick with a simple "no". <i>(slowly licks the blood from the wound)</i>
<p>WILLOW: <i>(pulls a stake from a pocket, waves it threateningly)</i>
Put... her... down.
<p>TAV/AMY: No... no... <i>(growls)</i> NO! <i>(puts her fangs in the cut,
starts to feed)</i>
<p>WILLOW: <i>(to Tom)</i> Now. <i>(Tom, now directly behind "Tav", tries
to crash-tackle the vampire and is able to disorient the vampire enough
for Willow to drop the stake, jump in, and get Tara out of harm's way.)</i>
<p>TOM: <i>(breathless)</i> Aaergh...
<p><i>(We see him wresting with the vampire. Very close, very personal,
very unpleasant. They keep rolling on the floor like that, someone might
get the wrong idea. Jane picks herself up off the floor and starts bashing
at the pair, aiming to get "Tav" off Tom. She succeeds... the vampire goes
rolling towards Willow, who's still nursing Tara. With a cry, the vampire
extends her claws and somehow pulls herself up to attack her former classmate.
Willow, moving too fast to think, scrabbles for a stake and rakes it across
Tav's chest. The vampire's sheer momentum pushes her onto the stake just
as it goes near her heart, and a cloud of dust scatters over Willow and
Tara.)</i>

Jane casts her eyes in the direction of the door the other Amy went 
through...)</i>

the wall. Lightly cutting part of her neck with a claw, she gently pulls
her niece's mouth over the cut.)</i>
<p><b>CUT TO:</b>
<br><b>INT.: UPSTAIRS HALLWAY.</b>

stairs and, by unspoken agreement, go to one door each. Jane sees the damage
to Quinn's door and moves quickly that way, Tara goes to the master bedroom,
Willow the Morgendorffer daughters' shared bathroom, and Tom waits a little
before approaching Daria's room.)</i>
