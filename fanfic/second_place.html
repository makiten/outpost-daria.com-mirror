<p class=MsoNormal>Daria stood by her best friend as she accepted second place.
The tears she was holding back were not tears of joy, but of tremendous sorrow.
Though Daria had never seen her best friend so happy, Jane didn’t deserve
second place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria thought back to when they first met, in the
self-esteem class, wondering if in fact, it was truly lack of self-esteem that
made Jane think this was all she could want, all she deserved. Trent stood opposite Daria and she caught his eye. He seemed genuinely happy for Jane, and
Daria wondered if there was something he understood better as Jane’s brother
than she did as her friend.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Daria guess what?” Jane’s voice was high-pitched with
barely contained excitement as she told Daria the news over the phone.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“That’s wonderful Jane. I’m so happy for you!” Daria
hated to lie to her friend, but she sounded so happy and Daria couldn’t bear to
take that away from her. She vowed then and there her opinion would go with her
to the grave.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria turned back to the ceremony. It was almost over. The
party after would be a raging success. After all, Quinn had helped plan it, and
no one threw a party quite like Quinn. A single tear leaked from Daria’s eye,
no match for the freely flowing tears from Jane’s.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Jane’s were tears of joy. She held out her hand and
accepted second place with nothing but the utmost happiness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria’s heart clenched as the man who would always put Jane
second, who would cancel dinners and break promises, who undoubtedly loved Jane
with all his heart, but would never think of her first, slid the small gold
band on her finger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“With this ring, I thee wed.” There were tears in his eyes,
too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane had always defended him, his treatment of her. <i>Oh,
he’s just trying to get established. After that we’ll have more time together.
It’s great like this anyway, I have him, but still freedom to do what I want.
It’s perfect Daria, really. I couldn’t be happier.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And he wasn’t a bad guy. He actually reminded Daria of her
mom, a workaholic, but with good intentions. And there was no doubt he loved
Jane more than anything. But his job would always come first, and it broke
Daria’s heart that Jane thought this was okay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She loved Jane like a sister. And Jane didn’t deserve second
place.</p>
