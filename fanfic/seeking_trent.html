color:aqua'>Jane: I waded through his room three times and the guys are here <span

<p><span style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Verdana;

try to report a Lane as a missing person they’d laugh their collective <span

didn’t have the book. He said he’d already tried the other guys, and he wanted
to look in the tank. I told him to go ahead and look and I went back to my soap
op- I mean my Jackie Chan movie.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:aqua'>(Jane brushes past Monique and into a nicely decorated living room
with several chairs and a big overstuffed couch. There are large potted plants
on end tables on either side of the couch and nicely framed photos on the
walls. An archway leads to the <span class=GramE>kitchen,</span> two more doors
lead from the living room. Both doors are closed)</span></p>

color:aqua'>Monique: (Hurries in after them and starts picking up papers and a
few other things cluttering up the living room) Have a seat. I’ll just get you
something to drink.</span></p>

color:aqua'>(She rushes into the kitchen without waiting for a reply. Jane and
Daria look at each other for a moment then they have a seat on the couch)</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:aqua'>(Monique is already gone to the kitchen. Daria and Jane look around
the room. Daria has a thoughtful look on her face. They don’t really see
anything out of place. Suddenly, <span class=SpellE>Daria’s</span> face gets a
look of dawning realization, and she turns to Jane as if to speak; however,
Monique returns with a tray.) </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:aqua'>Monique: I hope herbal tea is okay.</span></p>

color:aqua'>(Daria and Jane both nod and take a cup)</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:aqua'>Jane: Anyway, <span class=GramE>Like</span> I was saying, we were
looking for Trent. No one has seen him since Monday afternoon.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:aqua'>Daria: At least no one who will admit it. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Verdana;

on the wall)</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:aqua'>Jane: Anyway, if behind the music is over, Trent is missing and his
<span class=GramE>car’s</span> gone. He may be flaky, but he’d never leave town
without telling me first.</span></p>

color:aqua'>(Jane and Daria both start drinking their tea.)</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:aqua'>Jane: (Seems more relaxed) So we were just wondering if maybe Trent
had said or done anything that might give us a clue as to were he could be.</span></p>

color:aqua'>(Daria seems to be staring off into la-la land and Jane is not far
behind both seem very sleepy, Jane even goes as far as to snuggle down into the
sofa.)</span></p>

color:aqua'>Monique: Well June Like I said before I haven’t see or heard from
him in quite a while.</span></p>

drifting off.)</span></p>

color:aqua'>Monique: Now he’s all mine. (Pan from Monique around the room until
the view stops on the bed. Here we see Trent lying on the bed his hands cuffed

don’t get any ideas you <span class=SpellE>pervs</span> so says the perverted
kettle calling the skillet black.})</span></p>

She sits down and logs in. After a few moments some one reading over her
shoulder would see this: LUVSLAVES.com classifieds and bulletin board. Monique
goes to the bulletin board)</span></p>

class=SpellE>gonna</span> drink some of your ’’herbal” tea after watching you
run to the kitchen with <span class=SpellE>Trent’s</span> song book like all
the hounds of hell were after you. Even Quinn wouldn’t be that stupid.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Verdana;

<p><span style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Verdana;

lately I have and I recognized it. And I poured your little herbal cocktail in
to one of your plants when I looked at your picture. I couldn’t warn Jane but I
knew you wouldn’t dare hurt <span class=SpellE>Trent’s</span> sister.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Verdana;

color:aqua'>Daria: (Answering phone) No Eric, this is her daughter. She’s at
home, call her there. No I can’t just take a message. (She hangs up the phone
and resumes talking with Monique.) So how do you want to do this; spilling your
guts in typical Scooby <span class=SpellE>Doo</span> fashion, or would you rather
reveal your diabolical plan while you try to kill me, just like a Bond villain?</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:aqua'>Monique: I just wanted to keep Trent, and I would have him, if it
wasn’t for you, you nosy BITCH!</span></p>

color:aqua'>Monique: (ignoring her) I lost an earring in the tank, on the way
home from a gig. I went to get it back and found <span class=SpellE>Trent’s</span>
songbook. I just wanted to see what he had written about me, I hadn’t heard any
thing new since he wrote ICEBOX WOMAN for me. But what do I see? He’s writing
about someone else, some new muse who’s inspiring him. I couldn’t stand it. I
took his damn book and left him a note in the tank, telling him to come and get
it. A little ‘’herbal' tea and a set of cuffs, and he was mine. That is until
his brat <span class=GramE>sister,</span> Jean and her friend came looking into
things that don’t concern them. (She suddenly rushes at Daria, who instinctively
defends herself. Daria gets off a lucky punch, and Monique falls to the floor
unconscious. )</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Verdana;

you slept through our gallant rescue. </span></p>

ever short on cash you now know how to knock me out and sell me to the highest
bidder.</span></p>

these days? </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:aqua'>Jane: Trent knew Monique’s password, apparently she talks to
herself while surfing, so I logged on last night just to see what we’re worth. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:aqua'>Jane: Well I’m now the property of some guy who goes by <span

wanted me for my artistic abilities. He wanted me to do drawings for his web
site. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:aqua'>Jane: You’re not going to believe it, but who ever bought you is
from Lawndale. He bid over a thousand dollars and said he’d go as high as it
takes. Guess what his screen name was? </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
