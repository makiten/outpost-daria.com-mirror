Self Less
<br>By Thomas
<p>Thanks to Steve Brown for helping me with my grammar. And to Medea for beta reading it.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(Lawndale High. Kevin and Brittany are having lunch in the cafeteria.
Brittany is staring at a piece of paper)
<p>Brittany: If X is the number of guests, and A is how much food they
can eat... and B is how much they can drink. Decorations. Are they a C
or a Y?
<p>Kevin: But, babe, you don't need to do math outside the classroom.
<p>Brittany: But I do. Oh no, why did I believe my dad when he said I'd
gotten old enough to arrange my own parties?
<p>Kevin: Gee, babe, maybe you should do like I do, and let the coach do
your thinking for you.
<p>Brittany: (Irritated) The coach can't help me with this. But maybe...
<p>(Cut to Daria and Jane's table)
<p>Jane: Have you ever wondered why we're still alive?
<p>Daria: Must be a curse of some sort.
<p>Jane: No. I mean when we eat the food in this cafeteria every day.
<p>Daria: Maybe because the meat is always fresh. The cook hunts rats.
Uh oh, stupidity at 9 o'clock.
<p>Brittany: (Sits at their table) Hi, guys. Can you help me arrange a
party?
<p>Daria: Parties are against my religion.
<p>Jane: Uhm, maybe. What's it about?
<p>Brittany: I'm holding a party next weekend to celebrate the football
team's latest victory. But I'm having trouble figuring out what to order
and how much and stuff.
<p>Jane: Yeah. I can help you. I did a school dance once. The one with
Jackson Pollock.(1)
<p>Brittany: You did that? Wasn't that Quinn?
<p>Jane: She just took all the glory.
<p>Brittany: (Angry) Yes, she would do something like that wouldn't she?
Did you know she broke my crystal bullhorn? (2)
<p>Daria: Other than I saw it happen? No.
<p>Brittany: I tell you, Quinn is someone who won't get invited to *my*
party. It's hard enough for me to control myself when I see her in the
hallway. But if she showed up at my party, I'd do horrible things.
<p>Jane: I like you so much better now. But if I have to help you, I want
you to invite Daria.
<p>Daria: Excuse me?
<p>Brittany: I was only going to invite popular people... but why not.
I'll send you an invitation, Daria.
<p>Daria: Brittany, could you put your hands over your ears? Jane and I
need to have a little discussion.
<p>Brittany: (Confused) Uhm, okay. (puts her hands to her ears)
<p>Daria: Explain yourself. What have I done to deserve the punishment
of going to one of Brittany's parties? And why are you being so friendly
towards her all of a sudden?
<p>Jane: Mom and dad left the country last week. But before they did, they
left a note asking me and Trent to clean the house while they were gone.
<p>Daria: How convenient.
<p>Jane: I know. Unfortunately I can barely overcome cleaning my own room,
and Trent can't even do that. Not to mention the whole house. So we've
decided to call an industrial cleaning service.
<p>Daria: And this relates to you helping Brittany with her party how?
<p>Jane: Money. If we have to pay both the mortgage and for an industrial
cleaning service, we won't have anything to eat.
<p>Daria: So if a certain *someone* helps Brittany with her party. A certain
*someone* could order more food than the guests could possibly eat.
<p>Jane: And then a certain *someone* could take the leftovers home with
her in the Tank.
<p>Daria: Smart. By why me?
<p>Jane: At Brittany's party I'll be surrounded by people I don't like.
I could do with an exception.
<p>Daria: Nice try, but flattery will get you nowhere.
<p>Jane: Didn't you hear her say Quinn wasn't invited?
<p>Daria: That didn't escape my attention.
<p>Jane: So how would Quinn feel if you got invited but not her?
<p>Daria: At times like this I feel like adopting you.
<p>Jane: Me a Morgendorffer? You hate me that much?
<p>Daria: Uhm. Point taken.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(A couple of days later. Daria's room. Daria is sitting at her computer.
Quinn comes in)
<p>Quinn: Where is it? Did you take it?
<p>Daria: You mean the sign at my door asking you to knock before entering?
<p>Quinn: Oh, ha, ha. My invitation to Brittany's party. (looks at Daria's
desk, sees Daria's invitation) There it is. (takes it)
<p>Daria: Quinn...
<p>Quinn: I can't believe you'd sink that low. Stealing my mail.
<p>Daria: Quinn!
<p>Quinn: We had a meeting in the fashion club. And the others started
talking about Brittany's party. And I just sat there and had, like, *no*
idea what they were talking about. Sandi even suggested I might not have
been invited. But I knew...
<p>Daria: Quinn!!
<p>Quinn: ... I had to have been invited, because who ever heard of a party
without *me* being invited. And then you steal my mail just to embarrass
me.
<p>Daria: QUINN!!!
<p>Quinn: (Taken aback) What?
<p>Daria: Look at it. It's not your invitation.
<p>Quinn: That's ridiculous. (reads it) To Daria Morgendorffer??? But that's
a mistake.
<p>Daria: Why? It's not like she hasn't invited me to one of her parties
before.
<p>Quinn: Oh, now I get it. This really is my invitation. Brittany confused
my name with yours. How stupid of her.
<p>Daria: No, Quinn. It's not your invitation. Brittany didn't invite you.
I know because she told me.
<p>Quinn: (Nervous) But that can't be. Everyone popular has been invited.
I'm popular.
<p>Daria: You're also the one who destroyed her crystal bullhorn last time
you went to her house. That's why you weren't invited.
<p>Quinn: Not me... But you... Why?
<p>Daria: (Sigh) Jane is helping her arrange it. She got me an invitation.
(takes the invitation from Quinn and lays it back on her desk)
<p>Quinn: You mean... I really haven't been invited?
<p>Daria: I meant that the first time I said so.
<p>(Quinn plops down on Daria's floor. She has an empty look in her eyes)
<p>Daria: Quinn?
<p>(Daria waves a hand in front of Quinn's eyes. Quinn doesn't react)
<p>Daria: This is getting creepy. I'm going to over to Jane's.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(Jane's room. Jane is painting a picture. Daria is lying on Jane's bed
staring at the ceiling)
<p>Daria: Can I ask you something?
<p>Jane: Would it help if I said no?
<p>Daria: No. Do you think I've gone soft?
<p>Jane: (Cocks a quizzical eye towards Daria) What gave you that idea?
<p>Daria: Earlier today when Quinn found out that I, but not her, had been
invited to Brittany's party. She looked like she had shell-shock. I've
never seen her so miserable before. But somehow it wasn't as much fun as
I thought it would be. I'm not even sure it was fun.
<p>Jane: Did you try to comfort her?
<p>Daria: Of course not.
<p>Jane: Well, maybe it's just that as you've gotten older, your sense
of humor has changed. Quinn-torment just isn't that big a part of your
life anymore. Like when you're a little girl you play with dolls. But then
someday you get tired of it.
<p>Daria: I never played with dolls.
<p>Jane: Okay, bad example. But you know what I'm getting at.
<p>Daria: So it's because I've gotten older. It's got nothing to do with
me getting soft?
<p>Jane: You soft? Certainly not.
<p>Daria: Thanks.
<p>Jane: (Voiceover) She's getting soft.
<p>Daria: (Voiceover) She thinks I'm getting soft.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(Quinn's room. Quinn is doing her homework. The door opens. Daria comes
in)
<p>Quinn: What do you want?
<p>Daria: You know perfectly well what I want. My invitation. It was lying
on my desk but now it's gone. You're the only one with a motive to take
it. I want it back.
<p>Quinn: Daria, let me explain.
<p>Daria: No. Give it back or I'll start looking for it myself. And I'll
take a knife to your stuffed animals if I have to.
<p>Quinn: (Surprised) You know about my secret hiding places?
<p>Daria: Since a year ago when your stuffed dog became pregnant overnight.
You're supposed to remove some of the fillings before hiding stuff in those
things you know.
<p>Quinn: You mean ruin them? But they're my ...
<p>Daria: (Smirk) Friends?
<p>Quinn: Never mind. Look, if you'll just let me explain.
<p>Daria: You have two minutes before dissection begins.
<p>Quinn: You got invited because Jane is helping Brittany arrange her
party, right?
<p>Daria: Right.
<p>Quinn: So Brittany has told the Rent-a-cop to let Jane come and go as
she pleases. Right?
<p>Daria: That would seem like the logical thing to do. So I guess not.
<p>Quinn: Daria, please. Don't you see? You don't *need* an invitation.
You can have Jane smuggle you in. Like you're a servant or something.
<p>Daria: Can't I be an executioner instead?
<p>Quinn: Uuuh! Then I can use *your* invitation to get in. I'll just tell
the Rent-a-cop I'm you. Got it?
<p>Daria: Once more I'm surprised at how you can suddenly turn into Thomas
Edison when it comes to matters of your popularity. But the answer is still
no.
<p>Quinn: Fine. How much do you want?
<p>Daria: I want a knife so I can start gutting your stuffed animals.
<p>Quinn: You don't want money?! (whining) Is me suffering that important
to you?
<p>Daria: (Sighs) You get invited to more parties than you can overcome.
What makes this one so important?
<p>Quinn: What do you mean important? This is the party event of the month.
I *have* to be there. Every popular student at school has been invited
but me. What do you think this will make me look like?
<p>Daria: Unpopular?
<p>Quinn: See! You *do* understand! Daria, I *have* to be there.
<p>Daria: Why don't you just tell people that you've been invited, but
you can't go because you're not feeling well, or you got grounded.
<p>Quinn: Even Tiffany won't fall for that. My friends are bound to get
suspicious. Don't you see? They'll ask Brittany if I was invited or not.
<p>Daria: What I don't see is why you refer to those people as friends.
But I suppose that's part of your world -- not mine. Now give me back my
invitation.
<p>Quinn: (Defeated) You want me to beg, don't you? You want to see me
lie before you on my crying knees.
<p>Daria: Your "crying knees"? Boy this has really gotten to you. Look,
Quinn, Brittany is mad at you. And she's bigger and stronger than you.
If she finds you at her party you'll be leaving it in an ambulance.
<p>Quinn: I guess I hadn't thought of that. You really think Brittany would
beat me up?
<p>Daria: Positive.
<p>Quinn: Figures. (goes to her stuffed dog and pulls the invitation out
of its mouth, hands it to Daria) Here.
<p>Daria: You'll forgive me for not thanking you.
<p>Quinn: That's okay. I just hadn't thought you'd be worried about me.
<p>Daria: What do you mean "worried about you"?
<p>Quinn: That you don't want me to get beaten up.
<p>Daria: Uhm. That's not why I don't want you to go... I'm... Mom will
blame me. That's it. I don't want you to get beaten up because mom would
blame me for letting it happen.
<p>Quinn: Oh. (voiceover) She's worried about me.
<p>Daria: (Voiceover) She thinks I'm worried about her.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(At dinner. Quinn is dressed as for a funeral. Black dress and a veil)
<p>Jake: (Nervous) Uhm. Did anyone die?
<p>Quinn: Only my popularity.
<p>Jake: Who?
<p>Daria: She means her cat.
<p>Jake: How sad. Cheer up, kiddo. We'll go to the pet store tomorrow and
buy you a new one.
<p>(Helen starts massaging her temples)
<p>Daria: Are you sure that's a good idea, dad? I don't even see why Quinn
should have so many cats. Selfish, Fashion-obsessed and Only-child are
still alive.
<p>(Quinn sends Daria a dirty look)
<p>Jake: (Surprised) You have three cats, Quinn? They're house trained
I hope.
<p>Helen: (Irritated) Daria is being sarcastic, Jake. We don't have any
cats.
<p>Jake: We don't? Whew, for a moment I thought I didn't know my girls.
<p>Daria: No cats, just our dog, Clueless.
<p>Jake: (Surprised) We have a dog?
<p>Helen: Daria, go to your room.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(That evening. Daria's room. Daria is laying on her bed. She's reading
"The Rebel Angels" by Robertson Davies. There's a knock on the door)
<p>Daria: No visitors allowed. I'm in isolation.
<p>(Helen comes in)
<p>Helen: I talked with Quinn.
<p>Daria: Did she make sense to you?
<p>Helen: Yes, she did. Daria, can't you think of a way to help her?
<p>Daria: Why should I? All that's happened is that she hasn't been invited
to a party, but she treats it like it's the end of the world. I'm having
a hard enough time not making fun of her over it.
<p>Helen: And I'm glad you haven't. Look, for you it's just a party. But
for Quinn it's something else. For the first time in her life she's the
one who didn't get invited.
<p>Daria: So? There will be other parties. She'll get over it.
<p>Helen: Are you sure? And if other people also get the idea not to invite
Quinn. Then what?
<p>Daria: I suppose she would have to learn not to rely on her popularity.
As she *will* have to learn sooner or later.
<p>Helen: True. And she's beginning to learn that. She's doing a lot better
in school now. But I'd rather she learn it gradually instead of the shock
therapy that could result from this. This has really gotten to her you
know.
<p>Daria: I know. I just don't see what its got to do with me.
<p>Helen: (Sigh) In my line of work you often have to rely on favors. You
know what I mean?
<p>Daria: Corruption?
<p>(Helen sends Daria a killer look. Daria swallows)
<p>Helen: No. Like when you do people a favor but don't ask for anything
in return. Then when you need something done they'll owe you.
<p>Daria: Nice theory. But I doubt Quinn would repay a favor.
<p>Helen: So you're saying that if Quinn would repay a favor, you'd be
willing to help her?
<p>Daria: You're good. When you want to, you can be really good.
<p>Helen: If you do find a way to help her, I'll make sure Quinn understands
she owes you. And I think it'll be good for her to know you want to help
her.
<p>Daria: But I don't want to help her. I'm only doing it because you twisted
my words.
<p>Helen: Sure, sweetie. (voiceover) She wants to help Quinn.
<p>Daria: (Voiceover) She thinks I want to help Quinn.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(Next day. Sloane's residence. Tom and Daria are in the TV room. Daria
is lying in Tom's arms)
<p>TV: He loves rare animals, so he eats them for dinner! Panda barbecue,
next on Sick Sad World.
<p>Tom: My great grandfather did a lot of that. Maybe it's a documentary.
<p>Daria: Mmmm.
<p>Tom: This is where you're supposed to make a snide comment of some sort.
What's eating you?
<p>Daria: Quinn didn't get invited to a party at the Taylor's house. Now
she fears the end of her popularity.
<p>Tom: Maybe you didn't understand my question. What's eating *you*?
<p>Daria: (Small smile) My mom wants me to help her. I got invited you
see. The problem is that Brittany would kill Quinn on sight.
<p>Tom: I've met the Taylor's at the country club. (sigh) Novou riche.
<p>Daria: You know, I had almost managed to convince myself that you and
your family isn't snobbish.
<p>Tom: And I'd like to think we're not. But when it comes to avoiding
the Taylor's you need every excuse you can get.
<p>Daria: I should be offended by what you just said. But I met Ashley-Amber
(3).
<p>Tom: Can't you manipulate Brittany into inviting Quinn somehow?
<p>Daria: I might. But the thought of manipulating her into doing something
she doesn't want to bothers me. She's one of the few people at school who's
been friendly towards me. She even tried helping me once (3).
<p>Tom: I see. How about using hypnosis then? Make her believe she can't
see Quinn.
<p>Daria: "Can't see Quinn". Tom, that's brilliant.
<p>Tom: No, that was a joke. And I seriously doubt it's even possible to
use hypnotic suggestions on someone with an IQ like Brittany's.
<p>Daria: Not that. Costumes. I'll get Brittany to turn it into a costume
party. Then Quinn can wear a mask.
<p>Tom: Good thinking. And you'll dress as what?
<p>Daria: Uhm. You know how using your family connections goes against
my principles?
<p>Tom: And mine. But you get used to it. What is it you need that's not
part of the usual inventory of a Rent-a-costume store?
<p>Daria: Replicas of a classical Greek helmet and shield.
<p>Tom: That's possible. One of dads friends has a thing for the old Greece.
The shield -- should it come with a Medusa head on it?
<p>Daria: This is why I like you so much.
<p>(Tom and Daria kiss)
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(Lawndale High. The hallway. Daria walks up to Brittany)
<p>Daria: Hi. How's the party coming along?
<p>Brittany: Hi, Daria. I'm not sure. Jane wants to do everything by herself.
Can you understand why she doesn't want me around to help her?
<p>Daria: Artists can be like that. She's probably grumpy because she wanted
the party to be something special instead of it being just like every other
party. One of those you forget you went to the next day.
<p>Brittany: Forget?! But I want people to remember my parties.
<p>Daria: I suppose it would help if you had a theme. Like if it were a
*costume* party.
<p>Brittany: A costume party. What a great idea. I've got to tell everyone.
(runs off)
<p>Daria: (Voiceover) Manipulated in less than 60 seconds. Sometimes I
scare myself.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(Morgendorffer residence. Jake, Helen, Daria and Quinn are standing
in the livingroom. Daria is dressed as the goddess Athena. White robe,
sandals, a helmet, and a shield with a picture of a Medusa head on it.
Quinn is dressed as soldier, she's holding a gas mask in her hand)
<p>Jake: You look adorable, kiddos.
<p>Daria &amp; Quinn: Thanks, dad.
<p>Jake: About your costume, Quinn. You do realize that when your mother
and I were young, we rallied against the military. I hope ...
<p>Helen: It's just a costume, dear. Quinn isn't trying to rebel against
what we stand for.
<p>Daria: You stand for something?
<p>Helen: Thin ice, Daria.
<p>Jake: And you, Daria. You do know the Statue of Liberty carries a torch
and not a shield.
<p>(Daria gets a pained expression on her face)
<p>Helen: Don't be silly, Jake. Can't you see Daria is dressed as ... Uhm.
<p>Quinn: The goddess Athena.
<p>Daria: (Surprised) You know?
<p>Quinn: I read a book on Greek mythology. It's really interesting. The
Greek gods are this totally dysfunctional family. Lots of incest. Brother
marrying sister and that kind of stuff. They rape mortals left and right.
And when they get mad at some poor mortal, you have, like, no idea how
nasty they can get.
<p>(Jake looks terrified)
<p>Daria: Uhm, dad. The Greek gods are mythology. It's not a cult.
<p>Jake: (Nervous) But do you have to dress like someone who rapes and
...
<p>Quinn: Don't be silly, dad. Athena is the noble one. She doesn't do
that kind of stuff. When she was born, Hefaistos cracked Zeus skull open
so she could get out. You see she ...
<p>Daria: Maybe we should just leave. I'm itching to throw you into the
trunk.
<p>(Daria and Quinn start to leave)
<p>Quinn: Can't you be to one who hides in the trunk? I could tell the
Rent-a-cop I'm you.
<p>Daria: No. And if you bring that up again I'll find a bumpy road.
<p>(The door shuts)
<p>Jake: The trunk. That's sarcasm, right?
<p>Helen: (Sigh) I wish.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(At Brittany's party. Jane, dressed as Van Gogh, a smock and a bandage
over her left ear, is standing at some tables filled with food. Brittany
walks over to her. She's is wearing a late eighteenth century dress and
a big white wig)
<p>Brittany: How do you like my costume, Jane? I'm Marie Antoinette.
<p>Jane: Lovely. And you have no need to worry. There's enough bread for
everyone, no need to tell people to eat cake.
<p>Brittany: (Doesn't get it) So I see. But haven't you ordered too much.
How can we eat all that?
<p>Jane: Oh, it'll get eaten alright.
<p>Brittany: Have you seen Kevvie?
<p>Jane: Try the gorilla. I noticed it's carrying a football under its
arm.
<p>Brittany: Oh no, that couldn't be Kevvie. I told him to come as Louis
the sixteenth.
<p>Jane: (Voiceover) Should I tell her? It's a little early for entertainment.
(outloud) Then I haven't seen him.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(The gorilla walks over to Daria)
<p>Kevin: Hi, babe.
<p>Daria: I had a feeling that would be you. (pause) Excuse me. Did you
just call me "babe"?
<p>Kevin: Oh yeah. You're not usually a babe. But with that Xena costume,
you're totally hot.
<p>Daria: It's Athena, Kevin.
<p>Kevin: That's what I said. Xena.
<p>Daria: This is going to be a long night.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(Quinn walks over to Sandi and Tiffany. Sandi is dressed as a pirate.
Tiffany as a tiger)
<p>Quinn: (Takes her gas mask of) Hi, guys.
<p>Sandi: Oh, there you are *Quinn*. I was beginning to wonder if you'd
been invited.
<p>Quinn: But, Sandi. Who ever heard of a party without *me* being invited.
<p>Sandi: (Sigh) That's true I suppose.
<p>(Stacy walks over to them. She's dressed as Quinn usually does. Blue
jeans and a blouse with a butterfly on it. Her hair has been dyed red)
<p>Quinn &amp; Sandi: Oh, no.
<p>Tiffany: This is soooo wrong.
<p>Stacy: How do you like my costume? I look just like Quinn.
<p>Sandi: Stacy. Do me a favor will you? Don't talk to me tonight.
<p>Stacy: You mean you don't like my costume?
<p>Sandi: I said *don't* talk to me.
<p>Quinn: Stacy look here ...
<p>(Brittany walks over to them)
<p>Quinn: Uhm. I suddenly remember being thirsty. (puts her gas mask on
and leaves in a hurry)
<p>(Brittany grabs Stacy by the shoulders and lifts her up so they are
face to face)
<p>Brittany: (Furious) What're you doing here, Quinn? You have a lot of
guts to show your face here *uninvited* after you broke my crystal bullhorn.
I am *so* going to beat you up now.
<p>Stacy: Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep!
<p>Sandi: That's not Quinn. It's Stacy dressed *as* Quinn.
<p>Brittany: Oh, so it is. (puts a nervous Stacy down) I'm sorry, Stacy.
I thought you were Quinn.
<p>Stacy: (Hyper ventilating) Hhhhhhh, hhhhhhh, hhhhhhh.
<p>Sandi: But if you feel that way about Quinn, why did you invite her?
<p>Brittany: Boy, you fashion girls can be really stupid sometimes.
<p>Sandi: What's that supposed to mean?
<p>Brittany: Can't you see this isn't Quinn? It's Stacy.
<p>Sandi: So Quinn hasn't been invited?
<p>Brittany: (Irritated) That's what I said. I tell you, if I found Quinn
at my party, I'd hunt her down like an animal. (leaves)
<p>Sandi: You know, Tiffany, I suddenly sense the possibility for TDoQ.
<p>Tiffany: That is soooo... (pause) What?
<p>Sandi: "Total Destruction of Quinn"
<p>Tiffany: That is soooo wrong.
<p>Sandi: (Looks cross at Tiffany) Maybe it's wrong *now*. I suppose the
entertainment can wait a few hours. We don't want to ruin the party just
yet.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(Three girls are gathered. Daria is within hearing range)
<p>Girl1: That girl is more popular than her. But not as popular as Sandi.
<p>Girl2: Is Sandi as popular as Quinn?
<p>Girl1: Don't be silly. No one is as popular as Quinn.
<p>Girl3: Where is Quinn?
<p>Girl2: Over there. (points) She's dressed as G. I. Joe.
<p>Girl3: She's wearing a gas mask? Yuck.
<p>Girl1: Her popularity can handle it. If she hadn't been invited, that'd
be another matter.
<p>Girl2: What about *that* girl? (points at Daria) She's not popular at
all. But the guys are drooling over her.
<p>Girl1: What did you expect? She's dressed as Xena.
<p>(Daria gets a miserable look on her face)
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(Kevin walks over to Brittany)
<p>Kevin: Hi, babe.
<p>Brittany: Kevvie, what're you doing? You were supposed to come as Louis
the sixteenth.
<p>Kevin: Yeah. But then I saw this monkey costume. It's cool isn't it?
<p>Brittany: Uuuuuuh! You big ape.
<p>Kevin: That's right babe. I'm a big ape! (jumps up and down) Wuk, wuk,
wuk!
<p>Brittany: Aaaaah!
<p>(Brittany hits Kevin in the face. Kevin falls to the ground. Brittany
leans over him)
<p>Brittany: I'm sorry, Kevvie. I don't know what comes over me sometimes.
Kevvie, talk to me.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(Sandi looks at Quinn. She has a smile on her face. Quinn sees it and
shudders)
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Jane: If I'd known Kevin and Brittany were planning to come as Louis
the sixteenth and Marie Antoinette, I'd have dressed as Robespierre.
<p>Daria: And if I had know Kevin would come as a gorilla, I'd have...
No. I suppose it should have been obvious he would've come as a gorilla.
(sigh) I hate being here.
<p>Jane: What is it this time? Other than being surrounded by people you
don't like.
<p>Daria: And who think I'm Xena.
<p>Jane: You mean the guys finally like you?
<p>Daria: I could kill you for that. But I don't have my spear with me.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(The 3 J's walk over to Quinn. They're dressed as cavemen)
<p>Jamie: Hi, Quinn.
<p>Joey: We heard you were you, Quinn.
<p>Jeffy: It is you, Quinn? Isn't it?
<p>Quinn: (Removes her gas mask) It's me. You like my costume?
<p>Jamie: I love it. You look like one of my action figures.
<p>Joey: A real warrior woman.
<p>Jeffy: Hey, guys. Look over there. It's Xena! (points at Daria)
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(Daria is getting something to eat. The 3 J's surrounds her)
<p>Jamie: Can I get you something to eat?
<p>Joey: Can I get you something to drink?
<p>Jeffy: Can I eat and drink?
<p>Daria: Excuse me?
<p>Quinn: Guys, what're you doing? I'm the one you're supposed to do favors
for.
<p>Jamie: I know.
<p>Joey: But... I mean... look at her.
<p>Jeffy: She's dressed as Xena.
<p>Quinn: No, she's not ...
<p>Daria: Don't say it, Quinn.
<p>Quinn: ... She's dressed as Athena.
<p>Jamie: That's what we said. Xena.
<p>Daria: I told you not to say it.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(A few hours later. Sandi walks over to Brittany)
<p>Sandi: Hi. I just wanted to congratulate you with this great party.
<p>Brittany: Thanks. But it's not a great party. Kevvie can't see with
his left eye. And now Mack is angry at me because he might have to sit
out on the next game.
<p>Sandi: Still, a costume party was a good idea. Take Quinn. Doesn't she
look great as soldier?
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(Daria is standing by the window. A sound comes from behind the curtains)
<p>Quinn: Pssst.
<p>Daria: Oh, no. The curtains are talking to me. Why oh why didn't I take
the blue pill?
<p>Quinn: Daria, be serious.
<p>Daria: *I* should be serious? You're the one hiding behind a curtain.
<p>Quinn: I think Brittany is looking for me. Can't you see how she seems
to be searching for someone?
<p>(Daria looks at Brittany who is scouting around the room. Sandi is following
her around)
<p>Daria: Maybe she's looking for her lost marbles.
<p>Quinn: No, it's me. I think someone might have told her I'm here.
<p>Daria: Someone?
<p>Quinn: Fine. Sandi must have told her. Daria, you have to help me.
<p>Daria: Again? This is becoming a habit.
<p>Quinn: Please. You don't want me to get mutilated, do you?
<p>Daria: Damn. Move over. (gets behind the curtain) Now strip.
<p>Quinn: Oh, I see. Smart.
<p>Daria: You do realize that if anyone pulls the curtains aside and sees
the two of us standing in our underwear, it'll be your popularity and not
mine, as I don't have one.
<p>Quinn: Don't be silly. If anyone sees the curtains move they'll just
think someone is making out. Anyhow, thanks for caring.
<p>Daria: But I don't. I'm only doing this because I'm tired of people
thinking I'm Xena.
<p>Quinn: (Voiceover) She cares.
<p>Daria: (Voiceover) She thinks I care.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(Brittany walks over to the one dressed as soldier and grabs her arm)
<p>Brittany: Got you, Quinn. I'm going to show you what I do with gate
crashers.
<p>Daria: Brittany, it's me, Daria. (takes her gas mask of)
<p>Brittany: Daria? But Sandi told me the girl dressed as soldier was
Quinn. Why would she do such a thing?
<p>Daria: Sounds to me like she's trying to make fun of you.
<p>Brittany: (To Sandi, angry) So *that's* it! You're trying to make fun
of me. You fashion girls are all the same. First Quinn destroys my crystal
bullhorn and now this. But you just wait, Sandi Griffin. You've no idea
what I'm going to do to you now.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(A few moments later. Brittany's guests are standing by the windows
looking out at the garden where a screaming Sandi is being chased around
by Brittany)
<p>Jane: You think she'll catch her?
<p>Daria: It's possible. Although Brittany's eighteenth century dress does
give Sandi an advantage.
<p>Girl1: What I don't understand is why Brittany invited Quinn if she's
got a grudge against her.
<p>Jane: She had to. I mean, what would a party be without Quinn?
<p>Girl1: Yeah, that must be why.
<p>Daria: Excuse me.
<p>Jane: I don't know. Maybe all your being nice to Quinn is starting to
rub off.
<p>Daria: (Sigh) That's just it, isn't it? I'm doing all this because I
want to be nice to Quinn.
<p>Jane: Don't be silly. You had other reasons. Helen is making you do
this. Remember?
<p>Daria: I know you mean well. But there's no point to it. First I fail
to make fun of Quinn. Then I save her popularity. And now I've saved her
from certain mutilation by Brittany. Let's face it. This isn't just me
getting older, it's me getting soft. I've lost my self. I might as well
go home and borrow some of Quinn's clothes. Maybe get some new glasses,
and a new hair style.
<p>Jane: (Pause) Help me carry the leftover food into the Tank. Then I'll
drive you home so you can sleep on it. You'll see. Tomorrow you'll be your
old hard self.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(Morgendorffer livingroom. Jake is watching the news. Daria, looking
miserable, comes in)
<p>Jake: Hi, kiddo. Uhm. Isn't that Quinn's costume you're wearing?
<p>Daria: We decided to make a switch. It's part of the new me.
<p>Jake: Was it a good party?
<p>Daria: As good as can be expected when you haven't got anything in common
with the other guests I suppose. It did get fun near the end though. Unfortunately,
Brittany's dress prevented her from scaling the fence. (sits next to Jake)
<p>Jake: (Confused) The fence? Is that sarcasm?
<p>Daria: No, it's a teenage thing, dad. Don't try to understand it.
<p>TV: An officer at the scene said that if she hadn't died in her own
apartment, she might never have been identified, as her face was gone.
<p>Jake: Isn't it disgusting how something like that can happen in this
day and age? A woman dies in her apartment, no one notices, and her cats
starts eating her.
<p>Daria: You have to look at it in a positive way, dad. At least her cats
didn't starve.
<p>Jake: (Pause) Daria, I think we need to have a little father to daughter
talk.
<p>Daria: There's no such thing.
<p>Jake: I suppose I could arrange for a mother to daughter talk instead.
<p>Daria: (Voiceover) It seems like dad has one of his clarity periods.
Better to play along. (outloud) Father to daughter is fine.
<p>Jake: What I want to say is that I've noticed you often say cruel and
heartless things, Daria. Like other people's sufferings are somehow amusing
to you. Helen has assured me that you're just being sarcastic. But to tell
you the truth I often doubt that.
<p>Daria: (Voiceover) Be careful here. (outloud) I'm just being sarcastic.
<p>Jake: Are you sure? Sometimes you do come across as both cold and cruel.
<p>Daria: (Smiles) You really mean that? So you don't think I've gone soft?
<p>Jake: You, soft? No. You're harder than my clients. And this is what
I want to talk ...
<p>Daria: (Hugs Jake) Thanks, dad. (voiceover) What am I doing?
<p>Jake: (Puts his arms around Daria) My little girl. I didn't mean to
get you upset. I'm sure you were just being sarcastic those times. You're
not cold or cruel. You're my little soft kiddo. (pads Daria on the head)
<p>Daria: (Flatly) You have no idea what this means to me.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(Daria's room. There's a knock on the door)
<p>Daria: (From under the bed) Go away.
<p>(Quinn comes in)
<p>Quinn: Daria?
<p>Daria: What part of the "go away" didn't you understand?
<p>Quinn: What're you doing under the bed?
<p>Daria: Searching for my lost self.
<p>Quinn: Aren't you supposed to become a hermit to do that? Not that I
like hermits. I've seen pictures of hermits and they dress really terrible.
Plus I think you have to be a man to be a hermit.
<p>Daria: Whatever. What do you want?
<p>Quinn: Mom was waiting for me when I came home. She told me I owe you
this big favor, and then she threatened to revoke my credit card privileges
if I didn't make it up to you. Not that she needed to. I'll gladly do you
a favor.
<p>Daria: (Surprised) You will?
<p>Quinn: Oh yes. I've dreamt of giving you a makeover my whole life.
<p>Daria: (Pause) Thanks, Quinn.
<p>Quinn: There's no need to thank me. Tomorrow we go shopping for some
new clothes for you.
<p>Daria: No, thank you for helping me find my lost self.
<p>Quinn: Daria, you know I don't understand what you say when you go all
brainy on me.
<p>Daria: Oh, you will.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(Next day. Jane's room. Jane and Daria are cleaning it. Quinn comes
in. She's holding a broom in her hands)
<p>Daria: The costume party was yesterday you know.
<p>Quinn: What's that sup... Oh, ha, ha. Very funny. Look, this isn't fair.
<p>Jane: It's not meant to be.
<p>Quinn: It's bad enough you make me help clean Jane's house. But all
you and Jane do is clean her room. And that Trent thing won't even wake
up. You can't make me clean the rest of the house by myself.
<p>Daria: I can, I will, and I do. Four words, Quinn. "Denial of credit
card".
<p>Quinn: Uuuuh! (leaves)
<p>Jane: Now that I don't have to call an industrial cleaning service,
and I have all the food from Brittany's party, what am I going to do with
the extra money?
<p>Daria: Take me to a UFO convention.
<p>Jane: We've done that before.
<p>Daria: I know, but Brittany's party has given me inspiration. Maybe
this time we should wear costumes.
<p>Jane: You mean aliens? That's lame.
<p>Daria: No. I'm thinking something in black. And sunglasses. Maybe find
Artie and stalk him.
<p>Jane: WiB? Now *I* feel like adopting you.
<p>(Quinn's screams are heard)
<p>Quinn: AAAAAH! IT MOVED, IT MOVED!!
<p>Daria: You have a pet?
<p>Jane: That or one of Trent's socks.
<p>Daria: I could help her, but why would I? I guess Quinn-torment is still
a part of my life. Maybe I haven't gone soft.
<p>Jane: You haven't gone soft. (voiceover) She's not getting soft.
<p>Daria: (Voiceover) She doesn't think I'm getting soft.
