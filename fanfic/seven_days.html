<p class=MsoNormal>Jane marched into Wind's vacated room, armed only with an
empty trash bag and a sense of mission.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The room was in the usual disheveled, filthy state in which Wind usually
left it, with candy bar wrappers and food scraps left everywhere, scattered
like the place had been ransacked by a hungry ten-year-old.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Wind</i><span style='font-style:
normal'>, she mentally addressed her absent sibling as she tossed the refuse
into the plastic bag, </span><i>are you incapable of doing anything for yourself,
other than mooching off us and screwing up relationships?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't ask much out of a living space,
but I draw the line at attracting rats and mice.</i><span style='font-style:
normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She couldn't abide the
vermin; they nibbled on her paintings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Which is why, every time Wind departed after one of his unannounced
visits, she found herself playing maid, scouring his room for every last bread
crust and empty soft drink can he had left behind, leaving nothing that might
attract art-destroying rodents.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wind had been visiting for the past two days, and had just
up and left the night before (a circumstance Jane welcomed, despite the extra
work it brought her).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It had been
an odd visit, though; he hadn't shown up crying, so he wasn't on the outs with
his girlfriend <i>du jour</i><span style='font-style:normal'>, and he hadn't asked
for money.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, he had holed
up in his room, barely making his way outside those four walls.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And then, he had just left, with no
more explanation given than when he had arrived.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He hadn't even spent any time inside the new "naming
gazebo".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All of which just made
the usual littered state of his room even worse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Having picked up every visible scrap of food, Jane gave the
room a final once over, and noticed something she had missed, or ignored, the
first time around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lying on Wind's
bed was a plain, unmarked videotape.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She picked it up and examined it from all sides, but there was nothing
to give a clue as to its origins or contents.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><i>I guess Wind forgot it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>There's something intriguing about unmarked tapes, but it's
probably just one of those marriage counseling TV shows he's so addicted
to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Or maybe it's something a
little more . . . private.</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Did Wind make videos like that?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane didn't know whether to be
titillated or disgusted with the possibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>Well, I have to watch it now, just to find
out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If it's one of </i><span
style='font-style:normal'>those</span><i>, I'll turn it off right away.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Normally, the TV in this room didn't have a VCR, but Jane
noticed that there was one hooked up now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Looking closer, she realized that it was the set from the living room
television.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Wind must have
brought it up here to watch the tape in private; maybe it really is him and
some girl . . . ew.</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane stuck out her tongue at the
thought, but was still curious enough to try it out.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She slid the tape into the deck, and pressed play . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria was sitting at her computer, searching for a starting
point for her new Melody Powers story, when Jane burst into her room, waving a
videotape over her head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yo, <i>amiga</i><span style='font-style:normal'>, you've
gotta see this!" she exclaimed as she walked over to Daria's television.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria herself was surprised by her
friend's enthusiasm; of the two of them, Daria was much more the film
buff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Before Tom had provided a
new viewing companion, Jane had accompanied her to a few arthouse screenings,
but had never shown more than cursory interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane's taste in film ran more towards the exploding head
variety, which Daria found amusing only in small doses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What is it?" she asked somewhat cautiously as she walked
over to her bed and sat down at her usual TV-viewing position.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm not really sure," Jane replied, somewhat distracted by
getting the tape into the built-in VCR.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria cocked an eyebrow in curiosity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So you've decided to start showing me random videotapes?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I found it in Wind's room this morning, while I was cleaning
up after him," Jane said, now paying fuller attention, having gotten the tape
in and activated the unit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
took the remote and joined Daria on the bed.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Her voice betrayed none of her usual irritation at having to
pick up after her older brother.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"It's
this weird collection of images, very surreal.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Very creepy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I'm not sure what it all means."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"And you think I should see this why, exactly?"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not that Daria wasn't up for the
surreal and creepy, but if it had been found in Wind's possession she doubted
that there could be anything particularly special about it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Because I haven't been able to get the images out of my
head all day; it's given me all sorts of great sketches."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She pulled one of her pocket-sized
sketchbooks out of her jacket and waved it in Daria's face, then flipped very
rapidly through it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria wasn't
able to catch a good glimpse of the contents, but it appeared nearly full.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I can't remember the last time I've
produced so much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So I thought you
might appreciate the inspiration; besides, I want to see what you make of it
all."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria couldn't deny her
friend's enthusiasm, and seeing as how her own inspiration seemed elusive at
present, she gave Jane the affirmative.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Jane started the tape.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the images flashed by, Daria found herself transfixed,
unable to turn away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The images
made no sense, but somehow they were compelling, entrancing, disturbing, and by
the time it was over, Daria was annoyed to find herself fighting down an
extreme sense of unease, as though she had just woken from a nightmare.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was even breathing a bit heavily,
and she wondered if she had been holding her breath without noticing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So, what do you think?" Jane asked, ejecting the tape and
slipping it into her jacket pocket.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She was eager to hear her friend's considered opinion, but Daria didn't
know what to say.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She wanted to
shrug it off with a joke, some sarcastic comment that would trivialize the
strange effect it had had on her, but she found she couldn't dismiss it that
easily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, downstairs, the
phone rang; the sound was faint, and only occurred once, but it was enough of
an outside stimulus to bring her out of the hold the tape had put on her.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane was grinning sadistically.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It had that effect on me, too, when I first watched it,"
she said, "but after an hour or so I started to get all sorts of great
ideas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm thinking of doing a
whole series of paintings inspired by it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"We should send it in to <i>Sick, Sad World</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>," Daria said, finally finding her voice.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"They would love to get their hands on
something this bizarre."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah, I thought about it," Jane replied, "but since I don't
know who created it, there would probably be some copywrite issue."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Wind didn't say anything about it?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Nope."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane
shook her head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"He didn't breathe
a word.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I just found it in his
room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe he's trying his hand
at filmmaking, or has a friend who is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But speaking of <i>Sick, Sad World</i><span style='font-style:normal'> .
. ."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She flipped the channel, and
familiar lone eye filled the screen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Its familiarity helped to soothe Daria's nerves, and soon things were
back to normal again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The only
sign that the tape had ever existed was that, every few minutes, Jane would
pick up her sketchbook and draw a few quick lines, then return it to her
pocket.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria was curious to see
what she had come up with, but the images of the tape were too fresh in her
mind for her to want to see, at this very moment, what Jane's mind had done
with them; she could take a look later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>About an hour later, Helen called Daria to dinner, and Jane
stood up to leave.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Are you sure you want to go?" Daria asked.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"We've got all the lasagna you can
eat."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I think I'll pass.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I'd rather spend my time working on these new paintings than playing
Twenty Questions with your parents."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria accompanied her down the stairs, and as Jane exited the door, she
turned towards the kitchen, and walked in just as her mother was removing the
lasagna from the oven.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was the
first one there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, please tell your friends that I don't appreciate
practical jokes, especially when I'm waiting for a call from Eric," Helen said,
dropping the pasta onto the table, her voice stern.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'll be sure to pass that on to my hoard of
practical-joke-playing companions," Daria replied.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She smirked at Helen's baleful stare.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Seriously, Daria," she admonished, "I was waiting for a
very important call about an hour ago, but when the phone rang, it was some
girl.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She just said 'seven days',
and then hung up."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane was in my room an hour ago, and that's not her style
anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What did she sound like?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Young," Helen said, as if just realizing it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"She had a very high voice."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It was probably one of Quinn's fashion fiends; sounds like
Stacy."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Though from what she knew
of the pig-tailed sycophant, that sort of joke wasn't really her style
either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Or maybe just a wrong
number."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Maybe," Helen conceded, just as Jake and Quinn entered the
room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria didn't give the incident a second thought.</p>

<h1>Tuesday</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria sat on Jane's bed, pen scratching rapidly across the
paper in her notebook, ideas flooding her mind.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She had woken up that morning feeling disturbed, off-kilter,
though she couldn't put her finger on exactly why; she couldn't remember any
bad dreams, which were the usual cause of such morning jitters.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The mood had lasted throughout
breakfast, and it hadn't mixed well with Quinn's dissertation on the pros and
cons of short hairstyles for hot summer months.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She had told Quinn that if she wanted a truly striking look
for summer, than she should go for the cool bald look, giving her admirers the
chance to compliment her on her shapely skull, adding that maybe shorter hair
would not sap so much energy from her brain.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Quinn had replied that only weird artsy girls still thought
that the bald look was in, that she had already been the recipient of several
approving comments on the symmetrical shape of her head, and had finished with
the suggestion that she and her weird artsy friend should sit in on a gathering
of the former Fashion Club to find out what would be fashionable for artsy
types in the next season.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To the
dismay of both their parents, the conversation had just gone downhill from
there, and by the end of the meal Daria knew that she was going to have to
spend the rest of the day not just isolated in her room, but totally out of the
house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria had felt a twinge of
guilt over slipping into her older patterns with Quinn, when they were finally
starting to find some common ground, but by the time she was halfway to Jane's,
any residual remorse was crowded right out of her head by a flood of ideas for
her new Melody Powers story, all of which took their inspiration from one of
the images from the tape Jane had brought her yesterday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Which is where she found herself now, writing furiously to
try to capture all the nuances and details she saw in her head before they
slipped away into the ether.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With
an unoccupied corner of her mind, she wondered why the disjointed and enigmatic
scenes from the video could be so strongly suggestive, how they could form a
narrative in her mind almost of their own volition, with what felt like very
little shaping on her part.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
while she was curious, she would not argue with such instant inspiration; one
of the first things that any writer learned was to capture such momentary
flashes as quickly as possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She was not the only one so in the grip of her muse; Jane
was painting furiously, barely finishing one image before tossing it aside and
starting on another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pictures of
ladders, wells, twisted and leafless trees, dead horses.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And on every canvas, somewhere, out in
front or hidden in the background, a ring, a slightly uneven but unbroken
circle of paint.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All of them drawn
in a curious angular style, quite unlike Jane's former works; in subdued colors
and black and grey, in contrast to her accustomed colorful approach.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If Daria had not been sitting in the
same room, watching her in the throes of creation, she would have been willing
to swear that these were the work of another artist completely.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>But isn't that what every artist wants
to do, to progress, to never produce the same work twice?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If Jane is using the tape as the means
to that end, then all the better for her.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They had spent most of the day in silence, appreciating each
other's company without feeling the need to interrupt the creative process; but
after several hours the rush began to wear off, or at least to recede
temporarily like a tide, and conversation began to leak out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So, any news yet on the Boston housing front?" Jane
inquired as she ran her brush along the canvas.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The very thought of that situation was enough to make Daria
flop onto her back, hanging her head off the end of the bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's a nightmare," she said after a few seconds of inward
groaning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Real estate in Boston
is a buyer's nightmare, rent is sky high, and Raft has no single-bedroom
dorms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even with my scholarships,
I'm not going to be able to afford an apartment all to myself until you
arrive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mom was right; I am going
to end up with a psycho roommate."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Just watch out for the showers," Jane said, head still
pointed towards the easel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's what I get for being optimistic," Daria groaned.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I was counting on college being the
start of my exit from the purgatory of high school into the beginnings of my
real life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An environment where I
am surrounded by people chosen for their intelligence instead of their physical
proximity."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Without actually having to live in contact with any of
them."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'd like to be able to ease into the experience, yes."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She sat back up and watched as Jane
continued to apply color to canvas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"High school isn't real life at all; it's not even preparation for
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I just don't want any
additional problems to deal with as I make the transition."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I told you before, I can do some work for Gary's Gallery,
send you my half of the rent."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria frowned, wishing she could say yes to the offer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I can't do that to you, Jane," she said.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"You can't afford artist burnout right
before you head off to BFAC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've
shared a house with Quinn for seventeen years; I can share a room with an
unknown irritant for four months."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Maybe I can sell some of these at Gary's," Jane mused as
she put the final touch on her newest piece, then replaced the filled canvas
with a blank one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She considered
for only a few seconds before starting up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, nothing says artistic sophistication in the suburbs
like a painting of a dead horse."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's a comment on the death of nature in modern society,"
Jane said, even as she sketched the outline of spreading branches.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"It's environmentally conscious art,
perfect for the walls of SUV owners and hairspray addicts."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Just the thing to hang on the wall next to the mounted deer
head."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, Daria knew what
had to happen next to Melody Powers, and her pen was moving again.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She would have to transfer all of this
to her computer later, which is where she usually did her writing, but it was
critical to capture the ideas as they came and not censor herself merely to
shorten that future repetitive task.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The room faded back into silence.</p>

<h1>Wednesday</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It took several of Daria's insistent rings of the bell
before Jane finally opened the door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Despite the early hour (early for Jane, anyway), there was little of her
usual morning dishevelment about her -- she was wearing her usual daytime
clothes, her hair was combed, and her movements didn't drag with morning
fatigue; however, there were large dark circles under her eyes, and her face
was pale, giving her a completely different morning zombie appearance.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria knew that she herself couldn't be
looking all that good; she had ran all the way from her house, or at least
walked very fast, and she was panting heavily and feeling a little sick to her
stomach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course, the nausea had
more than one cause.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As she stepped through the doorway, she wordlessly handed Jane
several sheets of paper; it was the computer printout of her latest Melody
Powers work, the one she had so meticulously typed into her word processor from
her handwritten text of the day before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Except that when she had woken up this morning and opened the program to
do a little more work, she found that that was not what she had written at
all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Filling the pages was a
simple three-word phrase, repeated over and over again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Everyone will suffer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Writing your manifesto?" Jane asked as she flipped through
the pages, each one identical to the last.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That is what I found this morning in the Melody Powers
folder on my computer," Daria said, finding her voice, though the words were
still forced out between panted breaths.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She hadn't appreciated just how much gym class had kept her in shape,
hated though it was; two months without it, and her chest was on fire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Could it just be somebody's prank?"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane's voice was choked; her face paled
yet another shade, and she bit down on her bottom lip.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria shook her head, wishing that
things were that simple.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I keep my work password-protected," she said, the shortness
of breath receding, though the roiling of her stomach continued strong.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Hacking it would be way out of Quinn's
league, and writing about suffering would rank a bit too high on her 'ew' meter
anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't think that I've
pissed off any computer geeks lately."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She started to pace around Jane, who stood still at the center, perusing
the papers with rising alarm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"If
this is what was in my story file, it's because <i>I</i><span style='font-style:
normal'> put it there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But either
I didn't realize I was doing it, or I don't remember it."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She stood still, facing Jane once
again, though she tried not to concentrate on the papers her friend clutched in
her hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I wonder when I'm going
to start chasing Quinn with an axe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Or a crimping iron."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria," Jane finally said, a tremor in her voice, "there's
something I think you need to see."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane's room was littered with paintings, tossed about the
room in careless fashion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But the
first thing Daria noticed was the easel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>On it was a white canvas, its purity violated by a single image -- a
black ring, painted over and over again until the paint was visibly piled up,
with the paintbrush embedded in the center.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It looked to Daria as though Jane had just run the brush
around and around until she had finally run the brush right through the canvas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"This morning, I tried to go back to my old projects," Jane
said from behind her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I
couldn't.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No matter what I tried
to draw or paint, it always came out something from the tape; at first, I
didn't even realize I was doing it, and when I did, I couldn't stop.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was like my hands didn't even belong
to me anymore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria, look at
these paintings!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She stepped into
Daria's line of sight and waved her arm to take in the entire room and all the
images contained therein.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Do
these even look like my work?!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How
could I have ever thought that I was the one doing this?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And that's not even the worst of
it."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She pointed to a stack of canvases
in one corner of the room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria
walked over to look, and found that they were all her old works, piled
chaotically.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But every face in
every picture was painted over, not neatly, but as though a child had taken the
brush and scribbled furiously, obliterating all traces of identity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I did all that after I finished the new pictures," Jane was
saying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"It was like I just went
insane.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It didn't wear off until I
had defaced every single one."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At
the last few words, her voice sank to a husky whisper.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm sorry, Jane," Daria said, not knowing what else to say
to comfort her friend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But Jane's
loss was not the only question at issue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"That tape did something to both of us.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Some kind of hypnotic suggestion, or mind control."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Have you been getting visits from those black helicopters
again?" Jane asked, giving her friend a skeptical glance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, just the usual flying saucers."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria paused, wishing they could just
trade clever retorts and ignore the unnerving events behind them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But her unerring sense of reality
brought her back to face them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I
know that I sound like Artie on one of his stranger days, but I can't think of
anything else that makes sense."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't know, Daria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I don't feel all that 'controlled'."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane clamped down suddenly after her last word, and Daria
knew she had something more to say.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane, what are you thinking?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You won't want to hear it."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane smirked grimly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Good; I haven't heard anything I didn't want to hear in at
least a few minutes."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane sighed, and visibly braced herself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I feel like I'm being haunted, like some <i>thing</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> is looking over my shoulder, guiding my hand," she
said haltingly, converting her sensations into words even as she said
them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I know, it sounds
ridiculous, and you don't believe in things like that.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, when I was really young, my
parents had some friends who were into some really weird mystical stuff, like
ouiji boards and s&eacute;ances and things like that, and I saw things that you would
never believe in."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"And when I was four," Daria replied, "I was convinced that
there were monsters waiting in my closet to get me at night; there were even
times when I was sure that I saw them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But I outgrew it; kids with active imaginations see a lot of things that
aren't there."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane shook her head
emphatically.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"This wasn't like seeing a few shadows and hanging shirts in
your closet at night," she said, knowing that her friend would never believe
her, knowing what she had seen, knowing the sensation of the presence she now
felt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"There was no way these
could have been anything but spirits, ghosts, demons.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm not saying that I'm certain that's what's happening now,
but it feels pretty damn familiar."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria knew that this kind of discussion could go on for
hours, with neither of them making headway against the other's basic worldview;
normally, she would have welcomed the game, but there were more important
things right now than fun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Wind has to know something about this," she said.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"What the tape means; what it's doing
to us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Who he got the tape from,
if nothing else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Can you call him
and ask?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I already tried, earlier today," Jane replied,
frustrated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I couldn't get a hold
of him; he probably didn't pay his cell phone bill.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We'll have to go see him in person.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His houseboat is usually moored in
Baltimore harbor; I've been there a couple of times, so I'm pretty sure I can
find it again."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We'll

<p class=MsoNormal>About two hours later, they were standing at a pier in
Baltimore harbor, Wind's somewhat-decrepit houseboat floating in the water
before them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At their backs was
the bustle of the activities of seafarers and dockworkers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria wasn't a huge fan of crowds, but
she could usually tolerate them; today, however, she couldn't shake the
impression that someone was staring down her neck, raising the short hairs with
a prickle up and down her spine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It had to be nerves, and she told herself that the day had given her
every reason to feel out of sorts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She just wanted to get in, get the information they needed from Wind,
and get out of the city as quickly as possible, back to the solitude and safety
of her own room, or Jane's.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Wind is the Lane-est of the Lanes," Jane said, surveying
the floating domicile with amusement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Even his house is made to move around."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"And yet he keeps tying himself down with wives," Daria
replied, which seemed to her to be the most un-Lane-like characteristic of
all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Vincent and Amanda Lane's
absentee relationship, from each other as much as from their children, was
proof of that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>But at least
they've managed to stay married, in name at least.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, he never was able to get life completely right," Jane
said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She stepped onto the boat
and rapped on the door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So, who is he with right now?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Haven't kept up; it's time to open the wrapper and unveil
the surprise."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no answer
to her knock, so she tried again, louder and more insistent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Can I just keep the Cracker-Jacks instead?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As they waited for an answer to their overture, Daria looked
down into the water flowing before her feet.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The play of light in the depths, blue and violet flashes
flowing and melding, was fascinating, and she felt the mysteries of the deep
beckoning to her, calling to her to plunge into their depths, to be submerged
in the all-encompassing embrace of deep water.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She felt a rush, and suddenly the water surrounded her; she
was floating in an unknowable expanse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But it wasn't the warm, loving experience that had been promised -- she
felt oppressed, entrapped, as the water quickly changed from blue to black and
an ocean of darkness closed in around her.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Lost and abandoned, she opened her mouth to scream . . .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"DARIA!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The world of light and air snapped back into place, and
Daria found herself once more standing on the pier next to Wind's houseboat,
both her arms firmly grasped in Jane's hands, her frightened expression only a
few inches from Daria's own.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, what happened? " Jane asked with slowly-receding
panic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I saw you about ready to
fall into the water, and when I tried to stop you, you didn't answer.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Are you okay?"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria had to take a few deep breaths
before she felt she had the strength to answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I thought that I <i>had</i><span style='font-style:normal'>
fallen in."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was still had to
believe that she had not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"It
seemed so real, not like a daydream at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I thought I was going to die in black water."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The last statement didn't seem to allay
Jane's worry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Jane, if I was going
to commit suicide, I wouldn't do it by drowning; it's too clean.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I want to leave a more memorable
corpse."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria stepped back,
removing herself from her friend's concerned grip; she could stand on her own
now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I think we've just
discovered another side effect of the tape."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane swallowed nervously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"We're not going to be getting information on that," she
said, "at least not right away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>While you were contemplating life as a mermaid, I had a very quick chat
with the lady of the house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Looks
like Wind's been kicked out again, just yesterday."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Shouldn't that make it easier?" Daria responded.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Won't he just show up at your place in
tears?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane shook her head in
unfortunate denial.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"He only does that when he's been kicked out and had no
money to go anywhere else; he would have turned up yesterday if that had been
the case."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She sighed, knowing
that the road ahead had just lengthened considerably.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"When he does make it out with some cash, he usually ends up
in a bar, or lying in an alley somewhere, drunk out of his mind.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And he can do it for days on end.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Right now, he's almost certainly having
a few drinks somewhere in Baltimore."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"We'll have to search for him," Daria said.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Normally, the idea of looking for a
drunken Wind Lane, or for a sober one, would have never entered her list of
priorities, but Daria didn't know how many of these ever-more-disturbing side
effects she could take before snapping completely, or falling into the ocean
and drowning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And since Quinn (or
Brittany or Mr. O'Neill or another suitable victim) would not be around to take
the brunt of her psychosis after her brain did snap, she thought that was an
outcome that should probably be avoided.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Unless we're very lucky, we probably won't find him in an afternoon,
and it's too far to commute to and from Lawndale every day, so we need to get a
hotel room in town.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I think I've
got enough saved in my Montana Cabin Fund to keep us out of the roach motels,
for a few days at least."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"We might not have longer than a few days anyway," Jane
said, a disturbing scenario piecing itself together in her mind.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Right after I watched the tape, I got
a phone call; it was a little girl, and all she said was 'seven days'.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I thought it was just a wrong number,
but now . . ."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria felt her face go white, and a chill spread through her
chest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"We got the same call," she said, voice carefully
level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Mom picked it up, and
thought it was a joke.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But it
would have come about the time we were watching the tape."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Then it would probably be a very good idea to find out
what's going on before that time is up," Jane said, mentally calculating the
time left in her head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"A little
less than five days, if she's punctual.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Or <i>it</i><span style='font-style:normal'>."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane, there is no <i>it</i><span style='font-style:normal'>,"
Daria said, determined not to fall prey to superstition, even though it seemed
to have overtaken her best friend, normally the most rational person she knew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What else could it be?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>How could any normal person know exactly when we watched the
tape?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't know," Daria admitted, "but that doesn't mean there
isn't a way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane, even if ghosts
and goblins existed, I don't think they would be able to use the telephone, or
even want to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Why not just appear
in person, since they can go anywhere they want?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Because it's scarier this way, when we don't know what's
happening."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I think the automatic writing and the visions are scary
enough, thank you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't need
any extra mystery to add to the terror."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria realized that they were once again falling into a fruitless and
distracting discussion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Either
way, I think we can both agree that we need to find Wind before this 'seven
days' is up, so we can't afford to lose any time. <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>If we head back to Lawndale now to pack, we can have a hotel
room in the city before too late tonight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I'll just tell my parents I'm staying a few days with you; they'll be
glad to have the house to themselves."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria never thought too hard about exactly why her parents enjoyed their
solitude.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Right," Jane said as they walked back to the car.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Two women, one car, one mission on the
road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Partners in crime!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria tossed a few pairs of clean socks into her tiny
suitcase, which was already nearly filled.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She felt the need to pack lightly and quickly; no reason to
give Helen or Jake a chance to change their minds about their daughter's week
at Jane's (though there was no reason that they should), and she wanted to get
back to the city while there was still time to find a decent vacant hotel
room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No doubt, at her place, Jane
was doing the same thing, while trying to drill into Trent's laconic skull
their instructions to let them know immediately if Wind should show up.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course, that was no guarantee of
anything; Trent could sleep through Wind's arrival, or intend to call and
decide to take a nap first.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
that didn't even include the possibility of Mystik Spiral having a gig someplace
that would keep them away for a while.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Still, he was the only watchdog they had.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But Daria didn't think he would be that necessary anyway; no
doubt Jane was right, and if Wind was going to show up, he would have done so
already.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria closed her suitcase, and, pressing down hard on the
locks, managed to snap it shut, just in time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, have you seen . . ." Quinn asked as she walked
briskly through the door, then stopped cold.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"Daria, where are you going?"<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Her eyes narrowed dangerously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"To Jane's," Daria replied, as naturally as if it was the
unvarnished truth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"You were
standing right there when I told Mom and Dad."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You never pack when you go to Jane's," Quinn replied,
sibling detective mode on in full force.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"You keep a toothbrush there already, and several selections from your .

going?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Damn, when did Quinn get so perceptive?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't have time for this; I'll have
to settle it the old-fashioned way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"How much?" she asked, business-like but bitter.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quinn didn't immediately answer;
instead, she looked slowly around, scoping out her environs.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She smiled, and Daria was suddenly very
worried.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I want your room," Quinn declared, as though it were the
most reasonable request in the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"After you go off to college, I mean.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I think it has real potential, once I take down the padding
from the walls and remove the bars from the windows and replace that door with
the awful poetry and . . ."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Quinn," Daria broke in, trying to nip this in the bud
before her sister really got started, "I'll still need this room over the
summer; you can't have it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria," Quinn replied, sounding as though she was reasoning
with a person who was somewhat slow-witted, "do you really plan to move back
here for the summer?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Could you
enjoy Lawndale after living in Boston?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>I don't enjoy it now</i><span style='font-style:normal'>,
Daria thought, but her sister had a point.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Living within these four walls again, after having enjoyed
relative freedom, would be unbearable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'll even give you an extra incentive," Quinn offered
magnanimously.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"In addition to not
telling Mom or Dad what you are planning, I'll even provide a distraction so
you can make it out the door without them seeing you or your suitcase.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Deal?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Deal," Daria said, deciding that she had most of the summer
to win or bargain her room back into her possession.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"I'm leaving now, so if you could provide your distraction,
it would be most helpful."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn nodded, and headed out the door.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A few seconds later, Daria heard her
sister tell their parents something about her new older boyfriend who was
coming by to pick her up on his motorcycle.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Taking her advantage, Daria slipped out of her room, down
the stairs, and out the front door without so much as a sideways glance from
either of her parents (though she thought she caught a quick wink from
Quinn).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, she was off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since it had taken most of the night to find a decent hotel
room, they started their search for Wind bright and early the next day; at
least, they had intended to start bright and early, though fatigue kept them
under the covers for most of the morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Even with the ample sleep, Daria still did not feel rested; her
sensation of being watched had not waned, and during the night she had had to
continually resist the urge to flip over in bed and check if someone was
standing behind her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Though she
had been terrified to see who it might be.<span style="mso-spacerun:

absurd, but the desire to glance over her shoulder remained.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The only experience that Daria had with police stations was
from the incident with Mystik Spiral, out in the middle of nowhere, and she
found the central police headquarters of Baltimore -- their first stop --
slightly different.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
cleaner, for one thing, and the various officers and employees went about their
jobs with what looked to bear some resemblance to competency.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, the place still felt
oppressive, badly lit and close.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The man sitting at the front desk barely looked up as they approached.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"We're looking for my brother Wind . . ." Jane started.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You can fill out a missing persons report after forty-eight
hours," he interrupted in a bored, distracted monotone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, it's not like that," Jane replied.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"You might have brought him in for
being drunk or disorderly or passed out in the street.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Have your guys arrested a Wind Lane in
the past two days?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The officer
sighed and typed at his computer a few moments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"We don't have anyone named 'Wind'," he said, putting a
particularly derisive emphasis on the name.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"Not here, or anywhere else in the city."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What about John Does?" Daria asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What does he look like?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane opened her mouth to give a description, then visibly
changed gears.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Get me a pencil and some paper," she said, her voice
excited, "and I'll sketch him for you."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria was shocked; she had been nervous at the idea of even picking up a
pencil since the incident the morning before, not wanting to see what she might
produce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane, are you sure you want to do this?" she asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I've got to try," Jane replied, determined.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I'm not just going to give in to this;
maybe if I really concentrate, I can control it."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She gripped the provided pen so tightly that her knuckles
paled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The phone at the desk rang,
and the officer answered, leaving the two of them ignored once again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane started in on her work, and it seemed to be going
well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Wind's features quickly took
shape under her hand, with his vapid stare and lost expression, and soon she
had completed a convincing likeness, formed from just a few lines of ink.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, as evenly and calmly as though it
was merely her finishing touch, she ran the point up and down over the face,
until no features could be seen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane!" Daria said sharply, and Jane jerked her pen up from
the paper with a tiny cry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Damn!" Jane exclaimed.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"I thought I was doing so well, too."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She crumpled up the paper with a
frustrated clench of her fist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"I'm not going to lose my art to this thing; I'll try again later."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She looked up, to make an oath to the
sky above her, and stopped dead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Or maybe it's not just me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria, look at that."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
pointed to the security monitor attached to the top of the wall across the
room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria looked to see the
image of the two of them standing at the desk; at least, she saw two figures
standing at the desk, wearing their clothes, but it was impossible to tell that
it was the two of them -- their faces were smeared, distorted, as though viewed
through extremely flawed glass.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria waved her hand in front of her face; the image wavered like water,
and snapped back into place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"How courteous," Daria said.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"Identity screened to protect the innocent."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No one else here looks like that," Jane said.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was right; several other people
were visible in the screen, and they were all normal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No one else here is innocent."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It was weird, to be sure, but to Daria's relief, this was
the most benign symptom of the tape they had yet seen.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria wondered when she had reached the
point when she could shrug off as minor an event this bizarre.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Still, at least it was just the two of
them in the picture; the way she had been feeling, she would not have been all
that surprised (horrified, but not surprised) to see a shadowy third figure
behind them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Damn, it sneaks up
on you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't believe in ghosts.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There's no such thing as
hauntings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I sound like the
scarecrow.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The officer hung up the phone, and turned back to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well?" he said impatiently.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"Is the sketch ready?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I . . . um . . . don't think I can do him justice," Jane
said, recovering quickly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I can
describe him, though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He's about
five foot ten, with brown eyes and shoulder-length blonde hair.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not very muscular.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't know what he would be wearing."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"We haven't had anyone like that come through here," the man
replied shortly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, what about the other precincts?" Daria asked, trying
to stay reasonable and not sound like she was addressing a Kevin-clone.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She longed to slip in a subtle barb,
but her opponent held too much potentially valuable information for her to risk
antagonizing him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The man turned
to his computer, spent a few minutes bringing up the records -- leaving Daria
and Jane to drum their fingers on the desk in apprehension -- and then finally
turned back to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"We aren't holding any John Does of that description
anywhere in the city," he said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Jane thanked him, and they both made a beeline to the door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Time to check the hospitals now," Daria said, fighting off
discouragement at having come up with nothing at their first stop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"If he's not in one now," Jane replied, her tone not a
threat but a promise, "he will be after I find him."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From the second they entered the first hospital on their
list, Jane wanted to pivot on her heel and walk out as quickly as
possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The large, spacious
building felt like a prison, the white-clad doctors and nurses who were rushing
about seeming more like jailors and tormentors than healers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She felt a horrible premonition that at
any second they would take hold of her and lock her in a small, barren room
where they could work their tortures at their leisure.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But she forced herself to place one
foot in front of the other; she was starting to question whether such strange
sensations and urges belonged to her, or whether they emanated from the
enigmatic presence she now felt continuously looking over her shoulder.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She took satisfaction in allowing none
of her anxiety to show as she questioned nurse receptionists in building after
building, to see if they had any patients matching the description of her
brother.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After a couple of futile stops, the questioning had finally
borne fruit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The woman at the
reception desk had informed her that they indeed had just this morning brought
in a John Doe matching Wind's description, found unconscious in the alley next
to a seedy downtown bar, his wallet and ID already lifted.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane, as a possible relative, had been
allowed in to see the man, though Daria had to wait in the entrance room; now,
she was walking down a long highway, a friendly nurse leading the way.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The woman's expressions of concern for
Jane's brother fell on nearly deaf ears, however, as Jane could not drag her
awareness away from the fact that she was burrowing ever further into the
warren of persecutors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At every door
they passed, Jane found herself wondering what horrors lay behind it, what poor
soul they had imprisoned therein; these insane fears would respond to no reason
she could command.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her own fears
of losing herself to this interloping spirit, as she already seemed to be
losing her art, were only an extra layer to add to her apprehension.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Though the corridor looked to stretch on into eternity,
eventually the nurse stopped at one open door and gestured Jane inside.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There, lying on a bed, was a man, in
his early thirties, with blonde hair down to his shoulders.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tubes in both his arms connected him to
IV bags, while his heartrate was monitored through several electrodes attached
to his chest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The steady "beep, beep,
beep" of the EKG reminded Jane of every movie and television show she had ever
seen that was based in a hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The man, though bearing a superficial resemblance, was clearly not Wind,
but Jane did not tell the nurse this; instead, she walked slowly up to the
patient's side, staring not at his face, but at his chest.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The tiny white circles connected to his
skin fascinated her; of their own accord, her hands reached out to touch them,
to trace their circumferences and feel the slick plastic against her
fingers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, suddenly,
fascination turned to rage, and with an explosion of fury she yanked every one
of them from his body in a single jerk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The machines went haywire with alarms and protests, reading only that
the heartbeat they had been detecting was no longer there, certain that the man
in their care was now near death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Jane felt herself seized from behind, but the restraint was no longer
necessary; she was once again in her own mind, her body under her control, the
outburst now nothing but a memory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Young lady," the nurse said, sounding more shocked than
angry, "what do you think you're doing?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm . . . I'm sorry," Jane replied, and then stopped
cold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What could she possibly say
to explain this?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What possible
rational reason could she give that anyone would accept?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How could she say that the actions were
not hers, that some <i>thing</i><span style='font-style:normal'> had been
operating through her, using her arms as though she was nothing more than a
marionette for its amusement?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
the end, she said the only thing she could think of that would not make the
situation infinitely worse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"This isn't my brother.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I'll go now."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She stumbled backwards, for a few seconds unable to tear her
eyes away from the sight of the nurse rapidly reattaching the monitors she had
so rudely removed, then she turned and ran, out the door and down the corridor,
as fast as she could without toppling over the denizens of the hospital that
walked or rolled up and down the hall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When she reached the entranceway, where Daria was waiting, she didn't
even stop for explanations, but simply grabbed her friend's arm and propelled
her outside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria bore this odd behavior for a few seconds, then shook
her off and demanded to know what the hell was going on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Something happened to me inside there," Jane said.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Up until now, I've made some weird
sketches, including some that I didn't want to make, and I've had some weird
feelings, but it still always seemed like <i>me </i><span style='font-style:
normal'>who was doing it</span><i>.</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I just did something in there that
wasn't me at all; </span><i>it</i><span style='font-style:normal'> was working
through me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Whatever it is, it
hates hospitals and doctors and maybe machines, I'm not sure.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But for a few seconds in there, there
wasn't a separation between what I was feeling and what it was feeling.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was like an out-of-body experience.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't think I've been more terrified
in my life."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a few seconds, Daria didn't respond, just stared into
Jane's eyes as if trying to read her soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, it's still me, I promise," Jane said
desperately.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"For now, at least."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I know that," Daria responded.<span style="mso-spacerun:

my own voice instead."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, what's going to happen to us?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria lay collapsed on the hotel room bed, changing channels
with just the merest flick of her thumb.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She had brought along <i>Going After Cacciato</i><span style='font-style:
normal'> in case she had the time and the desire to read, but after the
harrowing day Jane and she had experienced, with nothing to show for their
efforts and agonies except a few possibilities checked off their list, she was
too physically and emotionally exhausted to absorb the story.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So she entertained herself through the
only means left to her, the television.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At least, that had been the plan, but it seemed that the TV
had other plans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even with the
cable connection, static filled the screen as the picture rolled up and down;
it was doing this on every channel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Even the little bit of image that Daria could catch between the snow was
disappointing; Daria couldn't identify a single object, but everything looked
in black and white.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was
certain that she had paid for a better room than this, but there were more
important things to do with their time tomorrow than make complaints.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, she gave up and just turned it
off, lying staring at the wall in front of her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Off to her side, she could hear Jane's pencil scratching.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane was determined to reclaim her
talent, and from the second they had returned to their room from their last
hospital stop she had been attempting to capture the figures and faces of the
more colorful characters they had seen since coming to Baltimore Wednesday
morning, at the harbor and the police station and the hospitals.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her concentration was intense, her eyes
boring holes into the paper held in her hands, so Daria had not interrupted to
see how things were going.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
now, Daria noticed that the scratchings were becoming rapid and harsh, frantic
even; she swung her head over to see Jane holding her pencil like a psycho
wielding a knife, attacking her sketchbook with the point, first pressing down
with such force that the paper buckled, and then actively stabbing, ramming the
point through the leaves again and again and again.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, with a bellow of raw anguish, she shot to her feet and
hurled the sketchbook across the room, and stood there fire-faced, chest rising
and falling as she sucked in air, eyes wild.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Training for Olympic sketch throwing," Daria said, falling
back on the familiar since she had no idea of what else to say, "or are you
planning on going pro?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"My art has been hijacked!" Jane wailed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I can't stop it!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There's nothing left in me but <i>that</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
waved in the direction of her pictures, now lying against the far wall.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria opened her mouth to say something
she hoped would be comforting and reassuring, but switched gears when she
noticed a dark line on Jane's face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane, your nose is bleeding."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane put her hand up to her face, and her fingers came away
wet with the red fluid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Hissing an
obscenity through gritted teeth, she ran to the restroom to wash her face.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria pushed herself up from the bed
and walked over to where the sketchbook was lying open, picked it up, and began
to flip through the last few filled pages.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>At first, it looked as though Jane was starting to succeed;
there were several renderings of dockworkers and some of the criminals they had
caught glimpses of at the police station, all done in Jane's inimitable style,
but in each case the face was obliterated.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, further on, all those disappeared, and the last few
pages were filled with nothing but rings, small, large, thick, and thin, all of
them scratched out with little consideration for neatness or elegance, just
passion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And, in the center, there
was a single human figure: a woman whose long black hair covered her face.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The figure was disconcerting,
unsettling; Daria felt that her mysterious hidden face was staring out at her
from the drawing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nervously, she
carefully closed the cover and laid it back down on the floor, not wanting to
have any more to do with it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Through the entrance to the restroom, Daria heard Jane's voice raised in
irate frustration.</p>

<h1>Friday</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They spent most of the next morning at the local Kinko's,
designing and copying flyers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
papers were straightforward, including only a description of Wind, their phone
number at the hotel, and a cash reward for information leading to Wind's
discovery, calculated by Daria out of what she projected would be left over
after the hotel bill and food for the week was subtracted from her cabin
fund.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She hated parting with the
fruits of years of saving, but after the events of the day and night before,
finding out what Wind might know was looking less and less like an option and
more like an absolute necessity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Jane hadn't said a word about her outburst since, but she had been more
quiet than usual, and Daria could tell that it was weighing heavily on
her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had tossed off a comment
that it would have been nice to have a picture of Wind to include on the flyer,
and had even managed to make it sound casual, but the bitter undercurrent was
plain to Daria's ears.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After tossing down another large pile of cash for the
flyers, Daria and Jane proceeded to spend the early afternoon plastering them
up all over downtown.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Separating
would have been quicker, but Jane said that the kind of places in which Wind
might have ended up were not the sorts of environments two young women should
be alone in, even during the day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>So they walked along together, taping up paper to poles already covered
in a thick layer of it, and commenting on the contents of those older
advertisements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Once, Jane even
thought she saw a fragment of the Mystik Spiral logo, but after a little
digging they discovered it was a flyer for some goth-metal band named Mystikal
Warriors; Jane commented that Baltimore was a bit out of the Spiral's league
anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Altogether, the afternoon
was the closest they had come to forgetting, for a little while, the horrors
that were pursuing them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When they got back to the hotel, late that afternoon,
several messages were already waiting for them.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane pressed the button next to the blinking red light, and
routed the calls through to the speakerphone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hey, dude, I saw your guy, man.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He was comin' out of a monkey's ass!"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The caller dissolved into coarse
laughter, or at least as far as they could tell.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The rowdy bar noises behind him made his voice a bit
difficult to make out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane hit
the skip forward button with unnecessary force, and the next message
played.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, it was of
the same sort, as were the three that followed it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm beginning to think," Daria commented,<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"that there might be a downside to
getting information from people hanging out in bars in the middle of the day."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's just a good thing that we aren't both using video
phones," Jane replied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"These guys
are asses enough without actually having to see theirs."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even among all the dreck, though, there were a few gems; a
few callers reported what sounded like legitimate sightings, and free of
charge, while a few others left their own numbers for them to call, just to
make sure that money would be paid if everything panned out.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane contacted them, and within the
hour they had a list of locations where men who looked like Wind had been
spotted; of course, they would have preferred some confirmation of the
possibility, but most of the callers didn't know what the man was wanted for,
and so were hesitant to approach him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Still, it was a start, and better than nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They had a quick bite to eat, and were walking through the
streets of downtown by nightfall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The sun was setting, and the streets were filling up with Friday night
revelers; Daria soon wearied of dodging back and forth to avoid enthusiastic
and inebriated pedestrians, and wished that they had timed their search better,
maybe come on a Monday night when people were too depressed by the workweek
ahead to crowd the sidewalk so inconveniently.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The mass of people was not helping her now-constant sense of
being watched, and her nerves were starting to fray.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After what seemed an eternity, they reached the first
establishment on their list; from the line of people moving in, it looked
pretty popular.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They were carding
at the door, but hopefully that would not be an issue -- both Daria and Jane had
fake ID's, procured for them by Trent (who of course kept his source a secret,
with vague mysterious hints of his "connections") so that they could get into
McGrundy's Pup to see the Spiral play.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They were good enough to pass inspection there, though that wasn't a
really high standard, and Daria was hoping that the bars here operated by the
same principles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And she was
right; the bouncer waved them in with only a cursory glance at their
credentials.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Inside it was dark, crowded, and noisy, most of the light
coming from the televisions that lined every wall, showing various sporting
events.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Idly, Daria wondered what
would happen should a particularly sadistic person should slip the videotape
into one of the broadcasts; how many people would see it, and how many would be
able to handle the aftereffects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>We
don't even know if we've seen all the aftereffects yet.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Do you see anyone who could be Wind?" Daria asked Jane; she
had to yell to make her voice heard over the din.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane looked around for a while, and then, saving her voice,
wordlessly pointed to a man sitting on a barstool, his back to them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He certainly looked like Wind, with his
blonde hair to his shoulders and slight build, along with a slight slouch.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They walked up behind him, and Jane
tapped him on the shoulder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
turned around to reveal his face . . .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>. . . and he had no face.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>His face looked warped, melted, very much like how she and
Jane had looked in the security monitor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria gasped and jumped back, almost tripping on a stool.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She blinked hard, and when she opened
her eyes, everything was back to normal; the man's face was completely normal,
but it wasn't Wind's.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Damn
nerves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Damn tape.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Damn Wind.</i><span style='font-style:
normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane was already
apologizing for disturbing the man; she didn't seem to have even noticed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next couple of stops were uneventful, then they
encountered a wrinkle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When they
passed over their ID's to the bouncer, he looked both of them up and down, and
gave their cards back with a scowl.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, I can believe <i>her</i><span style='font-style:normal'>,"
he said, gesturing at Jane, and then turned to Daria, "but there's no way </span><i>you're</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> twenty-one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You'll have to stay out here."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Jane turned to leave, but Daria stopped her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Wind could be in there, Jane," she said, "and we can't
afford to miss him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'll be fine
out here for a few minutes."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane
didn't look too certain, but she assured Daria she would be out soon and then
ducked inside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria wandered over
to the side of the building; she knew exactly why she had been left out.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It wasn't hard to guess that they were
both underaged; that wasn't why Jane had been let in and she left out.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But even with her eccentric dress and
deliberately-odd makeup, Jane was attractive.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Not a great beauty, but certainly enough to attract male
interest; on the other hand, though Daria knew she could be that way if she put
the effort into it, it had never seemed important to her, so she disdained
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Usually, that was the way she
liked it, and it had rarely caused what she considered to be problems; but when
it did, such as now, it rankled her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She had been separated from her friend solely because the bouncer had
been on the lookout for pretty girls, and she hated him for it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria was so engrossed in her thoughts that she did not, at
first, notice the approaching stranger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was obviously drunk, swerving left and right on his feet, his face
bearing the too-wide smile of the pleasantly intoxicated.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then he started to get just a little
too close, and Daria became suddenly very aware indeed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hey, gorgeous," he said, "you feeling lonely tonight?"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At least, that was what she thought he
said; the individual words were rather difficult to make out.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not that she wanted to make them out in
the first place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I was," she replied coldly, "but soon my muscular biker
boyfriend Knuckles is going to be here, and if he finds another man talking to
me, he'll fly into a homicidal rage."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"We'll just have to hurry then," he said, and reached out
for her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria backed up out of
his reach, but to her dismay found herself pressed up against the wall, with
too many other people around to run very far to either side.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His hand reached up to her neck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And suddenly there was long, black hair covering her face,
and she was being choked, but from behind.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She could feel two strong hands wrapping around her
windpipe, crushing the life from her body, the world growing fainter and
fainter by the second.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She wanted
to scream, but couldn't get the air.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The hair covering her face got into her mouth; she tried to spit it out,
but whenever she gasped for air she would get another mouthful.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Panic rose until coherent thought
became impossible, and all she could do was pant instinctively for air, but
there was no air to be had . . .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then it was over, and Daria found herself slumped against
the wall, lungs heaving, as several people bent over her, asking if she was
alright.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Others were carrying off
the man who had accosted her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria couldn't speak, but just kept searching the sea of worried faces
until she finally found Jane's, pushing her way through the crowd.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"My god, Daria," she exclaimed, "what happened?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I heard you screaming inside the
bar."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane's eyes were wide with
shock, and she quickly looked Daria up and down, searching for wounds.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, Daria found the air and the
composure to speak.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It . . . it was another vision," she whispered, not wanting
to have this conversation go beyond the two of them.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Her hands and her voice were shaking.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"When he touched my neck, I felt like I
was being strangled, but not by him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And it wasn't <i>me</i><span style='font-style:normal'>, either."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She looked into Jane's eyes, and saw
that her friend knew exactly what she meant.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane slung Daria's arm over her shoulders, and helped her to
her feet; they started to walk down the street, the crowd parting before them,
connected together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Come on, <i>amiga</i><span style='font-style:normal'>,"
Jane said tenderly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I think it's
time for both of us to get some rest."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria shot straight up in bed, heart pounding, as the final
image of her nightmare faded into the dark hotel room around her.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Turning towards the one source of light
available to her -- the window, which was starting to show the grey glow of
pre-dawn -- she saw Jane's figure silhouetted against it, head down, staring at
the hands folded in her lap.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane," she said, her voice still morning-hoarse, "what are
you doing up so early?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I had a nightmare," she said flatly, bluntly.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her voice quivered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah, so did I," Daria replied.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"I guess it's not so surprising, considering what's been
happening to us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What did <i>you</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> dream about?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane took a deep, stabilizing breath, than began.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I was standing in someplace cold and dark, and wet.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was waist deep in water, and the
ground was muddy, so anytime I stepped I had to yank my foot up.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not that there was a lot of room to
walk; there was a stone wall all around me.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I could feel it with my hands, though I couldn't see
anything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The walls were slimy
with algae, and the whole place stank.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As far as I could tell, there wasn't any roof, and all I could see above
me was a ring of light, just like the one at the beginning of the tape.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I panicked, and tried to climb up and
out of the place, but I didn't get anywhere, and the rough walls just tore the
skin off my fingertips.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally,
just before I was going to really flip out, I woke up.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That was hours ago now."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The whole time she was talking, her
gaze did not leave her lap.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That definitely sounds disturbing," Daria acknowledged,
"and I'm sure Freud would have lots of things to say about it, but why didn't
you just go back to sleep?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Because I haven't told you the worst part of it yet," Jane
replied, her tone heavy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then,
silently, she held up her hands so that Daria could see them in the light.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The fingers were bloody, all the skin
missing from each one of their tips.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Good God, Jane!" Daria yelped, shocked out of her fatigue
and any sense of restraint.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
knew this was impossible (though her sense of what was and was not possible had
already come under considerable strain these last few days), but her brain
couldn't deal with that yet, so it resorted to more pragmatic matters.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She jumped out of bed and ran over to
Jane, taking her hands gently and examining the wounds.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"These haven't even been washed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You need to clean these, and bandage
them, right now."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sorry, I didn't bring my first-aid kit."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'll rip up some of my clean socks to use for
bandages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While I'm doing that,
wash your hands in the sink."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Obediently, Jane did as she was told, but while Daria was
tearing her socks into strips, she heard a cry of pain from restroom, followed
by a plea for assistance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
stepped through the door to find Jane fumbling with the soap, unable to hold it
without it slipping from her blood-slicked hands.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Without words, Daria took one of her hands in hers, and with
the other started to rub the bar of soap along her wounds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"There has to be some rational explanation for this," she
muttered, half to herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now
that the pragmatics were being taken care of, there was nothing left to
distract her from the more disturbing implications.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"Maybe you clawed the wall or the bedframe while you were
sleeping."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sorry, <i>amiga</i><span style='font-style:normal'>," Jane
responded, "they're clean as a whistle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I looked."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, there has to be something.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal>"Man, I wish this was the Matrix.<span style="mso-spacerun:

happened."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, no," Daria said emphatically.<span style="mso-spacerun:

you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What was your dream about?" Jane asked, as Daria turned off
the water and began to wrap her fingers with the strips of her sock.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It started with me waking up in this room," she said
slowly, remembering, almost reliving, the vivid dream, half-afraid of what was
going to happen next.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I needed to
pee, so I went into the restroom and turned on the light, but instead of seeing
my own reflection in the mirror, I saw someone else."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She shivered involuntarily.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"It was a little girl, about ten years old or so.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was dressed in a flowing white
dress, and had long black hair that fell to her waist, framing an extremely
pale face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She made me look like I
have a tan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She wasn't ugly -- in
fact, she was even kind of attractive -- but there was something about her that
seemed very wrong, very eerie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
even looked familiar to me, like someone I had seen before, out of the corner
of my eye.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I walked up to the
mirror and tried to meet her gaze, but I couldn't quite make eye contact; there
was something hideous in her stare, and I just didn't have the courage."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her pulse and breathing had quickened,
and Daria had to pause to take a few calming breaths.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>To this point, the dream had seemed almost mundane, and yet,
even in her sleep when she was experiencing it for the first time, she had
already become quite uneasy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I
asked her who she was, and she didn't answer, just kept looking at me as though
she were examining an insect pinned to her card.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I asked her what she wanted, and she still didn't answer,
but she smiled."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria stopped
abruptly, and swallowed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
memory of that smile had made her heart nearly stop, she felt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"If you don't want to go on," Jane said, looking concerned,
"that's fine."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, I'm all right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It's just still a bit disturbing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But that smile, Jane -- it was like nothing I have ever seen before.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was pure evil, hatred, malevolence;
that's the only thing I can think of to describe it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I could tell right then what she wanted -- she wanted me
dead, and she was going to enjoy every minute of it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Then she reached out from the mirror and grabbed my arm, and
started to pull me in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was like
being touched by living flame; I've never felt anything like it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I screamed, and then woke up."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria finished tying up the bandages on
Jane's fingers, and just in time; her hands were shaking so much that she could
barely finish the knots.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane was
staring at Daria's arm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It looks like I'm not the only one with a souvenir from a
dream," she said quietly, almost in a whisper.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What do you mean?" Daria replied, puzzled, and not sure she
wanted to know the answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane took Daria's arm and pushed up her sleeve, tilting her
forearm into view.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There, formed
from what looked like scar tissue from a long-healed burn, was the print of a
small hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Come on, Daria, after last night, you have to admit
something unnatural is going on."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria and Jane sat across from each other, sitting at a
booth in a pizza place near the hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria welcomed the familiarity of the situation; it felt like the last
support shoring up the increasingly shaky construct that was her life.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After last night, her skepticism had
taken a nasty blow, and she was struggling to find some kind of rational,
ordinary cause that could explain it all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The bandages on the tips of Jane's fingers were mocking her, challenging
her for an explanation; she made sure to keep the long sleeves of her own jacket
all the way down, completely covering her arms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That girl you saw in the mirror," Jane said, "has to be the
same one I drew in my book; the woman with the long hair.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She has to be the spirit behind it
all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Why else would she be trying
to scare us?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Why else would you
have dreamed her?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Probably because I saw that picture you drew," Daria
replied, trying to maintain her normal monotone in the face of rising doubt and
frustration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I will admit that
the picture disturbed me, but that's all the more reason my mind would have
included her in my nightmare."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Do girls in pictures do this?" Jane demanded, and pushed up
Daria's sleeve to reveal the brown handprint.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And, of course, that was the clincher, the thing that Daria
could not explain, the fatal flaw in her argument.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But that didn't mean she was quite ready to concede the war.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Just because I don't know how it happened," she said,
"doesn't mean there isn't a rational cause.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>There are a lot of weird things in the world that I can't
explain; that doesn't mean I'm going to blame them all on ghosts and
goblins.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If we did that, then
hundreds of years of science would be worthless; we might as well start making
offerings to the rain gods in the hopes of a good harvest."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane held up her fingers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, this doesn't just happen on its own.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We both know there is no way something
like last night could just happen naturally; if it could, then people would
wake up wounded from nightmares all the time.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><i>She</i><span style='font-style:normal'> did this to
us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She's just as real as you or I
are.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And I don't think we are
going to be able to stop her until you acknowledge that she exists."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's not that simple," Daria snapped, almost losing her
temper at her friend's insistence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She paused for a few seconds to calm down.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"This isn't a movie, Jane, where the lifelong skeptic can just
see a ghost and be magically transformed into a believer.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've lived my entire life under the
assumption that <i>this</i><span style='font-style:normal'> is all there is,
that if I can't see it, hear it, feel it, or test it, then it doesn't
exist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no god ruling over
us, no angels guarding us, and certainly no ghosts haunting us.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The possibility that there might be,
that there is a reality beyond what I have always known, is not just a new
piece of information I can stitch on to my worldview and go on as before.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If I believed that, I would have to
reevaluate every aspect of my life, rethink every important decision I have
ever made.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It would completely
revolutionize my outlook on life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>So, before I make such a staggering change, I need to be absolutely
certain of my reasons for doing so."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Jane pierced her with an assessing gaze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So it's not really that you <i>can't</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> believe," she said slowly, piecing it all together,
"but that it would be a lot of trouble to change your mind."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She paused; Daria knew she was waiting
for her to contradict that statement, to explain that she had it all wrong, but
though Daria thought that Jane was putting too much of a negative spin on her
position, she was essentially right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"But the Daria Morgendorffer I know would never allow inconvenience to
stand in the way of truth; she would believe it if it was true, no matter what
the cost to her might be, or prove it to be false.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>What are you going to do?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fortunately, the waiter chose that exact moment to arrive
with their pizza, sparing Daria from the necessity of an answer to a question
she had yet to be able to solve, despite having turned it over and over in her
head continuously the entire morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Or maybe the arrival of the pizza was not so fortunate after all, for as
soon as it was set down on the table, its accustomed shape sprang out at both
of them; they couldn't see the greasy cheese or the steaming toppings, just the
ring formed by the outer crust.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, do you see . . . ?"<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane's voice was small.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, I do," Daria replied.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"Maybe we should have rethought our meal choices.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I think I've lost my appetite."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Me, too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
know, when this thing interferes with our pizza time, it really has gone too
far."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Or maybe it's just trying to save us from an early,
cholesterol-induced death."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So she's sort of a Casper the friendly ghost type of
thing."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Except for the visions and horrible nightmares."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Are you going to eat this?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't think I can.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Nope.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Let's
get out of here."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Leaving their money on the table, they walked out of the
restaurant and started the short walk down the street to their lodgings.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An inescapable feeling of futility
overwhelmed Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"We're never going to find Wind this way," she said, "not
unless we get very lucky, and I think we've both seen the extent of our
luck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There must be another way to
go about it, some clue that we're not seeing."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria tried to think of something they might have missed,
some heretofore un-thought-of method of searching that might produce Jane's
elusive brother, but couldn't think of anything other than to just keep on
doing what they were already doing, and hope that they stumbled upon him in the
next two days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'll call Trent when we get back to our room," Jane
replied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Maybe Wind showed up and
he forgot to call, or just never got around to it."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane shrugged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"It's worth a try, at least."</p>

number.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Summer," Jane replied shortly, concentrating on her
dialing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"She's the oldest, so she
would probably have the best memory of where this place is.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Hi, Summer, it's Jane . . . no, I don't
know where Courtney and Adrian are; the last time I saw them was the last time
I saw you . . . Summer, I don't have time to chat.<span style="mso-spacerun:

Summer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Gotta run.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bye."<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"The cabin is in West Virginia," Daria said, stating what
she knew as a fact rather than asking for confirmation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah," Jane answered, sounding unsure.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"When my parents wanted to get away,
they didn't do it half-assed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's
about a four-hour drive, and then we have to hike the last few miles through
the mountains.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The problem is,
getting there and back will use up most of our remaining time, especially since
we'll probably have to spend tonight there, even if we leave now.<span

person.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Plus, maybe the reason we
couldn't reach Wind on his cell phone was not because he hadn't paid his bill,
but because he was out of range in the mountains.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I'd say we have as good odds there as here, and I'm more
willing to risk hillbillies over barflies.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal>At first, the highway trip through Maryland was nothing out
of the ordinary; Daria and Jane talked of normal subjects, doing their best to
not dwell on the disturbing events of the past few days, or on the uncertainty
of finding Wind at their destination.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But the tension didn't fade; Daria still felt like her nerves were on
edge, and their situation hung over the conversation like a black cloud that
neither of them wanted to acknowledge but of which both could feel the shadow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But as the straight highway gave way to country roads and
then to winding mountain trails, Daria felt her tension begin to ease up, at
least a little bit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
now-constant feeling of being watched didn't subside, but the change of scenery
helped in putting the events of the last few days behind her.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course, she had her own bad memories
of mountain county -- at least, she had thought that they were bad memories, but
viewed in the light of her newest recollections they seemed almost
paradisiacal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>We're Lawndale's
Wilderness Adventure Club, Mark 2.</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even Jane's adventurous sense of
driving seemed tame in comparison.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, they reached the end of the road; it dead-ended
into a wooded slope, with a narrow dirt trail leading up the mountain.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Another car was there waiting for them,
a beat-up old Ford.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane parked
the car behind it, and they got out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Please tell me this is Wind's," Daria said, resting her
hand on the hood of the jalopy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Tom's had been in worse shape, but not by much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yep, this is it," Jane said, and for the first time in
days, she smiled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Looks like
Trent had it right after all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'll
have to get him a set of guitar strings or something.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Come to think of it, I think this place looks a bit
familiar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's vague, but it does
feel like I've been here before."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She looked around, taking in the natural scenery.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Y'know, it's not all that bad out
here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pretty relaxing,
actually.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Wind rustling the tree branches,
babbling brooks, the song of birds . . ."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Banjos," Daria interjected. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Maybe it's time for you to start practicing squealing like
a pig."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane smirked, and wiggled
her eyebrows suggestively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sorry," Daria quipped back.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"High-pitched, inhuman squeals are Quinn's department."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane stared up at the trail before them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I would love to hear the sound she'd make at the thought of
a climb like this."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She took a
deep breath, and stepped onto the dirt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria followed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The climb was hard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If her run from Glen Oaks Lane to Howard Drive Wednesday morning had
shown her how much gym had kept her in shape, this ascent seemed determined to
pay her back for every complaint she had ever made about Ms. Morris.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even Jane was having a difficult time --
apparently running took different muscles than climbing -- and conversation soon
faded out, replaced by a few murmured imprecations and a lot of heavy
breathing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rest stops were as
frequent as they could justify them, balancing the necessity of recovery with
the driving desire to get to Wind as quickly as possible.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, every time, they dragged
themselves to their feet long before they felt rested, and made their way up
again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, just as the sun was setting behind the trees, the
path leveled off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They were
walking almost directly into the sunset, and the glow cast everything around
them into a red hue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It looked as
though they were walking through a forest of fire.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, in so smooth a transition they almost didn't notice
it, the trees that surrounded them <i>were</i><span style='font-style:normal'>
on fire, tongues of flame licking at their newly-bare branches, turning each
bough into a torch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They looked
around them in surprise, but little shock; there wasn't much left that could
shock them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"This isn't real, right?" Jane asked, in the tone of someone
who knows the answer but feels the need to say <i>something</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> in acknowledgement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm pretty sure it's not," Daria replied, in much the same
way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I think we'd be dead if it
were."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, at least this is pretty mild," Jane said.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"If this is all she has left to throw
at us, maybe things are starting to wind down.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe it all wears off in seven days, and we've been worrying
for nothing."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Or this is her resting until she really throws the shit at
us."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria realized that she had
just spoken of Jane's hypothetical spirit as though she were real.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Do I think that she is?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When did that happen?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Should I just let myself slide into
this paradigm shift?</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not she wanted to, she
didn't have the time or energy to fight it just then; she'd have to give the
whole matter serious thought later on, when she could devote all her energies
to the question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For now, the only
thing that mattered was to continue moving forward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sun was now completely set, and with the trees blocking
out almost all moonlight and starlight, and no manmade illumination within
miles, the trail became almost pitch-black.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The fiery trees burned on, but the flames shed no light
beyond their own borders; soon, they could only make out the trail by the path
it blazed through the light of the illusory inferno.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They kept walking, they didn't know how long.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then, ahead of them, they saw another flickering firelight
glow, but this one was on the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The trees thinned out into a clearing, in the center of which stood an
old-fashioned log cabin, looking in dire need of repair.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The light was coming from inside,
shining through the open spaces between the logs, its wavering orange glow a
beacon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The door opened with a
creak, and they stepped inside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The interior was only a single room, its walls and floor
glowing and flickering in time with the fire, built in a fireplace in one wall;
a single figure sat in front of it, staring into the flames.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was Wind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He turned when they came in, his expression mournful instead
of surprised.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He attempted a
sickly smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Janey," he said, "and . . ."<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria," she quickly filled in, before he could make another
humiliating guess.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He nodded
absently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He was about to say
something else, but Jane didn't give him the chance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Wind," she said briskly, walking up to stand beside his
sitting form, "did you leave a videotape at the house?"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Wind's eyes opened wide, and even
through the firelight his face paled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Jane's voice hardened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"What is it?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Wind
swallowed nervously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I heard that it was made by a little girl," he said,
sounding choked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Her mother
strangled her and threw her in a well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Her ghost made the tape to tell people what happened.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her name was Sam . . . Sammy . . .
Samantha . . ."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Samara</i><span style='font-style:normal'>, said a voice
in Daria's ear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The high-pitched
voice of a young girl.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Chills
enveloped her bones.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"My friend Danny gave it to me," Wind continued, looking up
at his younger sister looking lost and helpless.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"He said it was the best trip he ever had.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Kathy and I don't have a VCR, so I
brought it home, but I never could get up the courage to watch it."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He drew in a deep gasp, and his eyes
opened even wider, if that were possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"I didn't realize I had left it there until days later.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Janey, did you watch it?"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His voice rose in panic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, we both did," she replied.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, Janey," Wind said, on the verge of tears, "you have to
make a copy and show it to somebody else, or else you'll die exactly seven days
after you watched it!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria felt as though she had been punched in the stomach by
a hand wearing an iron gauntlet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

die, die . . .</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't know," he said, now weeping openly.<span

crazy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She's in a nuthouse now."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Are you sure about this, Wind?" Jane asked, fury growing in
her voice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Do you know anyone who
has actually died from this?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wind looked up at her in agony.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Danny.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Two
days after he gave it to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
paper said he died of a heart attack, but I know better."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He finally dissolved completely into
tears, clutching Jane's feet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
stood above him like an avenging angel, or a wrathful demon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Get out, Wind," she said, at first a whisper, then with
increasing fury.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Get out.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Get out!<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>GET OUT!!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
drew back her foot, looking as though she was going to kick him, but he jumped
away and ran out into the dark.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>His cries and sobs faded into the noises of the mountain night.<span

<p class=MsoNormal>For a minute, everything was silent.<span

to Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane, we're going to be killed by a kid," Daria said, and
almost laughed at the grim absurdity of it.<span style="mso-spacerun:

much actually separates her from me?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't think that's all that it is," Jane said, "at least,
that's not the feeling I'm getting from her.<span style="mso-spacerun:

</span>Daria looked at Jane in mild surprise, and then they both knew that the
other had heard as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I think
she wants everyone to know how it felt, what it was like to <i>be</i><span

doubt that her life was a happy one."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That may be so, but we can't help her."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria inhaled deeply, steadying herself
to shore up her decision, the only one that in good conscience she could
make.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"We can't pass this on; I
can't have another person's death on my conscience.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria," Jane said in surprise, "surely you can't think that
our tape is the only copy?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There's
probably hundreds of them out there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Letting ourselves die isn't going to stop her.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, but then he'll make a copy, and the person he gives it

her plan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And all of those copies
will be out there, each one descended from us.<span style="mso-spacerun:

like us, someone who doesn't know what they have.<span style="mso-spacerun:

living; if I did that, I don't think that I <i>could</i><span style='font-style:

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane didn't look convinced, and she avoided her friend's eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane," Daria said, the words cracking, "if you want to make

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, <i>amiga</i><span style='font-style:normal'>, you're
right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If I did that, I couldn't
live with myself either, knowing what I had done.<span style="mso-spacerun:

think that you're going to leave me here to face it alone."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She smiled, but there was little of
mirth in it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria responded in
kind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"So, what now?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"We'll stay here for the night," Daria replied, "now that
your brother has so graciously made way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Tomorrow, we'll go back to the hotel, destroy the tape, and head back
home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't remember exactly
when I watched the tape, but I'll at least have most of the day with my family
before the end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't think I'll
tell them about it, though; they can't do anything to prevent it, and if they
try, I'm afraid they might end up in Bedlam.<span style="mso-spacerun:

Daria regretted it as soon as it was out of her mouth.<span

it, well, I won't have that long to suffer."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane reached over and touched her on the shoulder, and
before either of them knew it, they were locked in a sorrowful embrace, each
giving comfort to the other, as only best friends could.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They held each other like this long
into the night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They started their climb down the mountain as soon as they
woke up the next morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Going
down proved to be even more strenuous than coming up, so conversation was once
again held to a minimum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The trees
surrounding them were back to normal, leafy branches green and lush, and the
forest teemed with the sounds of a thousand forms of life.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It seemed almost a mockery of their
situation, having to walk through such an explosion of life when their own lives
were now so close to their ends; but it was also a comforting reminder, that
though their own existence was drawing to a close, that the world would keep
going, that Samara's victory was far from complete.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Though there were clouds gathering on the eastern horizon,
the sky above them was clear and blue, and the sunlight reached them
unhindered, making their coming demise seem distant and unreal; ghosts were
creatures of night and shadow, how could one reach them in the bright light of
day?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria knew that such feelings
were an illusion, hardly borne out by their experiences, but she appreciated
the relief from the heavy dread and the sense of impending doom that had
haunted her night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Eventually, after several hours of exhausting decent, they
finally reached the car, parked unmolested right where they had left it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria took the wheel for their drive
back to Baltimore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After just a
few minutes of rest, they started to talk, but it was not of the great and terrible
revelation of the night before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria told Jane of her life in Highland, the armpit of Texas; she told
of her isolation and loneliness, of how the only two people who came close to
being her friends were two degenerate morons with whom she only associated for
the sake of amusement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She told of
her parents' fights, her trouble in school, her increasing desperation at her
own position.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She told her of
first hearing about the move to Lawndale, of her pessimistic assumption that
there would be no one for her there, since she had come to assume such a person
did not exist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane told Daria of
her growing up almost abandoned by her parents, since they had begun to place
their own muse's call above their own children; of being raised almost
completely by Trent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She told of
settling into her grip of her own muse, seeing the world and the people around
her as mere grist for her artistic mill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She told of taking the school's self-esteem class month after month
after month, because she had no other way to spend her time.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She told of growing up with Kevin and
Brittany, Jodie and Mack, Upchuck, Andrea, and everyone else they knew; how
they had started off as friends, in the manner of young children, but how age
had separated them into groups, and how Jane had found herself in a group of
one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They both talked of their three years together, recounting
old escapades and reviving old jokes, and recalled the stupidity and conformity
of their classmates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of their
families and their teachers and their peers, all observed through a distancing
filter of bemusement and frustration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There were no new stories here, they had heard them all before, but they
found that, while these memories had once been objects of scorn, they were now
fondly treasured, despite their absurdities, because of their absurdities.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Little snippets of life, with all the
slings and arrows that it is heir to; they did not want to let it go.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither of them admitted to feeling
this way, but it was growing in their hearts all the same.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But as they clouds started to roll in, and the world turned
to grey around them, their minds came around once again to face what was ahead
of them, instead of what was behind, and conversation stalled.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They spent some time in silence, Daria
focused on the road ahead, Jane staring out the window.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, turning to face Daria once again,
she broke the silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Y'know," she said, "people always say to live every day
like it is going to be your last, and I always thought that was what I was
doing."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her voice was soft,
reflective.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"<i>Carpe diem</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Follow
your dreams.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Live every day with
gusto, and you will have no regrets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They think </span><i>that</i><span style='font-style:normal'> means
living every day as though you weren't going to get another one.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But now, I don't feel like any of that
at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was fun, but I want to
spend my last day just being with the people I care about, and screw all the rest
of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If I can spend my last few
hours with you and Trent, I'll feel like I've really spent my last day well,
even if I can't tell Trent that's what it is.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I'll have no regrets."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She fell silent, but after a few moments, Daria filled the hush.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't think I've lived that way at all," she said slowly,
heavily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I've been treating my
life so far as a prologue, just a waiting period or a purgatory, before my
'real life' begins.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I thought
grade school was just what was leading into my life, preparing me for it; but
what I thought was prologue has turned out to be the whole story.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It all feels so unfinished; I feel like
I have left nothing completed, neither my writing nor my relationships.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And now it's all over."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria felt sick, her stomach twisted in
knots, and so heavy she found it hard just to make her arms move to steer.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane contemplated her quietly for a
while, then spoke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, what do you think is going to happen to you after
you die?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'll be buried in a plot with green grass and a relatively
expensive headstone," she replied, her voice bitterly humorous.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Dad will come visit me every day and
spend the whole time yelling at his father about how it's his fault I'm in
here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mom will come, when she
finds the time between cases, and spend most of the time talking to Eric on the
cell phone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And Quinn will never
visit, because nothing can destroy a girl's popularity faster than being
associated with death."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Really?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Personally, I plan on being stuffed and mounted."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane attempted a smile, but it died
quickly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"But seriously, Daria,
we've never actually discussed it; what do you think is going to happen to you
after you die?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"We've never discussed it because, despite what Mr. O'Neill
might think, I don't like to sit around thinking about death."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her hands tightened on the wheel; even
with the topic unavoidably in the air, she still didn't like the idea of
speaking of that dark unknown which now seemed all too near.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"But you must have some opinion.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And if you're going to think about death, now's the time."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I suppose I think that, once you die, that's it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The brain stops working, and it's
pretty much lights out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The body
decays, and in the end, it's like you were never here to begin with."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So you don't think there's any kind of afterlife?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't see how there could be; once the brain is gone, the
person's gone."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"And what about this last week?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>What about that girl that Wind says was murdered, the one
that supposedly made the tape, the one you and I have both seen?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You act like you've accepted her
existence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Doesn't that change
your mind?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If there is an
afterlife, don't you think there might still be a way to complete everything
that you don't think you've finished?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a long moment, Daria was silent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
I don't think I would want to be part of an afterlife with such creatures as
her in it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The rest of the drive was mostly silent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They arrived back in Baltimore by early evening, stepping
wearily into their hotel room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria wanted nothing more than to see the end of this place and return
home to the family that now felt to precious to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But she wouldn't see them for a while yet; they had decided
that the Morgendorffer family would have enough on their plate with Daria's
death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Having Jane die in their
home just a few hours earlier would be too much to ask them to deal with.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So they would stay at Jane's place, the
two of them and Trent, until Jane's death the following morning.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Only then would Daria go home, to spend
a few final hours with her family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But she was ready to take the initial step -- the night drive
back to Lawndale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They both packed
their things quickly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Don't forget to make sure you still have the tape," Jane
said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria turned to look at her
in surprise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I thought you had it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Their eyes widened as they realized what had happened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"How could we have done that?" Jane exclaimed.<span

were going to bring it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I thought you were going to," Daria replied, and then
clarity hit her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"It's
Samara.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She wants the tape to keep
moving on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She's the one who made
Wind leave it for us, and now we've left it for . . ."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She sucked in her breath in horror.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria and Jane finally stepped through the door of the Lane
home late that evening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No lights
were on, and the place was steeped in shadow, the only illumination coming from
the streetlights seen through the window.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The house was vacant, but it was not empty; it was filled with a
palpable presence, brooding and malevolent, awaiting its time.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now that Daria <i>knew</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> she was being watched, she no longer had the urge to
constantly check over her shoulder; in fact, she had become, not comfortable,
but accustomed to this ever present consciousness.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But now, back in familiar surroundings not associated with
the horrors of the past week, it was like she was feeling Samara's presence for
the very first time, and the hostility she sensed in it made her insides
quiver.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>Were you always
like this, Samara?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Were you born
with this evil inside you?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Or, at
one time, were you just a scared child, wondering why your Mommy wanted to hurt
you?</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>No answer was forthcoming.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria followed Jane to her bedroom, where everything was as
they had left it: the defaced older works in a haphazard pile, the
Samara-induced paintings scattered across the room as though flung about in a
frenzy, and at the epicenter of it all, the mutilated white canvas emblazoned
with a dark ring.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The insignia
Samara had taken as her own, a silent reminder of the influence she now held
over them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Wordlessly, Jane took
out the embedded brush, and grasping both sides of the hole she had made,
ripped the painting apart in a feat of furious strength, then hurled the ruined
frame against the wall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The frame
broke, and it fell limp to the floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"She may take me," Jane said, and it sounded like a vow,
"but she won't control what it is I leave behind.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She won't take my legacy."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And with that, she took up a hammer and walked around the
room, systematically destroying every painting she had made while under
Samara's influence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria just watched
in silence, knowing Jane was doing what she had to do.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, they both stood in a room full
of ruined works of art; the hammer dropped from Jane's nerveless fingers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Listen to me, Samara!" she declared to the air surrounding
her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I am going to paint.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I may not be able to control myself if
you take me over, but I won't stop trying to create my own work.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I will fight you every inch of the
way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I am Jane Lane, <i>artiste
extraordinaire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></i><span
style='font-style:normal'>And that is what I will be until the brush drops from
my dead fingers."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She picked up a blank canvas and set it on the easel.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Taking up a brush, she began to paint.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1>Monday</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria was awakened the next morning by a gentle shake from
Jane.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Before she even opened her
eyes, she could hear the sound of heavy knocking and an angry voice being
filtered through the front door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria was lying sprawled on the bed, having finally given into
exhaustion after spending hours watching Jane paint with a vengeance,<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>starting new works time after time, and
then discarding them as soon as the first hint of Samara's influence became
noticeable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her efforts had yielded
no clear successes, but there were no complete failures either; there were no
faces anywhere to be seen, and there were many images of wells, ladders,
horses, and rings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But there were
also many pictures Jane had nearly completed before detecting such intruders,
and these were enough to keep her going without fail, determined to not just
give up and let Samara win this battle as well.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane was still working as Daria's eyes slowly opened,
standing at her easel, brush in hand; from the number of new paintings
scattered about, it was clear that she had worked straight through the
night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She smirked at Daria; the
voice coming through the door was clearly that of Helen Morgendorffer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sounds like we've been found out, <i>amiga</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>," she said, her voice raspy from the early hour.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Ignore her and she'll go away," Daria replied.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane didn't know the exact time she
watched the tape, but it was sometime in the morning, and Daria didn't intend
to leave her friend's side until that moment.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The yelling and pounding continued unabated, Helen calling
for her daughter to come out and explain herself.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane turned her head towards the door for a moment, and then
looked back to Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Go on and talk to her," she said, jerking her head towards
the door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I don't think she's
just going to go away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm sure
that she's noticed that your car is here."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Are you sure?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria was nervous about the idea of leaving Jane for even a few moments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sure," Jane responded.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"I'll be fine by myself for a couple of minutes.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, do you really want your mother
angry at you today?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was
right; this was the last day that her mother would see her alive, and Daria
didn't want to her spend it cross.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>That wasn't the kind of final moments she wished to have with any of her
family, and she didn't want Helen to feel guilty afterwards.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She levered herself up off the bed, and
set off to answer the door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From the looks of her mother as she opened the door, the
chance of Helen getting out of this with a cool head was pretty slim.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her face was red, partially from
exertion, but also, Daria thought, from pure anger.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Helen didn't give her a chance to speak; as soon as they
made eye contact, she started in on her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria Marie Morgendorffer," she exclaimed, and Daria knew
that this would have a bad ending, "what the hell have you been doing the past
few days?!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Where have you
been?!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've called and called over
here and never gotten an answer; I drove over and your car was gone, every
time!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You disappeared for almost a
week; do you know how scared I was?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And then, finally, we got out of Quinn that you had gone to <i>Baltimore</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>?!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What
the hell possessed you to do that, without even telling us?"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria had no chance to interject
anything into her mother's tirade, but when Helen reached out to take Daria's
arm she shook it off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Young lady," Helen continued in righteous anger, "you are
coming home this instant, and I assure you Family Court will not look favorably
on you trying to get out of it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Mother," Daria finally managed to get in, "I <i>can't</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> leave Jane right now.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I promise, I'll be home in a couple of hours, but right now
I have to stay."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You do not get to plea bargain here," Helen replied.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I know you think that you're
independent, now that you've graduated high school and are off to college soon,
but as long as you live in my house you'll obey my rules, and my rules say to
come home with me <i>now</i><span style='font-style:normal'>."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She reached out once again to take her
arm, and Daria stepped back further into the house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, mother," she said as calmly as she could.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She couldn't believe that her last day
with her loved ones was starting so badly, and every second she was away from
Jane felt like an eternity during which anything could happen; she had to fight
down a rising sense of panic, of everything spinning out of control.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I'm sorry, I really am; I don't want
us to fight like this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I made
a promise to Jane, and I can't leave yet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But I swear I will come home as soon as I can, and I will take whatever
punishment you give me without reply.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But, please, don't force me to come with you."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Helen's anger seemed to recede slightly as she heard what
Daria was saying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Why can't you leave yet?" she asked, the heat still there
but tempered with a measure of curiosity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"What's wrong with Jane?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Why does she have to have you around right now?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I can't say," Daria replied.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She wished she could tell her mother everything, pour it all
out to her and ask for support and comfort for all of them; but Helen couldn't
know what was really happening, not and remain safe.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She'd try to stop Samara and possibly be driven insane, or
demand to see the tape herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>(At the back of her mind, Daria wondered if Trent had actually destroyed
the tape as he had promised, but she couldn't afford to dwell on that issue
right at this moment.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
obvious that her simple and uninformative reply did not improve Helen's mood,
but she made no further move to physically budge her daughter.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After a long, tense moment, Helen spoke
again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Fine," she said briskly, and gave a short nod of her
head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"You can stay, for now, but
I want you home by noon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Do you
understand?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria nodded and gave
her word, and Helen strode back to her car and drove away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria closed the door with a sigh, and leaned against it for
just one moment, grateful to have finally seen one thing in this terrible week
go her way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then, from Jane's room, she heard it: a piercing,
blood-curdling scream, the sound of pure terror.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It pierced her ears and reverberated through her brain and
her bones, turning her heart to ice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>For a moment, she was frozen in horror, then her legs were moving
towards the sound, no real thought in her mind other than that Jane needed her,
and the horrifying feeling that she was too late.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She dashed through Jane's door, almost falling headfirst in
her haste.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then she stopped; at
first glance, everything looked normal, exactly as she left it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She saw Jane lying on the bed, face
pointed the opposite direction; she looked like she was merely resting, with no
signs of terror or any kind of struggle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria wondered if maybe, somehow, through all the stress, she had
imagined the whole thing; if maybe Jane had finally just succumbed to
fatigue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She walked over to the
reclining form; her boots splashed through a puddle of water on the floor, but
she didn't even notice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She took
hold of Jane's shoulder and rolled her over to see if she was okay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And Daria saw Jane's face; she saw what had been her
face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now it was horribly
disfigured, green and bloated, the skin hanging off the skull like it was already
rotten.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her hand jerked back of
its own accord, her conscious mind shut down; wanting to close her eyes and
refuse all that she had seen, but feeling them open ever wider in shock and
horror, Daria backed away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her
whole body was seized with an icy grip, her arms and legs vibrating with the
instinct to flee as far away as they could; her heart felt constricted, and she
couldn't breathe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then her vision clouded over, and she knew no more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria regained consciousness wet and with a sore head.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was lying in a pool of water, and
using her hand to probe the back of her skull she found a painful lump; she
must have hit her head on the floor when she blacked out.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Damn, what time is it?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How long have I been unconscious?</i><span
style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Opening
her eyes to see Jane's ceiling above her, at first she wasn't sure of what had
happened, why she would be lying out cold in Jane's room.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then memory came flooding back to her,
and in shock she bolted upright, which her head immediately protested.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She barely noticed, for the first sight
that met her eyes was Jane's ravaged face; she rapidly averted her gaze, and
felt like she was going to be sick.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></span><i>Jane.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Oh, god,
Jane . . .</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Then she </span><i>was</i><span style='font-style:normal'>
sick, but when it was over and her stomach was empty, it still did not compare
to the void that was her heart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She wanted to stay here, to slowly absorb what had happened and grieve
for her friend, to guard her body until she was ready to let her go; but the
clock on the wall said that it was past four in the afternoon.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>That means I've got about an
hour, maybe less.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I can't stay
here; I've got to get home.</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Keeping her eyes on the door, she stood
up and slowly walked out of the room, still a bit unsteady on her feet.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When she reached the door, she paused.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>Farewell for now, my
friend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't know where you
are, but wherever it is, I'll be joining you soon.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The rest of the house was empty; either Trent had not yet
returned from the gig, or he had already come and left again, without knowing
what had happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria knew that
there was one more thing she had to do before she left; she called 911 and
anonymously reported a death on Howard Drive.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>All she could do now was hope that the paramedics arrived
before Trent did; she didn't want him to remember his sister like <i>that</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Then
she left for home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When she stepped into the Morgendorffer house, the first
thing she saw was her mother, standing in the den with her arms folded,
furious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria had been expecting
this, but that didn't make it any easier; she didn't want to fight, and she
knew her mother would regret it later, but she could see no way out of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You gave me your word, Daria," Helen began, her voice hard,
"and I trusted you, because I've never known you to go back on a promise.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But you're over four hours late, on top
of going missing for almost a week, and I don't know what's come over you.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Family Court will meet later to discuss
judgment, but I think it's safe to say that you will be grounded for a very
long time, and don't even think that you can bore us out of it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But for now, I want you to go to your
room and stay there until supper."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She pointed up the stairs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Supper would be around six or seven; Daria knew that she
wouldn't make it that long.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria
wanted to beg for a reprieve, to ask for the chance to spend her final precious
minutes in the company of her family, but she knew that the situation was too
far gone for that; her mother would never listen.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But she couldn't let those words be the last exchanged between
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I love you, mom," she said calmly, masking an overflowing
heart, and then walked up the stairs to her room, not waiting to see Helen's
reaction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As she walked up the
stairs, she heard sirens in the distance; her 911 call was bearing fruit.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She hated to think that soon the sirens
would be coming much closer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Inside her room, she looked around, examining the place
where she had spent so much of the past three years.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The padded walls, the barred windows, the broken TV bolted
to the ceiling, the door with the insane poetry -- these were all reminders of
the former occupant, these were the marks she had left on the space that had
been hers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>But what have I
left?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Once my things are packed
away to storage, what will remain to let people know I was ever here?</i><span
style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Determined to leave some concrete evidence of her own existence, she
took a key out of her pocket, and scratched on the wall the first lines that
came to her head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once she was finished, she examined what she had
written.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Is that my work?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is it Samara's?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is it some blend of the two?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Whichever it is, I like it; I think it
sums up what I'm feeling right now pretty well.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal>It was that moment that Quinn chose to burst into the room,
nervous and contrite.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, Daria," she began in rapid-fire speech, "I'm so sorry
about telling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I didn't mean to, I
swear I didn't, but Mom and Dad were all on me to tell them if I knew where you
had gone and it was like the Spanish Intermission and I finally just couldn't
take it anymore and I hope you don't want to hurt me and . . . gah, what are
you doing?!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quinn's train of
thought was derailed at the completely unexpected sensation of being wrapped in
a firm embrace by her sister.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria knew she didn't have much time left, and didn't think that Quinn
would give her the chance to verbally express her feelings, so she took the one
formerly-unthinkable avenue left to her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Quinn was frozen in surprise for an instant, then started to
squirm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Daria, what's wrong with
you?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Are you trying to scare
me?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is this some kind of weird,
geeky revenge?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ewww!"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She finally wriggled free and ran out
of the door, leaving Daria alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>I'm not going to get the chance to say a proper goodbye
to any member of my family, anyone I care about.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But I can't just leave them without letting them know how I
feel; I've spent my life too isolated to just assume they know.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And I want them to know how I died,

style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not
that there were many ways to commit suicide that would leave a corpse like the
one Jane did or Daria very soon would . . . she cut off that train of thought,
not wanting to be reminded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then,
she realized what she had to do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sitting at her desk, she picked up a pen and a sheet of paper.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The written word was her chosen medium,
her greatest talent; it was only appropriate that her final message to the
world be conveyed through it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
would tell Jake, Helen, and Quinn all that they had meant to her, individually
and together, and how much she valued them, even though it had not often seemed
that way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She would tell them all
that had happened in the past week, and warn them to avoid the tape at all
costs, no matter what steps they had to take to do it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She would let them know that she was,
not exactly happy, but proud to sacrifice her own life to stand in the way of
such an evil, and there was no better end to her life that she could have asked
for, even if it was coming too soon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She set to work with greater passion than she had ever possessed before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>BALTIMORE, MD (AP)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The investigation continues into the deaths of Daria Morgendorffer and
Jane Lane, both 17, of Lawndale, MD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The two teenage girls were found dead in their homes last Monday, of
still unknown causes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The time of
death for Jane Lane is approximated at 10:30 AM, and for Daria Morgendorffer at
5:00 PM.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The cause of death was
initially diagnosed as cardiac arrest, but this diagnosis has been rescinded
due to the presence of additional symptoms that do not fit this
conclusion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Their deaths are now
tentatively believed to be the result of an unknown biological agent; symptoms
include interruption of cardiac activity and rapid necrosis of the skin,
especially that of the face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Documents left behind by Miss Morgendorffer also suggest the onset of
dementia and hallucinations prior to death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To combat the possible spread of contagion, both the
Morgendorffer and Lane houses have been declared off-limits by the CDC, and the
Morgendorffer and Lane families have been placed into quarantine under Level 3
biohazard conditions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because the
two girls were known to have spent several days in Baltimore prior to their
deaths, where Daniel Corbett, 37, recently died of what are now believed to be
similar symptoms, additional quarantine measures are being considered for the
city and the surrounding suburbs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Inhabitants of these areas are advised to stay in their homes and limit
contact with others; visitors are discouraged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Experts are considering this incident as a possible case of
bio-terrorism; however, citizens are urged to remain calm and not spread rumors
that could lead to a panic situation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Other rumors that this condition is not biological but supernatural in
origin and spread by a cursed videotape are considered harmful to the public
health, and the CDC is asking anyone who hears such rumors to disregard them
and continue to abide by the health regulations that have been set up.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2>&quot;The police say it's a new kind of terrorism, but
we'll talk to a man who says that Baltimore syndrome is something far more
sinister. See the tape and decide for yourself! When video vixens kill, next on
