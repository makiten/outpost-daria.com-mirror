<br>
"You said that <i>already.</i>"<br>
<br>
Jake Morgendorffer looked up at the rear-view mirror to get a glimpse of his
eldest daughter. "Say what, kiddo?"<br>
<br>
"About moving to a new town," Daria Morgendorffer said, a touch annoyed. "I'm
not deaf."<br>
<br>
"Dad &ndash; is Daria going to start acting weird as soon as we get out of the car,
because, like, that could totally ruin any rep I could have with all the new
kids here!"<br>
<br>
Daria frowned as she turned to face a full head of bouncy, carrot-colored hair.
<i>Wish I had a frying pan, right now &ndash; and a wider space to swing it in.</i><br>
<br>
Quinn Morgendorffer rolled her eyes as Jake kept talking "Girls, I just want
you to know your mother and I realize it's not easy moving to a whole new town
-- especially for you, Daria, right?"<br>
<br>
"Did we move?"<br>
<br>
The words had barely left her mouth before Daria felt the strangest sense of
d&eacute;j&agrave; vu she had ever encountered. <i>What the hell just happened?</i><br>
<br>
The gentle thread of unease in Jake's voice came through, even with his effort
to laugh it off.<br>
<br>
"I'm just saying you don't make friends as easily as... uh, some people."<br>
<br>
Even the way Quinn leaned forward to turn the radio up only added to the sense
of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu Daria felt. <i>This is... weird.</i> <br>
<br>
"Quinn, for instance?"<br>
<br>
"That's not what I meant... necessarily." Even the way Jake turned the radio
off added to Daria's growing sense of unease. "The point is, the first day at a
new school is bound to be difficult..."<br>
<br>
It felt as if something inside her compelled her to lean forward, turn up the
radio, and shout out "Speak up, Dad! Can't hear you!" <br>
<br>
Jake turned the wheel as the car went around a corner, and turned off the radio
as he pulled up to a curb &ndash; <i>chauffered to the prison I've been remanded to
for the next three years,</i> Daria thought. <i>Oh, joy.</i><br>
<br>
"Uh, where was I?" Jake continued. "Oh, yeah... don't get upset if it takes the
other kids a little while to warm up to you."<br>
<br>
Daria shook her head as &ndash; just outside the car &ndash; she heard Quinn and 'some of
the natives' in conversation:<br>
<br>
<i>"Hi! You're cool. What's your name?"<br>
<br>
"Quinn Morgendorffer." <br>
<br>
"Cool name."<br>
<br>
"Will you go out with me?"</i><br>
<br>
She blinked hard. <i>Now, that's just too weird &ndash; even for being me.</i><br>
<br>
"See you later, Dad."<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Daria lay back on her bed, staring up at the television set bolted to the ceiling.
And that's just the least strange thing I've seen today.<br>
<br>
<i>Today had to be the <u>worst</u> case of having flashbacks, or
flash-forwards, or flash-three-spaces-up&ndash;and-two-overs that I've ever <u>heard</u>
of. Maybe the brown acid that Dad took from that other hippie guy finally
seeped out of my DNA and into something of mine that's making a difference &ndash; or
maybe I'm getting alien powers.</i><br>
<br>
Her mind drifted back to that weird kid that she had seen at the UFO convention
the day before &ndash; <i>or <u>something</u>,</i> she thought. <i>Hey, Artie? Better
watch out. I may decide to take <u>you</u> off in my flying saucer to serve me
as I tan on Mount Olympus across from the parking lot with Apollo's chariot,
and <u>your skin</u> down in my mole-machine to my imperial underground
nut-mines, so it can command my legions of squirrels as they dig for their
supper.</i><br>
<br>
<i>Okay. That was <u>too</u> sarcastic &ndash; even for me. Eloi Body and Morlock
skin &ndash; yuck.</i> <br>
<br>
A tiny smile went across her face. <i>Eloi body - and <u>Morlock</u> brain.
Hey. That sounds like my sister.</i><br>
<br>
She reached over to pick up the cordless phone she had taken from downstairs &ndash;
over Quinn's wailing protests &ndash; and dialed a number. <i>Maybe I'll give Jane a
laugh about this. It has Sick, Sad World written all over it.</i><br>
<br>
A sliver of worry poked Daria as she heard Jane Lane's voice on the other end
of the connection. <i>"Hello? Who's calling?"</i><br>
<br>
"Hi, Jane. It's me. Daria."<br>
<br>
The voice suddenly took on a guarded tone.<i>"Daria <u>who</u>?"</i><br>
<br>
Daria drew back to stare at the phone, before placing it back to her ear. "Ha,
ha. That's funny. It's me."<br>
<br>
The voice got noticeably cooler. <i>"Look, whoever this is &ndash; trying to get all
chummy with me isn't going to work. I don't care what you think we owe you &ndash; <u>I
know the law</u>! I'm asking you to stop calling! The law says that you can
only contact us through the mail! Goodbye!"</i><br>
<br>
The way Jane had spoken so rattled Daria that she didn't even notice Quinn
enter her room. "Daria &ndash; other people need to actually use the phone," the
perky redhead huffed, tapping her right foot at a fast tempo. "Can we have it
back, please?"<br>
<br>
"Yeah. I guess." Daria sat up on her bed, and tossed the phone without looking.<br>
<br>
Quinn had to dash to catch the phone before it would have landed neatly in the
small wastepaper basket next to Daria's desk. <br>
<br>
"You know," Quinn said, looking down her adorable nose at her sister as she
cradled the phone like a lost child returned home, "It's very sad when people
have to pretend to have friends and tie up the phone when people who actually <u>have</u>
friends and actually <u>need</u> to call them <u>can't</u> because of lonely,
confused and sad people..."<br>
<br>
Daria shot her sister a cross look. "I have a friend."<br>
<br>
The bubbling laugh flowed through the room, annoying Daria even more. <i>"<u>You</u>?</i>
Make <u>a friend</u> - let alone, <i>on <u>the first day</u> of school?</i>
Like <u>that'll</u> ever happen anywhere except on that weird show about weird
stuff happening in the place where the bones glow just before sunset, or
something?"<br>
<br>
It was all Daria could do to keep from burying her face in her hands &ndash; <i>or
better, Quinn's face in my pillow.</i> "It's <i>'The Twilight <u>Zone</u>',</i>
Quinn. '<i><u>Zone</u></i>'. Learn to use it in a sentence." <br>
<br>
The tiny, adorable nose crinkled in a way that made Daria want to hit it as
Quinn took a look around her sister's room. "Ew. Even your room is weird."<br>
<br>
She turned around, but then, glanced back. "Or, should I say <i>'Even your room
is a weird <u>zone</u>'."</i><br>
<br>
"Whatever," Daria snipped off, as the door to her room closed behind Quinn.
"I'll just ask Jane tomorrow why the hell did she act like she didn't know me."<br>
<br>
She laid back down on her bed, adjusting the pillow as she did so. <i>Tomorrow,
the weirdness &ndash; or whatever I accidentally ate or drank &ndash; will be gone. All I
need... is just a good night's sleep.</i><br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
The next day, as Daria walked through the crowd in the Lawndale High hallway,
students oblivious to her presence, she knew that something was seriously
wrong. <br>
<br>
"S.O.S.," she said, to no one in particular. "Girl <i><u>definitely</u></i>
overboard."<br>
<br>
