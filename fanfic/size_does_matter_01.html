 herself as she watched the town pass by from the
 backseat of her father&#8217;s Lexus.
 <!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >Sitting behind her father who navigated the
 unfamiliar streets of Lawndale she had a clear view
 at her sister to her right side, who had moved the
 passenger seat to its ultimate backward position.
 Watching Quinn&#8217;s lost-in-thought posture she
 knew that her sister had similar mixed feelings
 about the things to come.

<span 
class="ecti-1095">Well, must come with the cold winter. You</span>
<span

<span

<!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >Daria mentally groaned at her unintended pun.
While being 16 months Quinn&#8217;s senior, she wasn&#8217;t
the &#8216;big sister&#8217;. At 6&#8217;4" Quinn was, and so Daria
voluntarily surrendered the additional legroom
offered by the passenger seat to her.

<span 
class="ecti-1095">behind Quinn.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 48--><p class="noindent" >&#8216;Short&#8217; wasn&#8217;t an attribute one would use for any
of the Morgendorffer sisters. At 6&#8217;3" Daria stood
quite tall herself.

<!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >Jake was well aware of the girl&#8217;s trepidation, and
came to the conclusion that they were given
enough time to brood.
<!--l. 57--><p class="noindent" >He decided to interrupt the non-conversation that
to some extend was covered up by the radio that
Quinn had turned on immediately after they left
their new home.

opportunity. People&#8217;ll know you just the way you
are right now. Blend in a little. Please?&#8221;
<!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Daria comes first. Again. I know you do not</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">mean to, but... I know you love me, but you and</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">Daria share something that I&#8217;ll never be a part of.</span>&#187;

 <!--l. 89--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span

 in, pick up class schedule, get tour. The rest -
 we&#8217;ll see. God, I hope they have decent sized
 furniture and not that old stuff that was designed
 considering the &#8217;60s average height....1860s&#8221; Daria
 said with a smirk provoking a chuckle from Jake
 and Quinn.

 <!--l. 105--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Unless they are blind.</span>&#187; Quinn and Daria thought
 in unison.
 <!--l. 107--><p class="noindent" >After a minute of silence, Daria offered her father
 &#8220;Bet you 10 I&#8217;ll be mistaken for a guy at least 5
 times today.&#8221;

it.
<!--l. 113--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Deal. Bet you 2 times max. Closest wins.&#8221; Jake

him to seal the deal.

class="ecti-1095">you know she hates being lied to. At least it&#8217;s a</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">good time for her to meet new people. I checked</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">that this morning.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 122--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Done. Remember, cash, or I&#8217;ll sick my goons on
you.&#8221;
<!--l. 125--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span

<span 
class="ecti-1095">would think if they overheard you say stuff like</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">that?</span>&#187;
<!--l. 127--><p class="noindent" >Quinn leaned her head on the window. Daria
wondered about the uneasy expression on her
sister&#8217;s face.
<!--l. 133--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">What&#8217;s it with Quinn&#8217;s mood? It&#8217;s going to be</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">&#8216;vene vidi vici&#8217; and all boys up to the seniors will</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">worship her. OK, the girls are likely to hate her to</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">the same degree, but she managed to placate &#8217;em</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">in Junior High, so what?</span>&#187;
<!--l. 138--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Girls, remember, your Mom and I have to get
settled in at our new jobs today. If we&#8217;re not back
on time, take care of yourselves. The kitchen&#8217;s
unpacked and we did our initial grocery shopping,
so just cook whatever you like.&#8221;
<!--l. 140--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Can I take a detour on the way back to see the
neighborhood?&#8221; Quinn asked, and Jake&#8217;s answer
was quick.
<!--l. 144--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No Quinn, come home straight on the first day.
We&#8217;ll have a lot things to talk about. You can
look around later.&#8221;
<!--l. 146--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;So, you and mom going to be home or not?&#8221;
Daria demanded slightly irritated.
<!--l. 151--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to get home early, but no promises.
Just go home straight. Ah, look girls, that&#8217;s your
new school, right there. Doesn&#8217;t look it nice and
welcoming?&#8221;
<!--l. 153--><p class="noindent" >They rode the last minute in silence and took the
location in. Sport fields bordered on the street
well before they approached the simple, but on  the first impression well kept buildings. A drop-off
 circle with a sign announcing &#8220;Lawndale High&#8221;
 was next to the main entrance, and a parking lot
 continued the school&#8217;s front on the other side of
 the buildings.
 <!--l. 159--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Convenient.</span>&#187; Daria thought, &#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Very few students</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">mill around the school area. The locals time their</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">arrival at school with much less leeway than we</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">newbies. Maybe we won&#8217;t immediately draw</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">attention.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 163--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Here goes nothing</span>&#187; both girls thought as Jake
 pulled into the drop-off circle and stopped the
 Lexus.
 <!--l. 167--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Have a good day, girls. Mom and I&#8217;ll be thinking
 of you. Love you both!&#8221; Jake said as he petted
 Quinn&#8217;s head.
 <!--l. 169--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">It messes my hair a little, but ...</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 171--><p class="noindent" >With a &#8220;love you too&#8221; Quinn was out of the car
 and strode her trademark big steps towards the
 main doors, while Jake and Daria watched the
 students&#8217; reactions. A group of three girls eyed
 Quinn and immediately intensified the chatter
 among them.
 <!--l. 178--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;As expected. They have a &#8216;The new secretary is
 pretty young and damn cute&#8217;-look all over.
 Haven&#8217;t spotted a single guy in the vicinity that
 did not stare at her until she vanished inside. You
 dad?&#8221;
 <!--l. 180--><p class="noindent" >Jake did not answer immediately, but turned a
 little bit as Daria opened the door. He was as
 uneasy as the girls.
 <!--l. 183--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Look after Quinn, Daria. She needs you more
 than she lets on.&#8221;
 <!--l. 185--><p class="noindent" >The car&#8217;s suspension adjusted again as another
 passenger got out.
 <!--l. 188--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Dad, you know I&#8217;m not convinced of that. She
 handles herself pretty well. It wasn&#8217;t her who
 was...&#8221;
 <!--l. 190--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Just do it.&#8221; Jake cut Daria off. He looked at her
 in the eyes, she nodded and closed the car&#8217;s door
 without another word.
 <!--l. 194--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Daria, you&#8217;ve really a blind spot for Quinn. At</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">least I don&#8217;t have to worry about guys trying to</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">force you to do anything.</span>&#187; Jake thought as he
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
rode off to his office to prepare for his first
client in Lawndale. The appointment was for 10
o&#8217;clock.

<!--l. 200--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;..and her legs go on, like, forever!&#8221;
<!--l. 202--><p class="noindent" >Sandi Griffin, President of the Lawndale High
Fashion Club was clearly impressed with the
woman that just slipped through the main doors
and headed to the offices.
<!--l. 207--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;If she&#8217;s a new secretary, the guys&#8217;ll start fights
just to be sent to the office to see her!&#8221; giggled
Stacy.
<!--l. 209--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;She is so tall,...&#8221; Tiffany started, and in order to
finish the conversation before the sound of the
tardy bell Stacy chimed in.
<!--l. 212--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;6&#8217;3" at least...and that walk! She must be a
model!&#8221; .
<!--l. 214--><p class="noindent" >Sandi sensed trouble and immediately went to
work in order to get her sycophants back in
line.
<!--l. 219--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Puhleaze! If she&#8217;d be model, why should she be
working as a secretary? And besides that, we
didn&#8217;t see her up close. I&#8217;m sure her face is not
nearly as cute as mine. Or any of yours. Maybe
she has a really bad case of acne...&#8221;
<!--l. 221--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;EWWW&#8221;
<!--l. 224--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Oh my god, Sandi, did you see her clothes? They
were so last month. Or at least three weeks old.
You&#8217;re right Sandi, she can&#8217;t be a model. No
way.&#8221;
<!--l. 228--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Exactly Stacy. A model that is not up-to-date in
fashion is like an ox-moron, aeh, forbids itself.
That tallness is so totally wasted on someone like
her.&#8221;
<!--l. 231--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;So did you see the announcement for the spring
fashion preview posted at Cashman&#8217;s ...&#8221;
<!--l. 233--><p class="noindent" >Stacy brought the pre-school fashion club meeting
back on schedule, only to be interrupted shortly
after.
<!--l. 236--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Whooooaaaa&#8221; said Tiffany, her drawl adding tothe sound&#8217;s graveness.
 <!--l. 238--><p class="noindent" >Following her gaze Sandi and Stacy got a glimpse
 at back of another person heading into the school
 towards the office.
 <!--l. 241--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Did you see his shoulders?&#8221; Tiffany drawled into
 the subsequent silence. That was a view to her
 liking.
 <!--l. 247--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Very impressive. And he was quite tall as well.
 I&#8217;d be able to recall if there was someone like him
 at Lawndale High. Must be a transfer student.
 Likely a football player. Do we need a temporary
 replacement for the quarterback - again?&#8221; Sandi
 stated, fearing that she missed some important
 gossip.
 <!--l. 251--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;The cheerleaders were not talking about anything
 like that when I overheard them yesterday,
 Sandi.&#8221; Stacy reassured Sandi. &#8220;Did you see that
 nice wavy brown hair fixed in a pony tail. It looks
 so ... rebellious.&#8221;
 <!--l. 258--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Of course I noticed, but did <span 
class="ecbx-1095">you </span>notice that ugly
 army jacket he was wearing? A total fashion-don&#8217;t.
 Let&#8217;s hope he gets his letter-jacket quick and
 starts wearing it, otherwise his popularity is
 sooooo going to drop.&#8221; Sandi took the offense.
 <!--l. 260--><p class="noindent" >The discussion of the new arrival&#8217;s dateability
 took precedence over the planned fashion club pre
 school meeting schedule, continued during the
 girls&#8217; walk to the classroom, and was brought to
 an end as the teacher interrupted the girls by
 starting their class.

 are!&#8221;
 <!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;...your brother?&#8221; was the only thing the secretary

<span 
class="ecti-1095">These things hurt her.</span>&#187;

proceed, Daria decided to press on.

I consider us signed in. The brochure says
you&#8217;re supposed to hand us our class schedules
next.&#8221;

started to go through a file muttering &#8220;M..M...Morgen...

<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent" >The secretary did a double-take at this, but
handed Daria her schedule after verifying the
names&#8217; spelling on the records. She froze as she
glanced at Quinn&#8217;s schedule while handing it to
her.
<!--l. 43--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span

<!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You are 14 years old?&#8221; - &#8220;14 and 8 months!&#8221;
Quinn answered with a radiant smile while prying
the schedule from the secretary&#8217;s hand.
<!--l. 55--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Ah. Ah. OK. Hm. Please wait next door for the
other new students to arrive, you&#8217;ll get the tour
then.&#8221;
<!--l. 57--><p class="noindent" >Quinn instinctively ducked under the doorframe
into an empty waiting area, and Daria closed the
door to the office happy that she at least was able
to walk upright through regular doors. Before the
door closed, they heard the secretary mutter to
herself &#8220;I need a drink!&#8221;.                      <!--l. 62--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;That was fun!&#8221; stated Quinn.

 students emerged the office into the waiting
 area.
 <!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" >A rather short girl with her hair dyed red,
 wearing a black jacket and an ankh pendant. A
 short guy in a blue sweater with glasses, a short
 guy wearing incredible baggy pants and a medium

 white blouse under a blue cardigan. They sat in
 silence and eyed each other warily.

from above.

 an early lunch while I take care of something. I&#8217;ll

 Navigating the crowd was easy, as it parted
 in front of Ms. Li as the red sea in front of

<!--l. 182--><p class="noindent" >Jane Lane was having a bad day. Usually this
being a Monday would have been sufficient to
qualify for a bad day, but the third Monday of her
sophomore year was exceptionally bad. She had
overslept as she had pulled some crazy hours on
her latest art project, only to have her sleep
interrupted by her brother&#8217;s drunken bandmates
that carried their gear from their van into the
Lane basement. At least they had tried to. Jane
hadn&#8217;t dared to ask who of them had driven the
van from the club to the house, as all band
members had been too intoxicated to walk - let
alone to drive.
<!--l. 191--><p class="noindent" >Only a triple expresso strong enough to pose a
threat to the inox sugar spoon and her running
capabilities had let her arrive at homeroom just
before the tardy bell rang - saving her from an
hour of detention. Mr. DeMartino had eyed her
disapprovingly, but hadn&#8217;t commented on it.
Luckily she knew enough about Mexican history
from her sister Penny&#8217;s tales in order to somehow
wing the predictable grilling Mr. D gave her
even without doing the assigned reading. In
any other class she would have been sleeping
already, but Mr. D kept his students on the edge.
Today, Kevin seemed a little bit hung over,
and so Mr. D took delight in talking rather
loudly at him to provide Kevin&#8217;s headache
with an opportunity to unfold to its maximum
extent.
<!--l. 202--><p class="noindent" >Second period was economics with Ms. Bennet.
Jane tried to make out the hidden meaning in
her diagrams to avoid nodding off, but she
came up empty - and she usually could see
the meaning of a painting done by Dali on
acid.
<!--l. 206--><p class="noindent" >On her way to her third period - math - she
spotted a group of students down the hallway
being led towards the cafeteria by Ms. Li.
<!--l. 214--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">New cannon fodder. Welcome to the third circle</span>
<span

class="ecti-1095">That tall, must be seniors. The girl is going to</span>
 <span

 <span

 <span 
class="ecti-1095">Yummy. Has a smooth walk, must do some sports.</span>
 <span

 <span 
class="ecti-1095">known amenities.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 216--><p class="noindent" >Math class passed much faster than usual for
 Jane, as she replayed the procession towards the
 cafeteria before her minds eye and did some
 quick sketches. She realized that those people
 must have been even taller than she initially
 estimated once she took the top line of the
 lockers into account. And that his clothing
 didn&#8217;t exactly fit the in-crowd. Maybe he was
 more than eye candy. Maybe she would get a
 chance.

than we are. Thank God I don&#8217;t look as old as I
feel.&#8221;
<!--l. 300--><p class="noindent" >Daria&#8217;s answer provoked a chuckle from the

<!--l. 305--><p class="noindent" >Every one picked up some food, and started to
settle down at a convenient table next to the
checkout counter.
<!--l. 308--><p class="noindent" >Years of experience told the ladies operating the
food counter that Daria and Quinn would not
appreciate a normal serving, even when Quinn  asked for a salad.
 <!--l. 311--><p class="noindent" >Quinn waited for Daria to pay, and Daria knew
 that Quinn would not let her sit on her own.
 <!--l. 314--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to eat all of that?&#8221;
 <!--l. 317--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No, I&#8217;m keeping half of it to put it on the
 compost heap I have in my locker&#8221; Daria said
 rolling her eyes before digging in. The food
 immediately assaulted her taste buds.
 <!--l. 321--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span

 slowly but systematically empty her tray.

 going.

 <!--l. 335--><p class="noindent" >Daria thought as she tuned the other students
 telling about their whereabouts and the perks
 Lawndale offered - or not - out. Quinn had
 cleverly steered the conversation away from the
 sibling&#8217;s size.
 <!--l. 339--><p class="noindent" >The general staring and gawking subsided as
 everyone was busy talking and eating. The others&#8217;
 meals weren&#8217;t better than Daria&#8217;s, and Quinn
 copiously complained about the salad.

 <!--l. 350--><p class="noindent" >Daria adjusted her glasses, nodded at her and
 continued with her dessert well after everybody
 else had finished their lunch. Quinn offered the
 girl an apologising look after she noticed the last
 part of their exchange.

<!--l. 364--><p class="noindent" >Jane eyed the selection at the lunchroom carefully.
As this was a Monday, there was no danger
of getting leftovers from the day before, but
coincidentally the available options were more
limited than the other days.

<!--l. 370--><p class="noindent" >Jane opted for a prepacked sandwich that was
thus safe for human consumption, and the coffee
with the free refill option. She would get some real
food for dinner, provided Trent did the grocery
shopping as he promised. Otherwise, she would
make him pick up some pizza to make it up to
her. The cafeteria&#8217;s coffee had the quality of
common dishwater, but 6 mugs would get her
through the afternoon.

 round table. Daria and Quinn had to struggle a
 little to find sufficient legroom.

 man and woman talking.
 <!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I called you in last so we would have more time

 talk about the things that you have in common
 with both of you saving everyone some time, and

 afterwards. OK?&#8221;

LHS received your old school records. And had a

smallest irregularity.&#8221;
<!--l. 68--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span

<!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >Daria barely contained a smirk. That was
something her mother was good at.

again and sighed.

girls.
<!--l. 86--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;My gut tells me that this is just a little too
normal for the two of you. So tell me about the
things that are not on record.&#8221;

even a little since she had sat down and looked
her straight in the eyes. Quinn&#8217;s eyes were
darting around the room every now and then.
After a short moment Daria leaned a little
forward, put her hands on her knees and spoke
up.

 <!--l. 106--><p class="noindent" >That did not go unnoticed by Ms. Manson, as well
 as the fact that Daria&#8217;s eyes never left her, even
 while the girl reassumed her previous pose.
 Exactly her previous pose.

 <!--l. 129--><p class="noindent" >Ms. Manson had noted that Daria&#8217;s eyes had
 gotten a little wider when she had brought out

Mom frequently works crazy hours, but makes

<br class="newline" />&#8220;I think we covered all topics that were suitable
for a combined session. Daria, I&#8217;d like you to step
outside and stay in the waiting area while I talk
to Quinn. I&#8217;ll call you in later. Quinn, you want a
cup of water from the cooler?&#8221;
<!--l. 183--><p class="noindent" >Ms. Manson got up and moved towards the
cooler, likely to get herself some water. Daria got
up, picked up her backpack and headed to the
door with well planned movements.
<!--l. 188--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span

 <!--l. 201--><p class="noindent" >Quinn felt very uncomfortable after Daria left the
 room and clung to the paper cup after she took a
 sip. She would have to be careful about some
 events.
 <!--l. 204--><p class="noindent" >Ms. Manson quickly drained her cup.
 <!--l. 207--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Well. Your sister is pretty close lipped. You seem
 to be much more communicative.&#8221;
 <!--l. 209--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span

 <span 
class="ecti-1095">Happy-go-lucky ...</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;I enjoy being around people, you know, sharing
 thoughts and such.&#8221;
 <!--l. 212--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span

 <br class="newline" />&#8220;So you like the attention coming with your
 height.&#8221;
 <!--l. 215--><p class="noindent" >That was something Quinn felt content about, she
 had to smiled a little.
 <!--l. 221--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yes, but I think my height is a little much. I
 can&#8217;t even wear platforms or heels, it just looks
 awful. And having only about three sets of
 clothes to choose from limits you so much.
 Getting any decent clothes in my size on a
 strict budget is sooo difficult. I&#8217;m so glad my
 growth is slowing down. Maybe I&#8217;ll get now
 what I&#8217;m missing in bust and hips to become
 perfect.&#8221;
 <!--l. 223--><p class="noindent" >Quinn made gestures at the mentioned parts of
 her body, moving her thin arms and fingers in
 graceful, flowing motions.
 <!--l. 227--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span

 <span

 <span 
class="ecti-1095">enough to be a model!</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;I understand that. But what about the attention?&#8221;
 <!--l. 232--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Well, it is really nice to have all the guys looking
 at you, talk to you, do stuff for you or buy you
 gifts. And I really enjoy my modelling job, I like
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
to teach people how to look perfect.&#8221;
<!--l. 235--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Someone really loves herself. And she already is</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">a model. Ask about that later.</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you afraid of some guys forcing themselves
unto you?&#8221;
<!--l. 238--><p class="noindent" >Quinn&#8217;s smile dropped a little. That was an
aspect that she preferred not to think too much
about. She glanced at her fingers before she
remembered Ms. Manson and continued carefully.
<!--l. 245--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Oh... No... Not really. I don&#8217;t date as much as I&#8217;d
like to, and mom keeps really tight taps on me.
Do you know how often I get that &#8216;No! You&#8217;re not
even 15 yet!&#8217;? She sets rather tight rules and
doesn&#8217;t let me date a boy whom she hasn&#8217;t
met before. And, of course, there&#8217;s the group
dynamics.&#8221;
<!--l. 247--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;What do you imply by &#8216;group dynamics&#8217;?&#8221;
<!--l. 254--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;What do you think would happen if I hint, say at
the football team, that some guy went rough on
me? And beside that, mom made me take some
self defence classes. I quit though, because all that
sweating is icky. And bodily contact with those
un-cute persons - ewwww. You didn&#8217;t even get to
wear a nice sport dress, and if you weren&#8217;t
really carefull, you got bruises! Bruises are so
unfashionable and could permanently harm my
complexion!&#8221;
<!--l. 258--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Oh. That&#8217;s smart - and devious... at least are</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">you are aware of the problem. Likes things</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">pristine. And that fashion-babble. Hmm, she didn&#8217;t</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">mention her sister as a possible protector. Time to</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">switch...</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Those classes are not mentioned on your school
records, so I take it that you attended some
external classes.&#8221;
<!--l. 262--><p class="noindent" >Quinn relaxed once the conversation had moved
on to another topic.
<!--l. 266--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;That&#8217;s right, mom primarily wanted herself to
attend the training and doing some bonding
by attending them together seemed to be an
additional benefit.&#8221;
<!--l. 268--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;&#8216;Together&#8217; would include your sister?&#8221;
<!--l. 270--><p class="noindent" >Quinn noted her slip and immediately became
alert; at least this did not concern her.         <!--l. 273--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Careful now, Quinn.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Yes, mom made both of us attend. Why would
 she bond with just one daughter if she could bond
 with both at the same time?&#8221;
 <!--l. 277--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Did your mother and your sister enjoy those
 classes?&#8221;
 <!--l. 279--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I think a little, but... they&#8217;re mom and Daria.&#8221;
 <!--l. 281--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;So, your interests differ from your sister&#8217;s?&#8221;
 <!--l. 283--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Of course. Daria&#8217;s interests are just weird.&#8221;
 <!--l. 285--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Good weird or bad weird? Ask later.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;So what are your interests, besides being around
 people?&#8221;
 <!--l. 288--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Full throttle now.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;I like cute things! Like, puppies, stuffed animals,
 those suede shoes I saw at the mall last week, and
 those clothes they had at the last photo shoot
 were just adorable. I like music as well, but
 only if it&#8217;s performed by nice looking guys and
 does not distract the peoples&#8217; attention from
 me.&#8221;
 <!--l. 294--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Your looks may deceive, but you&#8217;re 14, no</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">doubt.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;And what kind of activities do you like?&#8221;
 <!--l. 297--><p class="noindent" >Quinn began to talk animatedly, shifting in her
 chair.
 <!--l. 306--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Well, going to the mall to shop, I especially like
 browsing through the accessories department, there
 are so many accessories to chose from giving you
 so much combinations to look fashionable. And
 it&#8217;s really hard to avoid all those combinations
 that are unfashionable. You need constant
 updates to avoid fashion disasters. It&#8217;s like
 that live long learning thing. This is why I like
 watching fashion TV and read every Waif issue
 there is. And of course I like going to the movies,
 a nice restaurant or an amusement park with a
 guy. Or just hang out with my friends talking. I
 like people!&#8221;
 <!--l. 308--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">You mentioned that already. My head.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Well, ok. Did your size cause any health
 problems?&#8221;
 <!--l. 314--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Naa, I just have to do some regular exercises, like
 physiotherapy. &#8216;Your muscles need to keep up
 with your skeleton&#8217; the doctors said. I don&#8217;t like
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
them, they get me sweaty and are boring, but
mom and Daria are really on my back about
this.&#8221;
<!--l. 316--><p class="noindent" >Quinn&#8217;s gestures underlined her unhappiness with
that fact.
<!--l. 318--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a

<!--l. 320--><p class="noindent" >Daria grew nervous as time passed and Quinn was
in the hot seat. She was unsure how well Quinn
would control her blabbermouth. And what
kind of ammunition she would hand to the
shrink to use on her. Well, she couldn&#8217;t do
anything about that right now. Depending on the
consequences, she would have to talk to her mom
about that.
<!--l. 326--><p class="noindent" >The few magazines were halfway recent, but
gardening and sewing magazines were not exactly
to her interest. Or anybody else&#8217;s.
<!--l. 329--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span

<span

<!--l. 331--><p class="noindent" >Luckily she had packed a paperback into her
backpack that morning, as her textbooks would
be handed out by the individual teacher through
the course of the week.
<!--l. 336--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">They allow music players as long as nobody else</span>

<!--l. 338--><p class="noindent" >She fished the book out of her well-worn backpack,
and immersed herself in Frisch&#8217;s &#8216;Homo faber&#8217;.
She wasn&#8217;t sure whether Walter Faber should be
considered blessed or cursed.

<span

<br class="newline" />&#8220;OK I guess. She&#8217;s older, we have different
interests and move in different circles. We don&#8217;t mesh much.&#8221;
 <!--l. 351--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Even at home?&#8221;
 <!--l. 355--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yeah, Daria does her thing and I do my thing.
 You get good at ignoring each other if you grew
 up sharing a room. And Daria&#8217;s especially easy to
 ignore being busy reading and so.&#8221;

 slightly other means.&#8221;
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span

 Tell me a little about you father.&#8221;

 little in her seat.
 <!--l. 386--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s nice, really loves mom and us, runs a
 consultant business. He loves to cook but manages
 to wreck about every meal. Me and mom think
 he&#8217;s completely untalented at cooking, but don&#8217;t
 tell him. I think he has had a bad childhood, he
 frequently rants about Grandpa and his time at
 military school, but that got much better the last
 years.&#8221;
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Since he has a &#8216;son&#8217; of his own. And she does</span>

 home. So he&#8217;s around even while he&#8217;s working.
 He&#8217;s got call redirection and is trying to employ a

 <!--l. 556--><p class="noindent" >Quinn&#8217;s trip to the library was unspectacular.
 <!--l. 558--><p class="noindent" >She had ducked into the restroom that Ms.
 Manson pointed out to her, relieved herself and
 checked her appearance in one of the mirrors. The
 restroom didn&#8217;t differ much from the ones at her
 middle school in Highland. The whole school
 wasn&#8217;t much different, only slightly bigger.
 The students made a more sane impression as
 well.
 <!--l. 564--><p class="noindent" >Still, facing her first class at high school under the
 given circumstances made her uneasy. At least the
 presence of older kids made sure that the height
 difference was not as incredible as it has been in
 her final middle school year.
 <!--l. 569--><p class="noindent" >She looked at her face reflected by the mirror, and
 automatically started to make some minor
 corrections to her sparse makeup. The trip to the
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
psychologist with its uncertainties had made her
nervous. It took less than five minutes to make all
necessary corrections. After leaving the bathroom
she headed towards the library. Navigating the
empty hallways was easy, she remembered
the way to the library from the initial tour.
Only the faint voices of teachers and students
behind the class room doors permeated the
silence.
<!--l. 577--><p class="noindent" >After entering she presented the pass to the
librarian, who looked a little baffled at her, but
courtly nodded to keep the silence. She could hear
faint noises of one or two other visitors to the
library, but otherwise it was empty. After a
quick orientation Quinn headed to the easy
chairs in the periodicals section and took a
seat. Retrieving a map of Lawndale from her
backpack, she started to familiarize herself with
her new hometown. School. Home. Shortcut
through that park? Mall. Pool. Another mall.
Business district. City hall. City park. A gated
community. &#8216;Dega Street&#8217; had clubs. Eww - a
landfill.

she was beaten. The rest of the interview would
be rearguard action. But she relaxed a little. She
would not have to hide that much anymore. Or be
allowed to.
<!--l. 601--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;About three years ago I was a tiny, scrawny kid.
As tiny then as I&#8217;m big now. And then things got
really weird. I grew a little in height, but grew tits
and hips. One year later I look like one of these
blow-up dolls. Then my real growth spurt started
and I really got height and width. I looked like a
guy, no hips, and my breasts looked like nice pecs
with &#8216;unnatural&#8217; large nipples. From there, I
went to what I look now. 6&#8217;3" and about 190   pounds.&#8221;

 not as tight as before. &#8216;Not happy with herself&#8217;

 <!--l. 633--><p class="noindent" >She packed the map away, strolled towards the
 door and steeled herself. It was time to face her
 audience. She would try to handle things the
 way she tried and tested at middle school.
 Be nice. Be natural. Fit in. Try to ignore the
 gawking. Control and steer the guys. Placate and
 befriend the girls. Find a somewhat similar clique
 that made herself stand out less. Minimize the
 involvement in extra curricular activities to free
 time for her modelling job. That was fun work, an
 opportunity to see fashion before it was in the
 stores and maybe a career. At least a start for a
 career.

 she had learned that one of the students would be

<!--l. 731--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;There, done. Where&#8217;ll I be seated?&#8221;
<!--l. 733--><p class="noindent" >More students entered the room, most of them
taking a double take at Quinn who towered beside
Ms. Barch.
<!--l. 739--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">The unassigned seat in the center is not going to</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">work. No one behind her will be able to see</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">the chalkboard properly. Not that any of those</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">primitive dickheads is going to pay any attention</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">to the chalkboard if she&#8217;s in the line of sight.</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">Hmm...</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Ah, let me take a look at the seating plan. We&#8217;ll
have to make some changes. You&#8217;ll take the
seat in the back row to the right of the center
aisle.&#8221;
<!--l. 744--><p class="noindent" >She mentally redistributed the class&#8217; male students
to ensure that they had no opportunity to act on
their perverted thoughts during class.
<!--l. 747--><p class="noindent" >While Quinn walked towards her assigned seat,
she faced the class and observed their reaction.
All boys were looking silently at her, with
expressions from wonderment to intimidation.
The girls looked as well, but were whispering
among themselves. The boy whose seat she was to
occupy had a pleased grin on his face as she    approached him and he got a closer look at her.
 That grin, however, vanished as soon as he stood
 up and noticed that she was at least five inches
 taller than he was.
 <!--l. 755--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hey, you! Get away from the girl!&#8221;
 <!--l. 757--><p class="noindent" >Ms. Barch&#8217;s voice reminded him that he was
 treading dangerous ground. With a shrieking
 voice she started to orchestrate the permutation,
 and since the male students complied without
 complaining, she finished the procedure right with
 the start-of-class bell.
 <!--l. 762--><p class="noindent" >Next to Quinn sat a girl with with brown hair
 done in pigtails, who looked unbelieving at the
 new arrival.
 <!--l. 765--><p class="noindent" >Stacy was in an uproar. Intimidated. The women
 was not a model, she was not the new secretary,
 she was a new student. A freshman. She was
 sitting right beside her. And suddenly hundreds of
 little tiny dayglow arrows seemed to point at
 Stacy&#8217;s own imperfections. This news required
 an emergency meeting of the fashion club
 immediately after school, because her arrival
 would disturb the established pecking order to its
 core.
 <!--l. 774--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;OK. We&#8217;ve a new student among us. Her name is
 Quinn Morgendorffer, and she transferred in just
 today. Make her feel welcome at Lawndale High.
 And you males: eyes front!&#8221;
 <!--l. 776--><p class="noindent" >With those words Ms. Barch launched into
 her lecture on the electric field. Quinn took
 some notes, but carefully observed her class
 mates. Some girls were looking at her every now
 and then, and carefully whispering among
 themselves when Ms. Barch wasn&#8217;t looking.
 It was not hard to guess what would be the
 topic of their discussion. But no boys were
 stealing glances at her, or talking or exchanging
 notes.
 <!--l. 784--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Strange, let&#8217;s find out whats up with that...come</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">on, write something on the board. Now!</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m Quinn. What&#8217;s up with the boys?&#8221;
 <!--l. 787--><p class="noindent" >The girl to her left startled a little, got wide
 eyed, immediately looked straight ahead and
 ignored her while edging to the left side of her
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
seat to increase the distance between her and
Quinn.
<!--l. 791--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">That went really well.</span>&#187; Quinn thought dejectedly
before she redirected her attention at the lecture.

<!--l. 796--><p class="noindent" >The break passed too fast for Daria&#8217;s taste.
<!--l. 798--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Unless she starts the real poking now, that went</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">rather painless.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 800--><p class="noindent" >Daria drained her cup, got up and refilled it while
Ms. Mason scribbled away.
<!--l. 803--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">OK, Daria&#8217;s problem is with herself, not with the</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">others. And she&#8217;s a smartass.</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Let&#8217;s continue, Daria.&#8221;
<!--l. 806--><p class="noindent" >After Daria sat down, her pose was far less refined
than it had been for the first part of the session.
Ms. Manson took the lead again.
<!--l. 809--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I have some more questions, but I think they&#8217;ll
be much easier.&#8221;
<!--l. 811--><p class="noindent" >Daria felt mentally drained and just nodded.
<!--l. 813--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;How is your relationship to your parents?&#8221;
<!--l. 816--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Normal, I think. Mom&#8217;s ok but bugs me every
now and then, but I think that is in the job
description, and I get along well with dad.&#8221;
<!--l. 818--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Hmm, two alpha-females clashing a little?</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;How do you get along with Quinn?&#8221;
<!--l. 821--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Ok, I guess. Fine, as long as we ignore each
other.&#8221;
<!--l. 823--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;And if you don&#8217;t?&#8221;
<!--l. 826--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;We can get along, but I think our interests are
too different in order not to bore the other out of
her skull.&#8221;
<!--l. 828--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You think Quinn is boring?&#8221;
<!--l. 832--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Quinn&#8217;s interests are boring. Fashion, dating,
looking at cute things. With her modelling I see a
little benefit in her occupation with fashion, but
the rest... However, I think most people of our
generation are that way.&#8221;
<!--l. 834--><p class="noindent" >Daria made some fuzzy gestures. The relationship
to her sister was some of the few things that did
not cause problems. Ms Manson appended &#8216;Veryjudgemental&#8217; to her notes.
 <!--l. 838--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Quinn told me you took martial arts classes a
 while ago?&#8221;
 <!--l. 840--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Good. She didn&#8217;t get that right.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Yes, it was a little over three years ago.&#8221;
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">...that I started.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 844--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Quinn didn&#8217;t enjoy the physical training. How
 about you?&#8221;
 <!--l. 847--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Those classes really improved my body
 coordination. You know, fast growth.&#8221;
 <!--l. 849--><p class="noindent" >Daria gestured at her body and thought about the
 training&#8217;s additional benefits for her mental
 balance.
 <!--l. 852--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Oh, of course. You must be glad that you&#8217;re
 finally full grown.&#8221;
 <!--l. 854--><p class="noindent" >Daria nodded at Ms. Manson who looked at her
 over the rim of her glasses.
 <!--l. 856--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;That&#8217;s a given.&#8221;
 <!--l. 859--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;We haven&#8217;t covered your father. You say you get
 along with him, so what do you do?&#8221;
 <!--l. 862--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Mostly just hang out. Reading the newspaper.
 Cooking. Doing housework.&#8221;
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">And the fun things we did that made mom mad</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">at us. I enjoyed that as much as dad, no matter</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">what mom thought.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 866--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Anything else about your father?&#8221;
 <!--l. 868--><p class="noindent" >Daria shrugged, which seemed to fit her attitude.
 <!--l. 871--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;He has had a complicated childhood that he&#8217;s
 never going to forget, but he goes to great lengths
 to make sure our family life is healthy.&#8221;
 <!--l. 873--><p class="noindent" >Even if Daria never told it to her father she was
 really appreciating his efford.
 <!--l. 876--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s nice.&#8221;
 <!--l. 878--><p class="noindent" >Ms. Manson glanced at the clock, and then at the
 sparse notes she had taken.
 <!--l. 880--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">No severe contradictions to her sisters statements.</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">That will do.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;I think we can end the interview now, we
 covered all important bases. I&#8217;ll let you head out
 in a minute, but I think there is no point in
 sending you to class for the last 35 minutes of the
 day.&#8221;
 <!--l. 885--><p class="noindent" >Daria saw a silver lining at the horizon.
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
<!--l. 887--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Not bad. I can save the embarrassment for</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">tomorrow.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 889--><p class="noindent" >Ms. Manson filled in some form as she spoke.
<!--l. 892--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I think you&#8217;ll have few problems while attending
school here. However, ...&#8221;
<!--l. 894--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m so not going to like what&#8217;s next.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 896--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;...from what you told me it is obvious that you
have some issues.&#8221;
<br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Issues with authority, for example.</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;LHS offers a special class for students with
self-esteem and body image issues. It&#8217;s a four
week course an hour per day after school and you
will really profit from attending it.&#8221;
<br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">It will give you enough time to think of the way</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">you approach people - people like me.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 904--><p class="noindent" >The silver lining turned out to be an optical
illusion.
<!--l. 906--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Ah, crap.</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;This is not negotiable?&#8221;
<!--l. 909--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You have self-esteem issues that need to be
attended. No.&#8221;
<!--l. 911--><p class="noindent" >Ms. Manson took some notes and Daria tried to
come to terms with her predicament. Ms. Manson
started to explain while still writing.
<!--l. 917--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;The class&#8217; cycle starts today, so you&#8217;ll need to
stay in order to get it over with in a timely
fashion. Here&#8217;s a hall pass, you can head over to
the class room immediately and wait there for the
start of the class. Your book should last that 40
minutes.&#8221;
<!--l. 919--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">The &#8216;administration&#8217; card - maybe...</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;What about my parents?&#8221;
<!--l. 924--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;ll have the office inform your parents
immediately, and I will inform Mr. O&#8217;Neill
about your addition to the class roster. And I&#8217;ll
make sure your sister is informed and gets
home.&#8221;
<!--l. 926--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Last straw.</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;What happens if my parents object?&#8221;
<!--l. 930--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">You still don&#8217;t see who has more pull here, do</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">you. Well, I can arrange another cycle for you</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">later on...</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Considering that it&#8217;s for your benefit I doubt
they will once <span 
class="ecbx-1095">I </span>explained it to them.&#8221;         <!--l. 934--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;OK then.&#8221;
 <!--l. 936--><p class="noindent" >Daria&#8217;s small voice did not fit her large frame. She
 was not happy about getting an additional freak
 label stuck on to her, but being honest with
 herself she knew as well that she had still open
 issues. She would be the big freak anyway. Maybe
 it wouldn&#8217;t matter at all.
 <!--l. 943--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Here&#8217;s a hall pass to head for the class room. I
 trust you to wait there without supervision until
 the class starts. Don&#8217;t betray that. I&#8217;ll inform
 everybody.&#8221;
 <!--l. 945--><p class="noindent" >Daria accepted the paper and slid it into her
 backpack. She nodded at Ms. Manson and was
 not sure whether the trust was heartfelt or just a
 tactical maneuver to placate her. She got up as
 Ms. Manson&#8217;s shuffling of papers made clear that
 the session was finished.
 <!--l. 951--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Goodbye, Daria, and have a pleasant stay at
 LHS. And I want you to remember that it is my
 job to help students.&#8221;
 <!--l. 953--><p class="noindent" >Ms. Manson&#8217;s voice was saccharine.
 <!--l. 955--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Correct your attitude, or I&#8217;ll help you find some</span>
 <span

 <!--l. 957--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Goodbye, Ms. Manson.&#8221;
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Yes, and you really love your job. You just</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">love to wield your shrink powers over the</span>
 <span

 <span

 <!--l. 963--><p class="noindent" >Ms. Manson watched Daria leave the office.
 <!--l. 968--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">She&#8217;s smart, does not like authority. Need to keep</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">an eye on her. I would feel safer if she had</span>
 <span

outside, and felt more relieved than she would
have expected. The anger about the additional
freak label did not subside, but faded a little into
the background.
<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >She had memorized the room number, and as
LHS had a simple layout, locating the room was
no problem. On the way through the empty
hallways she stopped at a restroom she passed by
and relieved herself from the water she had drunk
during the interview. She checked herself in the
mirror above the sink, and decided to quickly
freshen her face.
<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >She just left the restroom and continued on her
way when somebody ran into her at a hallway
crossing. The scrawny guy with hair as red as her
sister&#8217;s and lots of freckles just bounced off of her
and fell to the floor.
<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Here.&#8221;
<br class="newline" />He took the hand Daria offered him, got up
without really looking at her and immediately
made a beeline towards the boys rest room.
<!--l. 31--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Dude, I&#8217;m sorry, but I really really gotta go.&#8221;
were his words before the restroom door closed
behind him.
<!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">That would be three, but he didn&#8217;t say it either.</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">Dad&#8217;s going to win this one. I just didn&#8217;t meet</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">enough people today. Maybe I can double the bet</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">for tomorrow - then I&#8217;ll win for sure.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 38--><p class="noindent" >Daria didn&#8217;t stall on her way to the class room,
and arrived shortly after at her destination. The
room wasn&#8217;t locked, so she entered, turn on the
lights, and took a chair in the center of the room.
She didn&#8217;t feel like reading, so she just put her
backpack on her desk, put her arms around it and
slumped over it, using it as a pillow to relax
until this class began. Some of her hairs got
stuck somewhere on her jacket, so she removed
the hair band holding her brown mane in its
small ponytail and used her hands to brush it
free.
<!--l. 46--><p class="noindent" >With her face shielded by her arms and her hair
from the ceiling lights she nodded a bit and
contemplated the day. It really nagged her to be
forced into this class. Her physique made her   enough of an outcast, she didn&#8217;t need her psyche
 to add to that. She was a little angry with herself
 that the shrink had been able to maneuver her
 into such a position. She was really cunning. Why
 did this of all schools to have a psychologist with
 a power complex? She got little more agitated,
 and started to think of other things to calm
 herself.
 <!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >The new home&#8217;s kitchen was nice. Much bigger
 than the old one, and the appliances were much
 better. Cooking there would be more enjoyable.
 She suspected she&#8217;d to be cooking far more often
 than in the old home. With mom&#8217;s new job she
 would be home even less than before. And as
 her cooking was the most agreeable, it was
 highly probable that she would have to feed the
 household.
 <!--l. 64--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Maybe I can work out a deal with mom and dad</span>
 <span

 <span

 <span

 new students to the secretary for filing, she
 entered Ms. Li&#8217;s office to report to her first. This
 was always wise in case of required corrections to

 new students?&#8221;

 other four students were normal: disoriented,

hers.
<!--l. 96--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Well, the stoners don&#8217;t cause any trouble as long
as they do not bring anything on school premises.
And hardly ever complain about anything. If

They are a mixed bag. Both are not entirely
happy with their body, but who is. Quinn, the
younger one, has adjusted quite well and I don&#8217;t
expect any trouble from her. The older one,
Daria, however has at least a problem with
authority. I sent her to self-esteem class just
for stubborn self-determined behavior during
the interview. She clearly needs an attitude
adjustment.&#8221;

devices weren&#8217;t bad either. Did you know Coach
Gibson has a pacemaker and Ms. Barch wears a

<!--l. 115--><p class="noindent" >That was rather interesting information, but Ms.

 should make sure she&#8217;s occupied with something.

 On autopilot she had fetched her sketchbook and

 answered. She became alert, maybe she&#8217;d get
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
another chance.
<!--l. 373--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Excellent!&#8221;
<!--l. 375--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Something that&#8217;ll really make them suffer.&#8221;
<!--l. 377--><p class="noindent" >His voice was not as deep as Jane expected, but
while it was soft, its presence filled the room.
Still, something stroke Jane as odd. Maybe he had
a cold. No kissy-kissy tonight. At least he had her
sense of humor, and enough backbone to voice
it.
<!--l. 383--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Uh... it&#8217;s healthy to air these feelings... I think.
We&#8217;ll talk more about this tomorrow. Class
dismissed.&#8221;
<!--l. 385--><p class="noindent" >Mr O&#8217;Neill ended the class right on the bell,
collected his notes and followed the quicker
students outside. Daria steeled herself for the
things to come.
<!--l. 388--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">No use in stalling this. I really hate to do this.</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">Every time.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 390--><p class="noindent" >In exception to her usual habits, Jane did not
hightail out of the class room, but remained
seated and watched the boy putting his things
into his backpack. As he rose, Jane rose as
well.
<!--l. 396--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Time for the truth. Pretty please, all you higher</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">beings. Let him say yes, and I&#8217;ll sacrifice you a</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">pizza as a burnt offering. A fresh one, not one of</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">those out of the back of our freezer. Hell, just</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">don&#8217;t let him say No.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 398--><p class="noindent" >As the boy rose, it hit Jane how tall he really was.
Taller than Jesse, taller than Trent. Compared to
him, Trent was a stick. And then he turned. His
army jacket, covered the most impressive set of
pecs Jane had come across so far.
<!--l. 402--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Wait a minute...</span>&#187;
<!--l. 406--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Look, Jane Lane. My name is Daria, and
beside this sorry excuse for a class we have
two more things in common: We&#8217;re both girls
and we both like boys. Good luck applying
elsewhere.&#8221;
<!--l. 408--><p class="noindent" >Daria delivered her explanation with practiced
ease, turned, and set course for home. Watching
the puzzlement of those who were mistaken had
lost its novelty a long time ago. Having to repeat
what she&#8217;d say was not exactly exciting either.  And the usual lame excuses did nothing for
 her.
 <!--l. 414--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Quinn, thank the gods that you&#8217;ll never have</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">to go through this. This is so humiliating it</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">hurts.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 416--><p class="noindent" >Deep in thought Daria left the school&#8217;s premises
 and walked home.

 <!--l. 12--><p class="noindent" >Jane Lane was rooted to the floor. Her mind had
 acquired some information, but refused to process
 it and thus stalled all higher brain functions.
 After her brain rebooted itself, Jane noticed that
 she was the last person in the class room. Even he
 was gone. She. What had happened? Jane opted
 to deal with it her usual way. Run home. Change.
 Run some more. She was good at running away
 problems.

 <!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >The Fashion Club after school emergency meeting
 was in full swing. Stacy had initiated the phone
 conference as soon as she arrived home to inform
 her fellow club members of her new findings
 about the tall girl. The fact that she was in
 freshman class made an impact like a bomb.
 This was so in violation of all known laws of
 nature.
 <!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Her name&#8217;s Quinn. Quinn Morgensomething. A
 very unusual name.&#8221;
 <!--l. 30--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Gee, Stacy, that&#8217;s not a very unusual name,
 but a very uncute name. Is her face equally
 uncute?&#8221;
 <!--l. 34--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No, Sandi, she&#8217;s so, like, perfect. Flawless, even
 complexion with small pores. A cute nose.
 Sparsely but skillfully applied makeup. And her
 hair color is natural, I couldn&#8217;t spot any roots
 showing.&#8221;
 <!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Sheeee was soooo taaaaall.&#8221; Tiffany stated the
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
obvious.
<!--l. 38--><p class="noindent" >Stacy hurried to give more precise information.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Yes, Ms. Barch had to take a step back to be
able to look her properly in the eyes. And when
she walked over, I felt soooo small. She must be
6&#8217;2", may be even more!&#8221;
<!--l. 45--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Ah, Stacy, for sure you overlooked the heels she
was wearing. Like those four inch heels those
streetside workers wear. Not that I&#8217;d know what
they look like.&#8221;
<!--l. 48--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No, Sandi, she wasn&#8217;t even wearing any heels,
just plain sneakers. But her legs go on, like, for
miles. And...and...and...&#8221;
<!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" >Once she started to sound like a broken record,
Stacy needed to be nudged like one - and Sandi
was happy to do so.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Yes Stacy. I don&#8217;t have, like, time all day. Tell us,
or is your memory deteriorating?&#8221;
<!--l. 55--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;...her figure.&#8221; Stacy said in a small voice.
<!--l. 57--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Stacy, would you please tell us your findings and
not waste my time.&#8221;
<!--l. 61--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Her figure&#8217;s so perfect. So mature. At least like a
senior girl. The distinct hips that have a perfect
sway as she walks. Her breasts are prominent, but
not ostentatious. And the perfect curves in
between.&#8221;
<!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" >Sandi knew that Stacy had to be exagerating, and
only one possible reason came to her mind.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;What, Stacy, are you going to tell me that you&#8217;re
switching teams next?&#8221;
<!--l. 67--><p class="noindent" >Ever since a girl had made a rather blunt pass at
her, lesbianism was nothing Tiffany would
tolerate.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Ewwww, Stacy. That is sooooo unfashionable.&#8221;
<!--l. 71--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;NO! Of course I&#8217;m not ... that. But I felt so
inferior.&#8221;
<!--l. 73--><p class="noindent" >Sandi was not sure what to make of Stacy&#8217;s
description. Stacy felt inferior to about everybody.
And that Quinn girl having a senior girl&#8217;s figure
did not matter either. Even if she had been only
two weeks at Lawndale High she had decided
that none of the senior girls did measure up to
her. And those guys who would prefer one of
the senior girls over the Fashion Club weren&#8217;t   dateworthy to begin with.
 <!--l. 82--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Gee Stacy, you make it sound as if we should
 consider her as a potential member of the Fashion
 Club. That is something that I&#8217;ll have to evaluate
 carefully.&#8221;
 <!--l. 84--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Anoooother member?&#8221; Tiffany asked, knowing
 that Sandiconsidered her expandeble.
 <!--l. 87--><p class="noindent" >Stacy was happy that Sandi made the suggestion
 that she had not dared to make.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;YES! I mean, yes Sandi. We should consider this.
 Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice to have another girl to discuss
 current fashions with?&#8221;
 <!--l. 93--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Well, Stacy, I&#8217;ll have to see for myself if your eyes
 didn&#8217;t deceive you. Any further findings?&#8221;
 <!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yes, Sandi. She tried to talk to me. She asked
 about boys...&#8221;
 <!--l. 99--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Of course she did. With a degenerated body like
 that she is likely to get no dates at all. I mean,
 what sane boy would date a lamp post? Are
 there any news on the guy we spotted this
 morning?&#8221;
 <!--l. 101--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;The taaall one&#8221; Tiffany said dreamily.
 <!--l. 104--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No, Sandi. He was seen taking the tour with the
 group of new students, but I have heard nothing
 about him attending any classes or anything else.&#8221;
 Stacy reported as was her duty.
 <!--l. 110--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;That is not much information, but I believe I
 can not expect any better from you, Stacy.
 Anything else? No? OK, lets do an additional
 color coordination meeting tomorrow before
 school at the usual time and place. Meeting
 adjourned.&#8221;
 <!--l. 112--><p class="noindent" >Sandi smiled a little at herself as she put the
 phone down. Maybe somebody had arrived that
 was an opponent - not a victim. She had ordered
 her troops to stand by so she would be ready to
 face her down.

 <!--l. 119--><p class="noindent" >Quinn went home alone. She and Daria had
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
forgotten to arrange a meeting point and time for
this, so she had waited 5 minutes at the school&#8217;s
main exit. Someone from the office informed
Quinn that Daria would be late, and had told her
to go home alone.
<!--l. 124--><p class="noindent" >The strange girl from her science class left
the room at the sound of the bell like greased
lightening. Quinn was sure she hadn&#8217;t offended
her, so maybe she was just shy. She gave that
vibe. Her other classmates had stared at her, but
steered clear of her. At least after the the teacher
left the class room, some of the boys looked at her
as she left the room.
<!--l. 136--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">What a weird day. I didn&#8217;t get a chance to talk to</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">Daria after she took that stupid psych test.</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">Well, a test is a test and Daria outsmarted the</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">quack for sure. With the older students around</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">high school feels much more comfortable than</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">middle school. I don&#8217;t stick out as much. It&#8217;s</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">bad in my freshman class though. And Daria</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">didn&#8217;t pave the way for me as she did in middle</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">school. She had the undivided attention as the</span>
<span

<span 
class="ecti-1095">it.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 138--><p class="noindent" >Arriving home, Quinn noted the empty driveway.
Despite their promise to be home when the girls
came in from their first day at the new school
both of her parents were still at work. She
unlocked the door and entered her still unfamiliar
new home. After hanging up her coat she put her
backpack down at the bottom of the stairs and
headed over to the kitchen. Rummaging through
the well stocked refrigerator she picked up a
ultra low fat yoghurt and ate it in silence at
the kitchen counter. The locked door, and
the missing jacket hinted at Daria still being
away.
<!--l. 147--><p class="noindent" >Daria was still not home when she heard her
mother&#8217;s urban assault vehicle arrive in the
driveway.
<!--l. 151--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hello girls, I&#8217;m back. Sorry I&#8217;m late, but the
traffic&#8217;s much worse than I expected. I bet your
father has the same problem.&#8221;
<!--l. 153--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hi mom.&#8221;                                   <!--l. 155--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Ah Quinn. How was your first day at high
 school?&#8221;
 <!--l. 157--><p class="noindent" >Helen put down her handbag on the counter and
 slipped out of her heeled shoes.
 <!--l. 163--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;OK, I guess. I only attended a single real
 class. We first got a tour of the school by the
 principal and than had to talk to the school
 psychologist which was totally pointless. The class
 was unfamiliar, and the girl I tried to talk to
 wouldn&#8217;t talk back so I think she&#8217;s shy. Besides I
 got stared at a lot.&#8221;
 <!--l. 166--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Well, that was to be expected. It&#8217;s the same as it
 was with Daria in middle school. How are you
 faring?&#8221;
 <!--l. 171--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No problems so far. I had minimal interaction
 with the other students, and they just asked the
 obvious &#8216;How tall are you?&#8217;. The secretary is a
 little slow, she mistook Daria for a boy even
 though she had her records at hand.&#8221;
 <!--l. 174--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s bad, Daria doesn&#8217;t take that well. I
 bet she bet with your Dad on it, didn&#8217;t she....
 Where&#8217;s Daria?&#8221;
 <!--l. 178--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;She&#8217;s not home yet, we forgot to agree to meet
 after school and I didn&#8217;t spot her at the main
 gate, so I walked home alone. Someone from the
 office said she would be late.&#8221;
 <!--l. 180--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Did you check the answering machine?&#8221;
 <!--l. 182--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Aeh, no. I forgot, the house&#8217;s still so unfamiliar.&#8221;
 <!--l. 184--><p class="noindent" >As expected, the answering machine was flashing.
 Helen played back the single message and walked
 back into the kitchen.
 <!--l. 190--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;That was your principal. Daria has to take a
 self-esteem course after school. I was hoping she
 was beyond that stage. And they asked for an OK
 for you to participate in PE. I&#8217;m going to write
 you a &#8216;OK&#8217; slip later on, Quinn.&#8221;
 <!--l. 192--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">I knew it.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Maybe Daria just pissed the shrink off.&#8221;
 <!--l. 197--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Quinn, language! Four years ago I would have
 been sure. But now ... I just don&#8217;t know about
 her. Well, she didn&#8217;t get into any trouble and
 maybe it will help her a little. Maybe she can
 make some friends there.&#8221;
 <!--l. 200--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Who knows that kind of psychos are collected
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
there. What&#8217;s for dinner, mom?&#8221;
<!--l. 203--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hmm, I&#8217;m too exhausted to start any serious
cooking and Daria and Jake are late. I guess I&#8217;ll
just put one of these frozen lasagnas into the
oven.&#8221;
<!--l. 205--><p class="noindent" >Quinn smiled inwardly. That was the most serious
cooking her mother had been doing ever sice
Daria had joined in on her father&#8217;s cooking
adventures. And in contrast to her father, Daria
produced quite tasty meals. A little too rich for
Quinn&#8217;s taste, but she simply ate what she
liked.
<!--l. 211--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;m going upstairs, mom. I&#8217;ll have a look at my
new textbooks - I need to make up for the last
two weeks.&#8221;

<!--l. 217--><p class="noindent" >A tall glass of tap water in her hand, a freshly
showered Jane sat at the Lane&#8217;s kitchen table and
stared off into space. She prefered OJ after a run,
but there wasn&#8217;t any in the fridge. Her training
gave her time to process the day&#8217;s events. She had
seriously drooled after a girl. There was no way
of denying that. And she couldn&#8217;t even get
the images out of her mind after she found
out the &#8216;he&#8217; was a &#8216;she&#8217;. She remembered her
brief and concise statement only in pieces. She
had said her name, but Jane could not recall
it.
<!--l. 225--><p class="noindent" >She could however recall clearly the impressive
chest that had presented her as the girl turned
towards her. And Jane still was curious what it
would feel like under her fingers. Or those eyes,
that had seemed to look straight into her soul.
Those lips, that seemed so kissable.
<!--l. 232--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">God damn it, Jane. A Girl a girl a girl. You need</span>
<span

<span 
class="ecti-1095">looks like a guy, she&#8217;s still a girl. And you like</span>
<span

<span 
class="ecti-1095">that.</span>&#187;                                       <!--l. 234--><p class="noindent" >Later Trent entered the kitchen and headed to the
 fridge. He noted Jane, but she sat unmovingly
 at the table, most likely beat from her run.
 Opening the fridge he noted its state. Empty.
 Uhoh, he had been supposed to get groceries
 today.
 <!--l. 239--><p class="noindent" >No run could exhaust Jane enough to stop
 her from chewing him out for not doing this
 chore. He noted the water in her glass. Jane
 was obviously troubled. He sat down at the
 table across from her and watched her for a
 while.
 <!--l. 243--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Fridge&#8217;s empty.&#8221;
 <!--l. 245--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hmmm.&#8221;
 <!--l. 247--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Band practice was intense. I forgot.&#8221;
 <!--l. 249--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hmmm.&#8221;
 <!--l. 251--><p class="noindent" >Trent provided an opening for Jane to open up.
 She would have to do the rest. He continued to
 watch her to spot any hints indicating her
 predicament. The absence of tear marks and red
 eyes somewhat relieved him.
 <!--l. 255--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;There was a new guy at school today.&#8221;
 <!--l. 257--><p class="noindent" >Jane was opening up. However, he&#8217;d never seen
 her so troubled by guy problems up to now. As
 her brother, he didn&#8217;t like guys around her, but he
 knew...
 <!--l. 262--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;A total hunk. Tall. Broad shoulders. Dreamy
 hair. Wicked appearance. Sweet voice. Material
 from a dream. A wet dream. He&#8217;s in self-esteem
 class as well.&#8221;
 <!--l. 264--><p class="noindent" >Trent smiled a little. Jane just had it bad. He
 couldn&#8217;t wait to see the paintings and sketches to
 come. Jane stood up, walked over to her backpack
 that was slumped at the bottom of the stairs and
 retrieved her sketchbook. She opened it to
 the sketches she did in self-esteem class and
 tossed it over to Trent. He looked at it, and
 accredited the greek statue to Jane&#8217;s vivid
 imagination.
 <!--l. 271--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I had the perfect chance and made a pass at him.
 A little blunt.&#8221;
 <!--l. 273--><p class="noindent" >Trent&#8217;s smile instantly dropped from his face.
 He became alert, as he feared the possible
 implications. Jane noted his reaction.
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
<!--l. 276--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Nothing happened. How could it? He was a
she.&#8221;
<!--l. 278--><p class="noindent" >Trent raised an eyebrow. He would have laughed
at it if it wasn&#8217;t troubling Jane.
<!--l. 281--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I drooled all day over a girl. And made a very
blunt proposition at her.&#8221;
<!--l. 283--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;It was a mistake.&#8221;
<!--l. 285--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yes. No. Maybe.&#8221;
<!--l. 287--><p class="noindent" >Trent waited for Jane to continue.
<!--l. 291--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I like guys. I know she&#8217;s a girl. But I still want to
know how it feels to be hold in those strong arms.
Feel those glorious pecs. Argh, tits, tits, tits. God,
I&#8217;m so disturbed.&#8221;
<!--l. 293--><p class="noindent" >Trent was not impressed. When he had been
rummaging through the attic some years ago he
had come across some pictures his father had
taken during his parents&#8217; hippie days. Pictures
that no child should ever be exposed to. He knew
for sure that his mother had been &#8216;sexually
non preferential&#8217;. He was open about these
things. If Jane&#8217;s nature was that way, so be
it.
<!--l. 300--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Look, you&#8217;re upset. You had high hopes, tried,
things didn&#8217;t work out. Sleep on it, and rethink it
tomorrow.&#8221;
<!--l. 303--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Sleeping is your solution to everything, Trent!
God, I&#8217;ll never be able to look her straight in the
eyes.&#8221;
<!--l. 307--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">What must the girl feel like - being mistaken for</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">a guy, and bluntly propositioned. But Jane</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">doesn&#8217;t need that guilt right now. Maybe I can</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">distract her a little. Change the subject - with a</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">hammer...</span>&#187;
<!--l. 310--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;The fridge&#8217;s still empty. I&#8217;m gonna ride to Food
Lord. Wanna tag along?&#8221;
<!--l. 312--><p class="noindent" >Jane sighed and considered Trent&#8217;s offer. His try
at distracting her was obvious, but working. She
needed to get her mind of the whole mess.
<!--l. 316--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yeah. At least then I can make sure you&#8217;re
buying what you&#8217;re supposed to. And that you
don&#8217;t fall asleep testing the demonstration lawn
chairs.&#8221;
<!--l. 318--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hey, that only happened once!&#8221;
<!--l. 321--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Right, right. Get your stuff, we&#8217;ll head out. By the way, we&#8217;ll stop for pizza on the way back and
 you&#8217;re gonna pay.&#8221;
 <!--l. 323--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">This is better. Much better.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Janey, I...&#8221;
 <!--l. 326--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You forgot, you pay.&#8221;
 <!--l. 328--><p class="noindent" >Jane and Trent rode in silence. Currently just
 being there for her was the best thing he could
 do. A sexuality crisis. Why did he have to deal
 with that - this was his parents&#8217; job. But a job
 they didn&#8217;t care about. The memories from the
 visit to the OB/GYN still haunted Trent. Janey
 had gotten her first period, nobody beside him
 had been around, and being male he had had not
 the slightest clue what to do. So he had taken her
 to the doctor. A 18 year old guy with a 12 year
 old girl visit the OB/GYN. He could still fell
 the stares. He had expected to be arrested
 as soon they left the doctor&#8217;s practice. After
 being tarred and feathered. But Janey was
 well.
 <!--l. 338--><p class="noindent" >
 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-34000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 340--><p class="noindent" >As Daria arrived at her new home, both of her
 parents&#8217; cars stood in the driveway. There was a
 garage, but it was still filled with boxes that
 nobody cared to unpack since the move a week
 ago. Daria was not sure how her parents would
 react on her late arrival and felt a little uneasy
 as she opened the door and announced her
 presence.
 <!--l. 346--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;m home. Hi mom, dad, Quinn.&#8221;
 <!--l. 348--><p class="noindent" >Daria hung up her jacket as the salutations
 emerged from the kitchen. She put her backpack
 down at the bottom of the staircase and entered
 the kitchen.
 <!--l. 351--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hi sweety, you&#8217;re back!&#8221;
 <!--l. 353--><p class="noindent" >Her mother was by the oven looking at something
 inside, while her father set the table. Quinn was
 out of sight.
 <!--l. 356--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Sorry I&#8217;m late mom, but ...&#8221;
 <!--l. 360--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;They put you in the self-esteem class after a
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
psyche test. There was a call on the answering
machine, so we didn&#8217;t have to worry. Want to tell
me about it?&#8221;
<!--l. 362--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;At least you didn&#8217;t get into any trouble.&#8221; her
father chimed in.
<!--l. 365--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hmm, maybe later at the table. I won&#8217;t have to
tell things twice that way. Dad?&#8221;
<!--l. 367--><p class="noindent" >Daria fished two crumpled five dollar bills from
her wallet that she took out of the back pocket of
her jeans. The thought of lying and pocket a
tenner never crossed her mind.
<!--l. 371--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Here&#8217;s your ten. You&#8217;ve won. Two exactly. And
one I got in writing.&#8221;
<!--l. 373--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;That&#8217;s ... great kiddo.&#8221;
<br class="newline" />Jake knew it was not, but he had won anyway.
<!--l. 376--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Kiddo my ass.</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t exactly fair. I wasn&#8217;t in any regular
class today, so I had next to no exposure. Double
the bet for tomorrow?&#8221;
<!--l. 380--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Ok, you&#8217;re on.&#8221;
<br class="newline" />Jake was not happy about it, but it would provide
him with another opportunity to sneak Daria a
10 without giving Helen the opportunity to
object.
<!--l. 386--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Jake. Daria. You know I do not like you gambling.
Especially on such matters. Daria, Quinn told me
about that stupid secretary, but what do you
mean by &#8216;in writing&#8217;.&#8221;
<!--l. 388--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hold a second, mom.&#8221;
<!--l. 390--><p class="noindent" >Daria retrieved the note from her jacket&#8217;s pocket.
She had not had the nerve to throw it away. And
she somehow admired the artsy bluntness of the
note. She handed it over the kitchen counter to
her mother.
<!--l. 394--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Oh, dear. That is rather...&#8221;
<!--l. 397--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Let me put it this way. If I were into girls, I
would have gotten lucky tonight.&#8221;
<!--l. 399--><p class="noindent" >Quinn had heard the increase in conversation
downstairs and came down on her own, expecting
her sister to be back. Daria&#8217;s last statement was
the first she could make out clearly.
<!--l. 403--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; she asked from the bottom of the
stairs and walked over to her mother, who still
held on to the note. Quinn read it over her     mother&#8217;s shoulder, which was an easy feat
 for her even though her mother was standing
 upright.
 <!--l. 408--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Oh. Whoa. I always thought just guys would be
 so...&#8221; That Jane Lane gal had some nerve. She&#8217;d
 have a serious talk with her.
 <!--l. 411--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;How did you react?&#8221; Helen asked Daria. She
 didn&#8217;t need her daughter to scare people on the
 first day at school.
 <!--l. 415--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I got the note during class, so I had plenty
 of time to think of an answer. I just pointed
 the facts out to her. You know I hate doing
 this.&#8221;
 <!--l. 417--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Was she cute?&#8221;
 <!--l. 419--><p class="noindent" >Quinn&#8217;s question sidetracked Daria. She had
 hardly looked at this Jane Lane. What was Quinn
 trying to get at? She shrugged.
 <!--l. 422--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I dunno. Didn&#8217;t really look at her.&#8221;
 <!--l. 424--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;What else is this self-esteem class about?&#8221;
 <!--l. 426--><p class="noindent" >Helen tried to keep the conversation on track as
 long as Daria was in a particularly communicative
 mood.
 <!--l. 431--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;The teacher recites some feel-good babble
 from some book he memorized. Today was
 about &#8216;actualizing your reality.&#8217;. Or was it
 &#8216;realizing your actuality&#8217;? Something along those
 lines.&#8221;
 <!--l. 433--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">And I have no idea what reality he is from...</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 436--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;And why did you get sent there? You do not
 exactly lack self-esteem and are quite able to
 assert yourself.&#8221;
 <!--l. 439--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You know my dislike for shrinks. I guess my lack
 of cooperation ticked that quack a little. I told her
 as little as possible.&#8221;
 <!--l. 441--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;&#8216;Lack of cooperation&#8217;, Daria?&#8221;
 <!--l. 443--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Mom does not need to know all the details.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;She had to point to the county&#8217;s regulations to
 make me talk. And I stuck to the bare essentials.&#8221;
 <!--l. 447--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I still don&#8217;t see the problem.&#8221;
 <!--l. 450--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I think her problem is that I think by myself and
 don&#8217;t simply do as I&#8217;m told to.&#8221;
 <!--l. 452--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Are you sure, Daria?&#8221;
 <!--l. 454--><p class="noindent" >Jake knew that his daughter was not free of
 psychological issues. Maybe that school shrink
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
had better instincts than Daria expected.
<!--l. 459--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Completely sure. You know I had my fill of talks
with shrinks. I know the experts&#8217; opinion is that
my &#8216;body image&#8217; is not well, but I also know that
I do not lack self-esteem.&#8221;
<!--l. 461--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Well, that&#8217;s you all right, but...</span>&#187;
<!--l. 464--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hmm, if you are sure that is a ridiculous reason
to send you to some class that is of no use for
you? I can call that principal and ...&#8221;
<!--l. 466--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Hell no!</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Mom. No. No way. Look, it might be unfair, and
your offer is well-meant. But I&#8217;d rather sit
through that course before I got another label
stuck to me. Please.&#8221;
<!--l. 472--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">That&#8217;s you as well: Endure in silence. I expected</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">you to have learned a different lesson in the</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">past.</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Well, Daria, that&#8217;s up to you, but you&#8217;re wasting
your time in that class. And sending you there as
a punishment is wrong to begin with. Do you
really not...&#8221;
<!--l. 477--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No mom. Please.&#8221;
<!--l. 480--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Maybe she can even learn a little bit in that
course, Helen. And it&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s going to make
things worse.&#8221;
<!--l. 483--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">I wonder if you would accept the help if the offer</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">came from your father...</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s your choice and your time. I think you
should really consider lying through your teeth as
an option when it comes to situations like that.
You are smart enough to pull it off.&#8221;
<!--l. 488--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Uhoh, Helen, that was not ...</span>&#187;
<!--l. 490--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You know I despise lying, mom.&#8221;
<!--l. 493--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I know. And you made your trade-off. Four weeks
after school classes instead of lying.&#8221;
<!--l. 496--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Well, I really should consider it. I don&#8217;t have to
start making a living of it.&#8221;
<!--l. 499--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Ouch, that could get ugly. Helen, why do you</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">poke Daria when she is irked already?</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Quinn, what people did you meet during your
first class in high school?&#8221;
<!--l. 505--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I tried to talk to the girl beside me in science
class. She was really cute and I thought we could
be friends. But she clammed up, so I guess she isshy. That class was generally weird. All the guys
 just sat there like statues...&#8221;
 <!--l. 507--><p class="noindent" >As Quinn prattled on, Jake went over to Daria,
 put a hand on her shoulder and looked her in the
 eyes. Hurt. Anxiety. He just saw it.
 <!--l. 510--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;It&#8217;s going to work out. Just give them some
 time.&#8221; Jake muttered to comfort Daria before he
 returned to the table. Quinn looked sadly at the
 scene, but went on.
 <!--l. 514--><p class="noindent" >The dinner was unspectacular. Quinn and Daria
 told about the school&#8217;s facilities, and Daria did
 not fail to mention the existence of the gym to her
 parents and announced she would be checking it
 out.
 <!--l. 519--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">I knew you would not let me get out of my</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">excercise. With mom and dad primed, it&#8217;s a done</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">deal.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 521--><p class="noindent" >Daria complained about the quality of the
 school&#8217;s cafeteria food, and hinted at preparing a
 lunch at home if the first day indicated the
 permanent quality. Quinn felt seriously relieved. If
 Daria did it for herself, she would not get around
 preparing a lunch for Quinn as well. And Daria&#8217;s
 food was good.
 <!--l. 526--><p class="noindent" >Helen and Jake told about their first day at work,
 and the lasagna was finished quickly. As the
 conversation continued, Jake stood up and got
 himself a can of beer from the fridge. After he
 closed the door, he squinted at the family planner
 that was affixed to its front. He reopened the
 fridge and got another can out, put both on
 the counter top and wrote something on the
 planner. Helen glared at him as he popped one of
 the cans and took a swig. He walked back to
 the table and put the second can in front of
 Daria.
 <!--l. 535--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Helen, she&#8217;s had a hard day. Her last one was
 more than three weeks ago.&#8221;
 <!--l. 537--><p class="noindent" >Jake sat down again, and Helen knew that the
 final word on that matter had been spoken.
 <!--l. 540--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Thanks Dad.&#8221;
 <!--l. 542--><p class="noindent" >Quinn watched Daria reach for the beer.
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Yeah, and my day was all fun and giggles,</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">Daddy, so </span><span 
class="ecbi-1095">I </span><span 
class="ecti-1095">don&#8217;t need any comfort...</span>&#187;
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
<!--l. 546--><p class="noindent" >Daria popped the can as well and took a little
swig. Then she got up and began loading the
dishwasher. With the convenience food, this task
was completed in an eyeblink. Meanwhile Quinn
excused herself to her room, and so did Daria
once the kitchen looked decent again while her
parents gently talked among themselves. Her beer
in hand she stopped upstairs by Quinn&#8217;s room,
knocked and entered the pink universe. It was a
mystery to her where Quinn had located a
canopy bed in extra long. She wordlessly offered
the can to Quinn, knowing that it was not
smart to hog such privileges. Especially as
long as Quinn declined to take her up on the
offer.
<!--l. 556--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Eww. That stuff is so gross.&#8221;
<br class="newline" />Nevertheless Quinn valued the gesture.
<!--l. 559--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Tomorrow is going to suck. Big time. Be
prepared.&#8221;
<!--l. 561--><p class="noindent" >That warning told, Daria closed the door and
retreated into her room. She had successfully
defended it against any remodelling. The padded
walls that had been installed to accommodate a
schizophrenic woman seemed appropriate for her
own state of mind. She swapped her boots for
some slippers and spent the rest of the evening
sorting through the boxes that still hadn&#8217;t been
unpacked since the move. Sorting her underwear
took a while, but putting her books in the shelves
was worse. She contemplated booting up her
computer and writing a little, but her mind was
not into it. So she chose to go to bed early, relax a
little and then sleep. She would have to get up a
little earlier tomorrow, as her dad would not give
them a ride. Daria&#8217;s sleep that night was uneasy.
