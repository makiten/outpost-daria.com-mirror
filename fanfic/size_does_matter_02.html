 <!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >Daria prepared for school. Packing her P.E. stuff
 she wondered how that class would work out.
 Downstairs Helen and Jake rushed through
 the final stages of their morning preparations,
 guzzling down coffee (&#8216;Gah! Dammit, hot!&#8217;) and
 collecting files. Daria poured herself a nice bowl of
 cereal with milk and a glass of OJ to get herself
 started for her day.
 <!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >Helen announced that she would have her first
 day in court today, just as a visitor to get to know
 the judges and so on, and therefore did not know
 when she would be back in. Jake, however, said
 that he just had some interviews for the part time
 secretary during the morning at the office,
 and would likely be back home in the early
 afternoon after he ran some errands for his
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
office.
<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >Quinn came down just in time to say goodbye to
Jake and Helen, who mounted their vehicles and
left. Daria addressed her sister immediately
afterwards.
<!--l. 31--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;m going to leave a little early. I&#8217;m not ready to
face the masses yet.&#8221;
<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You can&#8217;t hide forever, Daria.&#8221;
<br class="newline" />Quinn said between the bites she took from an
apple.
<!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I know. I just hope...you know. I&#8217;m off. See you
later.&#8221;
<!--l. 38--><p class="noindent" >That said, Daria left and walked through the
pleasant October sun towards Lawndale High.
Today she would stick to the main road, but from
tomorrow on she would look for a quieter and
maybe shorter path to school.
<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>*****</h4>
<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >Sandi Griffin rode her convertible with the top
down to enjoy the last rays of sunshine the year
offered. The installed wind deflector ensured that
her carefully styled hair did not get messed up by
the draft.
<!--l. 48--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Look at that loser walking ... hold it.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" >Green army jacket, dark trousers, tall. Sandi was
sure and slowed her approach. That was the new
guy she had gotten a glimpse at yesterday, before
he had vanished into the building. Sandi slowed
down to bit above a pedestrian&#8217;s pace about
eighty yards behind him to get a closer look. The
reddish morning sun brought out some really red
highlights in his brown wavey hair, which was well
kept for a guy. He walked with a sure walk, and
even if his butt ugly clothing hid most of his
figure, it was clear that he had much to offer in
that department.
<!--l. 59--><p class="noindent" >The clothing could be exchanged easily, and her
intuition was that his face would be sufficiently
cute to match his body. This was a guy worthy to
be seen with Sandi Griffin, the president of the  Fashion Club. Sandi closed the distance between
 her and the guy, and as soon as she was level with
 him, she addressed him, diverting her attention
 between him and the road.
 <!--l. 67--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hey, you, like, the new guy. I&#8217;m Sandi Griffin,
 the president of the Lawndale High Fashion Club.
 I really like strong tall guys. Could you take me to
 an decent restaurant, I&#8217;m usually, like, hungry
 after school?&#8221;
 <!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">One. Crap. And I haven&#8217;t even made it to school</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">yet.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Me too. On both accounts.&#8221;
 <!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >Sandi hit the brake and looked at the guy who
 stopped as well.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Ex-cuse me? What was that?&#8221;
 <!--l. 75--><p class="noindent" >Daria turned towards the girl, who sat in a yellow
 convertible, and elaborated her answer.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;I like strong tall guys and am usually hungry
 after school as well.&#8221;
 <!--l. 79--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You&#8217;re, like, gay?&#8221;
 <br class="newline" />Sandi was dejected. The guy had a soft face with
 full lips and a rather small nose for a guy. His
 complexion was even with not even a hint of
 beard. His pecs, hidden under the jacket, were
 spectacular, as far as Sandi could see from her
 car. If well behaved, a guy like him was a definite
 candidate for a steady date.
 <!--l. 87--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">With that ego, there can&#8217;t be any room for</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">thoughts in her head. And now I&#8217;m gay</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;No. Look Sandi Griffin, president of the
 Lawndale High Fashion Club. We&#8217;re both girls,
 and we both like guys. So let&#8217;s get on with our
 lives.&#8221;
 <!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" >Daria turned and continued on her way to school
 without looking back.
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">That pass yesterday had at least some class, in a</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">wicked sense.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />Daria would have preferred to go home. But she
 knew it would be futile.
 <!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" >Sandi looked at the leaving figure. &#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Soooo hot ...</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">hold it. RIGHT NOW. SHE. Girl. Female.</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">Unattractive.</span>
 <br class="newline" /><span 
class="ecti-1095">What is it with me?</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 99--><p class="noindent" >Sandi noted the clock on the dashboard. She&#8217;d
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
have to hurry to make it in time for the pre-school
color coordination meeting of the Fashion Club.
<!--l. 102--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>*****</h4>
<!--l. 104--><p class="noindent" >Jane Lane hurried to pack her school things,
trying not to forget anything important. She had
not overslept since she had not slept at all. Her
thoughts had been too busy processing the events
of yesterday&#8217;s afternoon. It took a pot of weapon
grade coffee to get her going this morning, and
her sleepy eyes spoke volumes. Luckily the Lane
pantry was well stocked after the trip to the Food
Lord the evening before. Trent&#8217;s plan to distract
her had worked pretty well. Until she was back
alone in her room.
<!--l. 112--><p class="noindent" >Her pondering had led to no solution. She liked
guys, that she was sure of. She was attracted to
the body she had seen, that was sure as well. And
it did not matter to her if it was a boy&#8217;s or a girl&#8217;s
body. That was something she needed to come to
terms with.
<!--l. 117--><p class="noindent" >The girl was likely a senior, likely related to that
tall red head that had been in the tour group as
well. Because of this Jane was unlikely to cross
her path, and could stall any thoughts of how to
act around her - after the incident the day
before - until the issue arose. In self-esteem
class.
<!--l. 122--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a>*****</h4>
<!--l. 124--><p class="noindent" >Daria continued her trek to school. She really
hated this. It would pass away, but she hated
it anyway. She&#8217;d love to lose the bet she&#8217;d
made with her dad. She&#8217;d always hated to be
a weedy bookish wallflower and would have
liked some of the attention her sister got. That
was, until about 3 years ago. Then she got all
the attention she had ever wanted - and then
some.                                       <br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Beware of your wishes. They may come true.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 131--><p class="noindent" >Maybe things wouldn&#8217;t get that bad this time,
 and she would find her niche, make some
 acquaintances and mark her time at high school
 in peace. Maybe even a real friend. Male or
 female wouldn&#8217;t matter that much. Or maybe
 even a nice, clean cut boyfriend that would be
 able to deal with her. Nothing for an eternity.
 Just for the time at school would be a perfect
 start.
 <!--l. 137--><p class="noindent" >She still did not understand how Quinn could revel
 in all the gawking, pointing and the questions.
 They were freaks of nature that did not fit in.
 Well, that wasn&#8217;t right. She was a too large
 square peg and Quinn a too large round peg.
 Both did not fit into the round hole, but at least
 Quinn looked as if she could.
 <!--l. 143--><p class="noindent" >Only a few other students milled around as she
 passed the main gate. They looked, but nothing
 more. Convenient, to Daria&#8217;s taste. On her way to
 the main entrance she saw two girls occupying the
 same spot as the group of three had done the day
 before. Maybe waiting for number three to
 complete their circle.
 <!--l. 148--><p class="noindent" >
 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-6000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 150--><p class="noindent" >Stacy and Tiffany waited at the usual spot
 for their pre-school meeting. Stacy glanced
 nervously at her watch. It was only two minutes
 until the meeting would begin, and Sandi was
 still not present. Sandi was always early. Did
 they change the location and she missed it?
 Would she lose her post as the Fashion Club&#8217;s
 secretary? Would she be thrown out of the club
 entirely?
 <!--l. 156--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Loooook.&#8221;
 <!--l. 158--><p class="noindent" >Tiffany nodded towards the main gate and Stacy
 followed her gaze. There he was, tall as the day
 before. He wore basically the same clothes as
 yesterday, but seeing his front was new. He wore
 glasses and had a soft oval face. His step was
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
purposeful, with a surprising grace. And between
the straps of his backpack, his jacket revealed a
nice set of breasts.
<!--l. 164--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hmm, Tiffany, I think...&#8221;
<!--l. 166--><p class="noindent" >Stacy&#8217;s glance wandered down, and found what
she was looking for, but not really expecting.
Adam&#8217;s apple: missing. Hips; female hips. Not
prominent but present. Omygosh. A girl. That
verified, she continued.
<!--l. 170--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;...that this is not a guy. It&#8217;s a girl. A she.&#8221;
<!--l. 172--><p class="noindent" >Tiffany&#8217;s gaze speechlessly followed the - Boy?
Girl? - as - He? She? - walked towards the
entrance. Once she passed the pair, Tiffany spoke
up.
<!--l. 175--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I thinnnk you&#8217;re riiiight. That is sooooo wrong.&#8221;
<!--l. 179--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Did you see that, did you see that? It&#8217;s a girl, a
woman. But she&#8217;s got muscles all over. Her
hair&#8217;s nice. I don&#8217;t know about her face, the

<!--l. 190--><p class="noindent" >Sandi ran a little late due to her strange encounter
with that ... girl. She still shivered inwardly at the
thought of that episode. Her thoughts during that
conversation had been so wrong. Walking fast,
but graceful, Sandi reached her friends. Running
was so geeky.
<!--l. 196--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hello Stacy, hello Tiffany, I notice you really
made it on time to our meeting.&#8221;
<!--l. 198--><p class="noindent" >Stacy, a compulsive gossip, started to spill the
news immediately.
<!--l. 201--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;There&#8217;s big news. The guy from yesterday
passed us again. Well, not really, because he
isn&#8217;t. A guy I mean. She&#8217;s a girl. And wears
glasses.&#8221;                                     <!--l. 203--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Tell me something new. I already knew that.&#8221;
 <!--l. 205--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;How did you...&#8221;
 <!--l. 208--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Gee Stacy, I have my own sources in the gossip
 network. And I think they are better informed
 than yours.&#8221;
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span

 <span

 <span 
class="ecti-1095">freak.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 213--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yes, Sandi. The tall girl .... the other tall girl,
 Quinn, did not pass by until now.&#8221;
 <!--l. 219--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I hope you did not overlook her while ogling that
 she-male person, feeling attracted to a girl. Being
 attracted to a girl is a big fashion don&#8217;t. Think
 about those, like, you know, losers. Ew. Let&#8217;s
 talk about something non-disgusting, say, the
 latest Waif issue; I cannot afford to waste my
 precious time by just waiting. Did you see those
 ....&#8221;
 <!--l. 221--><p class="noindent" >This started the color coordination meeting of the
 Fashion Club. Every now and then a boy dropped
 by to beg for a date, or a girl to beg about a
 membership. An unusual amount of people,
 especially boys, hung around the school yard in
 general, and the noise level was basically too high
 for an effective Fashion Club meeting. Some
 people were just rude.
 <!--l. 229--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">The sophomore, junior and senior students must</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">be like total ignorgas..., clueless people. Not a</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">single one of them talked to me since we started</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">our freshman year at LHS. They must be simply</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">blind to real beauty.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 231--><p class="noindent" >Stacy whispered and pulled Sandi back to
 reality.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Sandi! Sandi! She&#8217;s here. She&#8217;s heading straight
 over to us. You&#8217;re the president, must do something!
 I couldn&#8217;t talk to her yesterday and she will
 totally hate me and I will not be able to talk to
 her either and I do not know how many classes we
 will share and ...&#8221;
 <!--l. 237--><p class="noindent" >And indeed, that Quinn girl came over. Sandi
 scrutinized her during her approach thoroughly.
 She was tall. She had long, flowing red hair. Her
 long legs and well defined hips turned the school
 yard into a catwalk and gave her an air of
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
superiority. She wore boot cut blue jeans sporting
some fashionable sneakers underneath. No heels.
A pink baby-T showed off a decent amount of
midriff including a flat tummy. It stretched a little
bit across her chest, just the right amount to
make men drool and women envious. Over that
she wore a simple cut jacket against the fresh
breeze. Sandi did not have to look around to
know that no boy in the vicinity talked, and
that all of their eyes were on her. She was
very mature for a freshman and positively a
looker. Sandi knew that her opponent had
arrived.
<!--l. 249--><p class="noindent" >She stopped a step away from the group. Sandi
was about to consider this rude, but as she tried
to look her in the eyes, she knew better. The
place where she usually looked was occupied by
the girl&#8217;s breasts.
<!--l. 254--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m Quinn Morgendorffer, aren&#8217;t you the girl
that sat next to me in science class the other
day?&#8221;
<br class="newline" />she addressed Stacy who looked like a deer in the
headlights.
<!--l. 259--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hel-lo. I am Sandi Griffin, the president of the
Lawndale High Fashion Club. This is Stacy Rowe,
our secretary, and Tiffany Blum-Deckler, our color
coordination officer.&#8221;
<!--l. 261--><p class="noindent" >Stacy limited herself to a nod. Tiffany did
nothing; her mind was completely occupied with
processing the visual image of Quinn.
<!--l. 264--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Nice to meet you, Sandi, Stacy, Tiffany&#8221; Quinn
politely replied.
<!--l. 269--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You are new at our school, one of the students
that transferred in yesterday? Then you could not
possibly know that Ms. Barch does not endorse
conversations and note passing during class. As
does any other teacher at this school.&#8221;
<!--l. 272--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Ah, yes, but I was not aware that violations are
punishable by death. At least Stacy&#8217;s reaction
looked like that.&#8221;
<!--l. 274--><p class="noindent" >Stacy became a little nervous as she became
aware that her reaction had looked tremendously
impolite. The same nervousness that had made
her react that way in the first place.           <!--l. 278--><p class="noindent" >Sandi elaborated.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Ms.Barch reserves capital punishment for males.
 But even as a female I would not recommend
 straining her patience.&#8221;
 <!--l. 282--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Is this why the boys hardly dare to breathe?&#8221;
 <!--l. 285--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yes. And it gives girls the chance for an easy
 grade in science, which is why Stacy is in that
 class.&#8221;
 <!--l. 287--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hi Quinn!&#8221; Stacy said, now a little bit reassured.
 The tall girl was an impressive sight, but seemed
 to be quite amicable.
 <!--l. 290--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hi Stacy, I wasn&#8217;t planning to get you into
 trouble.&#8221;
 <!--l. 292--><p class="noindent" >Sandi spoke up again to control the conversation.
 She was the president of the Fashion Club. She
 would do the talking.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;But your inconsiderate behaviour could have
 really put Stacy on the spot and thus cast a
 bad light at the Fashion Club. Therefore I
 must urge you to refrain from that kind of
 interaction with any members of the Fashion
 Club.&#8221;
 <!--l. 299--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;ll bear it in mind, since I like to stay out of
 trouble firsthand. What does your &#8216;Fashion Club&#8217;
 do to begin with?&#8221;
 <!--l. 304--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;We set an example for the total population of
 Lawndale on how to dress fashionably, and
 inspire people to see the error of their ways of
 fashion. Sometimes it takes real effort to make
 people realize how ugly they dress. The fashion
 violations seem to increase with every passing
 day.&#8221;
 <!--l. 306--><p class="noindent" >Quinn wasn&#8217;t sure if the girl meant to be rude, or
 just sounded that way.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Fashion violations?&#8221;
 <!--l. 312--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You for example are just abnormally tall. But
 that she-male that transferred in yesterday as well
 is a total butt-ugly freak. I can&#8217;t believe the laws
 of nature allow the existence of such a foul
 creature. And its sense of fashion is simply non
 existant.&#8221;
 <!--l. 314--><p class="noindent" >Sandi still could not forgive that girl for tricking
 her to think she was a boy. Thank god her mishap
 had happened out of sight of anyone. If that
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
episode had happened on school grounds ... the
possible rumors and the permanent damage those
allegations could have to her popularity. Too bad
that she was a girl...
<!--l. 319--><p class="noindent" >Quinn&#8217;s esteem for Sandi Griffin, the Fashion
Club president, dropped from &#8216;moron&#8217; over &#8216;scum&#8217;
straight to &#8216;piece of shit&#8217;.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;You mean like a wee bit smaller than me, brown
hair, green jacket?&#8221;
<!--l. 323--><p class="noindent" >Stacy&#8217;s eyes got big. The words were polite, the
voice was sweet, but a slight change in Quinn&#8217;s
body language promised trouble. She glanced at
Tiffany, who returned the glance with an equal
queasy feeling.
<!--l. 327--><p class="noindent" >Sandi was pleased that the new arrival obviously
had spotted the problem as well.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Ah, yes, you have seen that &#8216;girl&#8217; up close. She&#8217;s,
like, optical pollution.&#8221;
<!--l. 332--><p class="noindent" >Stacy knew she wasn&#8217;t a genius, but she could
spot trouble. There was a reason why one does
not call a football player stupid - at least not to
their faces. She inwardly shivered at the idea of
raw physical power unleashed. You could not
keep a can of pepper spray at hand all the
time.
<!--l. 337--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">You snotty bitch.</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;That would be my sister.&#8221;
<!--l. 340--><p class="noindent" >Sandi knew she stepped on a land mine. Attack
was still the best defence.
<!--l. 343--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;That makes it even worse, because that girl, like,
has someone with a sense for fashion around but
still does not know how to dress fashionably.&#8221;
<!--l. 345--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">You really failed the last reality check, didn&#8217;t</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">you?</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;That girl has a name, it&#8217;s Daria, and I&#8217;d
recommend not calling her any of that to her
face. I don&#8217;t like people hurting other people.
And I&#8217;d prefer if you would not badmouth <span 
class="ecbx-1095">my</span>
<span 
class="ecbx-1095">sister </span>at all to begin with. I think it would be
wise if you would not talk to or about her at
all.&#8221;
<br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Unlike you, Daria has a soul. Even if she does</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">not like to admit it.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 352--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">But I&#8217;d like to talk to... ARGH. Get a grip,</span>   <span 
class="ecti-1095">Griffin.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 354--><p class="noindent" >Sandi&#8217;s sortie did not have the effect she expected.
 The slight glance in Quinn&#8217;s eyes made it clear
 that she&#8217;d better drop the subject. Right now any
 road led to a phalli..., pyro...., bad victory.
 Appeasement seemed much better.
 <!--l. 359--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;At least you dress fashionably, but those jeans
 you&#8217;re wearing could use an update.&#8221;
 <!--l. 361--><p class="noindent" >Quinn smoldered, but decided to play nice. &#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">It</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">took a while, but you finally realize that it&#8217;s about</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">time to shut up, Puny Griffin.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m new in town, so I&#8217;m sure you can
 point me to a store around here that carries
 jeans in my size. During my stay in New York
 during the summer I had a really hard time
 finding clothes that come in my size and are
 fashionable, but I&#8217;m confident that you know
 where to find some here ... in the big city of
 Lawndale.&#8221;
 <!--l. 369--><p class="noindent" >Stacy had a hard time not smiling. This girl
 was somebody that could easily match Sandi.
 She felt a little uneasy about Quinn&#8217;s sister.
 She was the most unique girl she had come
 across so far, and simply intimidated her; even
 more than Sandi. But maybe that was just a
 prejudice.
 <!--l. 374--><p class="noindent" >Sandi tried to slowly regain the upper hand.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;I think we may accept your company on one of
 our Fashion Club shopping trips and show you the
 stores with acceptable apparel. You moved from
 New York to Lawndale?&#8221;
 <!--l. 379--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No, I was just there for summer classes.&#8221;
 <!--l. 381--><p class="noindent" >The girls chatted a little about less sensitive
 topics to get to know each other. Quinn learned
 about Ms. Barch&#8217;s dislike for anything male, and
 wondered if Daria had any classes with her.
 Quinn also learned about the characters of the
 Fashion Club&#8217;s members. Sandi was not impolite
 towards her and her sister because they were new.
 Sandi was generally impolite to everyone that
 was not herself. She seemed to love to control
 people. Either she did not know what image she
 projected, or she didn&#8217;t care. Dealing with her
 would be straining. Stacy was basically a sweet
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
girl, but a scaredy-cat. She babbled a lot about
vain things, and remained silent about anything
important. Her eyes told about her inner conflict
in such situations, so Quinn couldn&#8217;t label her
dumb and superficial. Tiffany was difficult to
understand. She didn&#8217;t talk much. In that regard
she was like Daria. If she spoke, she spoke
slow and simple - the exact opposite of Daria.
Quinn got the impression that Tiffany was
in general a little simple - and hoped to be
wrong.
<!--l. 396--><p class="noindent" >The girls walked together to their combined
homeroom.

<!--l. 401--><p class="noindent" >Jane Lane made it into homeroom just in time.
As usual, she grabbed her sketchbook from her
backpack and flipped it to an empty page. She
stalled at the sketches of Daria when Jane
thought of her as a &#8216;Darius&#8217; and recalled her
images from her memory. She couldn&#8217;t help it.
Even if she knew that this was a girl, she felt still
an attraction. Maybe it was the glorious figure.
Maybe it was just the aura she projected. Maybe
Jane was starting to come to terms that life was
not as straight forward as she thought it would
be.
<!--l. 410--><p class="noindent" >After homeroom Jane made it on time to her
American history class, where Mr DeMartino
prepared to ream any unlucky students out that
came in any second after the ring of the bell.
Most students were already present, and as usual
she avoided eye contact with anyone as she walked
towards her customary seat on the left side of the
class. Something felt different, and so she looked
up and scanned the class room. Teacher&#8217;s pets:
present. Jocks: present. Popular people: present.
Nerds and geeks: present. Stoners: physically
present. Weirdos, including herself: present. Big
green blop slumped over a table in the last row: present.

 <!--l. 423--><p class="noindent" >Jane drew a blank and switched to auto-mode.
 Ignore everybody, sit down, take notebook/sketchpad
 out. Sketch until class begins. Avoid being caught
 sketching by Mr. D.

 <!--l. 429--><p class="noindent" >Charles Ruttheimer III arrived early at school as
 usual. He had to watch the girls, which was his
 favorite occupation during his time at school,
 since the classes didn&#8217;t really pose a challenge.
 The week was so far still undecided. On Monday,
 the rumor of some really really luscious lady
 transferring in reached him. He was only able to
 spot her between two classes from afar, and
 found the rumours about her size being true.
 As for her hotness, he hadn&#8217;t seen much, but
 really liked the little that he had seen. He
 had scheduled a thorough investigation for
 today.
 <!--l. 438--><p class="noindent" >He arrived as usual just on time at home room -
 with Mr. DeMartino right before the American
 history class - and found this ... person slouched
 over in the usually unoccupied chair next to him.
 Approaching his seat he filed the person under
 &#8216;yet another football jock&#8217;. A jock with glasses, an
 unusual haircut and a weird taste in clothes, but a
 jock nevertheless.
 <!--l. 444--><p class="noindent" >Homeroom with its announcements had been
 unremarkable beside the surprised look that the
 taut gazelle that was Jane Lane had cast at the
 jock next to him. What was the story between
 those two? That did not seem right.
 <!--l. 448--><p class="noindent" >Mr. DeMartino introduced the jock, and
 immediately put his crosshairs on him with the
 intent to display his dislike of Kevin-alikes by
 thoroughly humiliating them. Charles had been
 about to fade into a nice daydream as he noted
 that Mr D&#8217;s plan did not work out. Charles
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
started to listen. The guy was very smart, and
went straight head on with Mr. D. And something
was wrong with his voice.
<!--l. 455--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-10000"></a>*****</h4>
<!--l. 457--><p class="noindent" >Jane followed the discussion and not her habit to
immediately indulge in sketching as soon as Mr.
DeMartino had picked a target. He was going
unusually hard after Daria, for no reason she
could fathom. And Daria kept up with profound
answers. That girl was clearly smart. Smarter
than Jane herself.
<!--l. 462--><p class="noindent" >Jane listened to the voice that had haunted her
through the night. A deep alto, but if you
knew it, a girl&#8217;s voice. She felt compelled to
look.

<span

<!--l. 471--><p class="noindent" >Looking sideways Charles noted a rather soft face.
What was the name, again? Daria. Ain&#8217;t that
female? The realization came slowly onto Charles.
That person was neither a jock nor a guy.
That was the weirdest chick that had ever
come under his eyes. And for the first time he
encountered a female that <span 
class="ecbx-1095">he </span>would reject. She
was not for his taste. Clearly too masculine.
He learned three valuable lessons during that
class. Even he did not go for everything female
including sheep, and he was positively not
gay.

 <!--l. 481--><p class="noindent" >Jane listened to the conversation. Daria did not
 know the teacher, but did not yield. That was a
 risky gamble, especially with Mr. DeMartino, who
 knew his subject well. And had a somewhat
 unpredictable personality with a streak of cruelty.
 <!--l. 486--><p class="noindent" >She shuddered at the memory of the episode when
 he had caught her sketching once. Of course
 he called her on it. Of course he figured out
 after 30 seconds that she had not done the
 assigned reading. Of course he spent an eternity
 grilling her and point out every tiny hole in her
 knowledge, liberally salted with condescending
 remarks about her scholastic abilities. Which
 were, considering her knowledge, or more the lack
 thereof, justified. Jane learned some valuable
 lessons that time.
 <!--l. 494--><p class="noindent" >Don&#8217;t get caught sketching the class away.
 At least skim the assigned chapters. Public
 humiliation is a damn good motivator. And
 she would never ever forget a single fact that
 she was supposed to know, but didn&#8217;t at that
 time.
 <!--l. 499--><p class="noindent" >Daria was lucky. She went head on with an
 opponent she didn&#8217;t know a thing about. That
 was not good practice, but at least she did not get
 into a defensive position. That line about not
 having any ethics was creative, but likely a
 blatant lie. She considered the concept, so at least
 she had some vague ideas about it. Even Brittany
 had ethics - even if she didn&#8217;t know about
 it.
 <!--l. 506--><p class="noindent" >Daria knew the answers and presented them with
 a weird sense of humor. The good kind of weird.
 And in addition, Daria had a serious backbone.
 Not only physically, but mentally as well. Jane
 liked that. If she could ever look that girl in
 the eyes again, she would be a person worth
 knowing.

<!--l. 513--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Two wars. More like a warlett and a war, in
direct comparison.&#8221;
<br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">What is your goddamn problem?! I didn&#8217;t do a</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">thing to you.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 516--><p class="noindent" >Mr. DeMartino chuckled at her last comment.
The girl had brainpower and matched him so far,
and was amusing in her own way. He would shift
his focus to an easier target.
<!--l. 521--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You can put it that way. NOW Kevin, what was
the name of the first of the said wars?&#8221;
<!--l. 523--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;The Vietnamese War?&#8221;
<!--l. 525--><p class="noindent" >As Mr. DeMartino shifted his focus off of Daria
and returned to his class Daria took some time to
have a look at her new classmates between taking
notes. In the front row sat a football player in
his uniform currently making a fool out of
himself by jumbling up about every historical
fact he tried to come up with to answer the
questions.
<!--l. 534--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">I can&#8217;t believe there are people as dumb as</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">him. And wear their sports uniform to class.</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">That blow-up doll next to him seems to be his</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">girlfriend. And she&#8217;s hardly smarter. God, should</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">they ever successfully reproduce, Darwin is</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">going to spin in his grave fast enough to undig</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">himself.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 536--><p class="noindent" >Immediately afterwards Daria scolded herself for
that thought. Despite often being subjected
to prejudice on her own, she was not as free
of them as she&#8217;d like to be. At least she had
noticed and would now consciously give them a
chance.
<!--l. 540--><p class="noindent" >A pair of black students, a rare sight at LHS, sat
in the front row as well. Make that a couple,
the way they glance at each other every now
and then. The black guy was of nice build, as
far as she could tell from her position. The
petite girl with the red hair sat in this class
as well. She spotted her looking and gave a
nod. Daria was not exactly happy with that,
but nodded back to be polite. A row in front
of her, several seats to her left sat the girl
from self-esteem class. She busied herself with  sketching.
 <!--l. 550--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">I didn&#8217;t notice that yesterday, but I bet she has</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">been sketching me all way through that class. She</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">hasn&#8217;t seen me yet - or decides to ignore me. Suits</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">me fine.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 552--><p class="noindent" >Other than that, the most remarking thing about
 the class was Mr DeMartino&#8217;s speech pattern. He
 emphasized syllables - and in unison his eye
 seemed to get a little bigger.
 <!--l. 559--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Either he&#8217;s a vet with an injury, or teaching at a</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">high school is really as bad as I always suspected it</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">was. Or both. But he isn&#8217;t half bad at teaching,</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">knows his subject and makes funny remarks.</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">Maybe we will get along after that sordid little</span>

 <!--l. 563--><p class="noindent" >Charles received the last lesson after the class
 ended, while everybody got up to head for the
 next class. He stood up as Daria was picking
 up her backpack from the floor. To his own
 amazement, the thought to goose her didn&#8217;t
 even cross his mind. This was not the third
 lesson. That was the mortal fear he felt when
 Daria erected herself about a foot away from
 him. Well over 6 foot tall and at least 180
 pounds of muscle she towered next to him, when
 the thought that she could have sat beside
 him for a reason crossed his mind. That she
 was the prototype of a female according to
 teachings of Barch. That she was likely out to get
 him.
 <!--l. 573--><p class="noindent" >He hightailed into the safety of the hallway and
 knew that his looks at Daria would match the
 looks Jane Lane gave her this morning.

 <!--l. 578--><p class="noindent" >The bell ended Daria&#8217;s first class at her new
 school. Things hadn&#8217;t been bad so far, but until
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
now she had been able to avoid most of her class
mates. It helped that she had arrived early and
that her homeroom had also been her first class.
She stood up and grabbed her backpack. The
students that just looked at her before now
became really interested, and the boy with curly
hair in Quinn&#8217;s color fled the room. It was likely
the guy that had run into her in the hallway
the day before. At least she wouldn&#8217;t have to
explain about her gender with these people,
her introduction by name had given that one
away.
<!--l. 587--><p class="noindent" >As she headed towards the door, the &#8216;QB&#8217;
approached her, accompanied by his girlfriend.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Hey, new dude, you look like football player
material. I see these things, because I&#8217;m the QB.
Are you going to try out for the team?&#8221;
<!--l. 592--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Your name&#8217;s Kevin, right? I&#8217;m Daria.&#8221;
<!--l. 594--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hi Daria. I&#8217;m Kevin, and I&#8217;m the QB! And this is
my babe, Brittany.&#8221;
<!--l. 596--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span

<span 
class="ecti-1095">stupid and/or slow.</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;I&#8217;m a girl, Kevin.&#8221;
<!--l. 599--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;So, when will you be trying out for the team?&#8221;
<!--l. 602--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Two. At least he does not try any high strung</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">pick-up lines on me. Anyway, this has to be</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">joke.</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;I will not try out for the football team, Kevin.&#8221;
<!--l. 605--><p class="noindent" >His girlfriend had eyed her throughout the
conversation. She had verified Daria&#8217;s gender. For
some reason, she did not seem to like the result
and spoke up.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Kevvie, she&#8217;s a girl. She can&#8217;t be on the team.&#8221;
<!--l. 610--><p class="noindent" >For the second time that day, Daria could not
resist.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;We&#8217;d have to shower together. Every day. You
would like that?&#8221;
<!--l. 613--><p class="noindent" >Kevin&#8217;s answer was instantaneous - he had not
spent a single thought on it.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Sure!&#8221;
<!--l. 616--><p class="noindent" >Brittany was not amused.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Kevvie! You just want her ... ooooooohhhhhhh!
Pervert! Impure-thoughts-haver! You have me and
still try... and she isn&#8217;t even a cheerleader...&#8221;    <br class="newline" />With that Brittany started to berate and swat
 Kevin out of the class room. Before they were
 through the door, Brittany looked over her
 shoulder and shot Daria a real nasty glare.
 <!--l. 625--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Game - set - match. This was so... unbelievable</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">that I can&#8217;t even be mad at him.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />Daria was a little baffled. That girl likely felt
 threatened by her. And not physically. Well, kind
 of, but not in the bad way. That did not happen
 often and made Daria feel pleased.
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">I&#8217;m such a mess. I like it when people hate</span>
 <span

 <!--l. 633--><p class="noindent" >Jane watched as Daria got up and moved towards
 the door, but was intercepted by Kevin. The
 comparison to &#8216;the QB&#8217; was impressive. She was
 taller, and while Kevin looked more muscular, she
 was. Jane&#8217;s artistic eye had no problem mentally
 subtracting the padding he was wearing. She took
 the opportunity to vanish from the class room
 while Daria was distracted by Kevin&#8217;s stupidity to
 make sure she would not talk to her. She simply
 wasn&#8217;t prepared to face her.
 <!--l. 640--><p class="noindent" >The last thing Jane saw from the hallway was
 Mack and Jodie approach Daria from behind.
 She had even Mack beat. And he on his own
 was impressive. Jane had no idea what Jodie
 did to keep him. If it wasn&#8217;t for her, the girls
 would line up all around the block for him to
 choose.

 <!--l. 649--><p class="noindent" >Daria turned around to find the black couple
 standing behind her, grinning widely. The boy,
 who had addressed her, spoke up again.
 <!--l. 652--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m Michael, but everybody calls me Mack.
 That&#8217;s Jodie.&#8221;
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
<!--l. 654--><p class="noindent" >Mack pointed at the girl beside him.
<!--l. 657--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hi Michael, hi Jodie. I&#8217;m Daria, but you know
that unless you slept through class.&#8221;
<!--l. 659--><p class="noindent" >Close up Michael was a nice view. Three inches
smaller than her, but with a nice build. His
obvious girlfriend Jodie was the perfect match for
him. She joined the conversation.
<!--l. 663--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;And that&#8217;s a bad idea around Mr. DeMartino. Hi
Daria.&#8221;
<!--l. 666--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Call me Mack, Daria. That was a really wicked
move to sick Brit on him. But I guess that won&#8217;t
work for me.&#8221;
<!--l. 668--><p class="noindent" >Daria was pleasantly surprised by the friendly
conversation with people who appreciated her
humor.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect it to work that well. And you
showering with Kevin isn&#8217;t a threat to Brit. I
hope for Jodie here.&#8221;
<!--l. 673--><p class="noindent" >Mack laughed. That girl was little hard to read,
but smart, witty and with a good sense of humor.
Jodie went to defend her man.
<!--l. 677--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Nah, I&#8217;m <span 
class="ecbx-1095">very </span>sure that it isn&#8217;t. Mack&#8217;ll have to
think of his own ways to get to Kevin.&#8221;
<!--l. 679--><p class="noindent" >Jodie blushed a little as she saw the tiny smirk
Daria directed at her. She had picked up the
implicit information that Jodie didn&#8217;t intend to
give.
<!--l. 683--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;m the captain of the football team, and this is a
hard job with him around.&#8221;
<!--l. 685--><p class="noindent" >Daria immediately saw the problem.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;No doubt about that. Sorry, but I need to get to
my next class. Math.&#8221;
<!--l. 688--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;We as well. And we...&#8221;
<!--l. 690--><p class="noindent" >The offer was clear to Daria, but this was much
too early to start to get chummy with other
students.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Sorry, I need to stop by my locker. We&#8217;ll meet up
there.&#8221;
<br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Jodie, you may be a nice girl, but you scream</span>
<span

<span

<span

 <!--l. 705--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Thanks Michael, that&#8217;s sweet.&#8221;
 <!--l. 707--><p class="noindent" >Jodie and Mack walked off in silence. Before
 they reached the class room, Mack spoke up
 again.
 <!--l. 710--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;She&#8217;s odd. But alright.&#8221;
 <!--l. 713--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;It&#8217;s going to take a while to get used to her. I
 have some mixed feelings about her.&#8221;
 <!--l. 715--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hmm, why?&#8221;
 <!--l. 719--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Mack, she&#8217;s an about 16 year old girl that
 is taller than you and likely outweights you
 - and not by additional fat. She&#8217;s smart as
 well. And that does not strike me as a healthy
 combination.&#8221;
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">I know what kind of girls you like. That glare</span>

 <!--l. 726--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No, Mack. But discretion is the better part of

 get all chummy with her.&#8221;
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">That girl will need some friends. Just friends.</span>

 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Hmm. We&#8217;ll see.&#8221;

 <!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >The math class was pleasantly unexciting. The
 teacher did welcome Daria, but did not try to
 single her out as Mr. DeMartino did. Of course he
 called on her to probe her level, but he seemed to
 be satisfied by a single correct answer. After
 the class a boy asked her how tall she was,
 and several students stuck around to make
 sure they overheard the answer. The boy was
 polite about it, and was not obvious about
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
looking her over. So Daria answered politely, and
left an awed crowd behind as she headed for
PE.
<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >Daria was a little anxious about PE. She wasn&#8217;t
bad at sports. She wasn&#8217;t afraid to change in the
locker room - what for? But the possible reactions
of the other girls could be... adverse. Well, time to
find out. Daria steeled herself, entered the girls
locker room and moved towards an empty spot on
the benches to change.
<!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;HEY YOU! THIS IS THE GIRLS LOCKER
ROOM!&#8221; screamed a girl that had faced away
from Daria as she passed by her and turned
around to identify the unfamiliar silhouette.
<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Three.</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Yep.&#8221;
<!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;GET OUT, GUY!&#8221; another girl joined in as
Daria started to turn back.
<!--l. 38--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Four. But I&#8217;m not sure if that really counts.</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Excuse me? I&#8217;m ...&#8221;
<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;GET OUT YOU DEGENERATED SICK
FREAK!&#8221; the first girl screamed again.
<!--l. 43--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Look, ...&#8221;
<!--l. 45--><p class="noindent" >The herd-like behaviour kicked in at full throttle.
Daria&#8217;s attempts of an explanation were drowned
out by the multiple exclamations of &#8216;Get Out!&#8217;,
&#8216;Pervert!&#8217;, &#8216;Get the coach!&#8217;, &#8216;Peeping Tom!&#8217; as
more and more girls joined in. Things started to
get really out of hand as Daria caught the first
soap bar that was flung at her. She started to get
agitated and knew that early venting would be
the best way to prevent a blow up.
<!--l. 52--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;M A FEMALE AND I AM REQUIRED
TO CHANGE IN HERE!&#8221; she roared at the
top of her voice. Reverberating from the tiled
areas of the locker room her words stood in
impressive contrast to the then ensuing silence.
Daria had to strain herself not to fling the
soap bar back at its owner. But she felt better
now.
<!--l. 58--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;What&#8217;s going on in here?&#8221; demanded Ms. Morris
into the silence as she hurried into the locker
room to investigate the ruckus. She spotted the
big girl standing in the aisle between two rows oflockers, and several of the other girls in different
 states of undress up the aisle trying to cover
 themselves up. She remembered Ms. Li&#8217;s short
 briefing. Two new girls, both tall; one lanky,
 Quinn, one muscular, Daria. No doubt, that was
 Daria. And her figure matched in shape the senior
 football players. Impressive.
 <!--l. 66--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;They&#8217;d like me to leave the locker room.&#8221;
 <!--l. 68--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;And why would be that, ladies?&#8221;
 <!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">You&#8217;ve been briefed, haven&#8217;t you?</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Ignorance, blindness, prejudices, general
 cluelessness?&#8221; offered Daria a little peeved. That
 was more hostility than she had expected.
 <!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" >Seeing Daria from the front, the realization slowly
 sunk in with the other girls.
 <!--l. 77--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;We thought...&#8221;
 <!--l. 82--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You thought wrong. I recommend verifying your
 assumptions before you start accusing next time.
 Unless you want to see Ms. Li for harassment,
 that is. Do I make myself clear, ladies? You&#8217;re
 Daria, right? Go change. And anybody late is
 going to do 10 additional laps.&#8221;
 <!--l. 84--><p class="noindent" >Ms. Morris left and the silence was replaced by
 a multitude of murmurs that merged into a
 constant background noise. Daria was sure she
 was the sole topic of all conversations, but
 also knew that there was no way to change
 that fact. She just headed over to the spot
 she had in mind right from the beginning,
 and started to change. None of the girls that
 started the ruckus made any attempt to offer an
 apology, but she could feel their stares as she
 started to undress. Jacket. Boots. Socks. Jeans.
 T-shirt. Switching bra and panties for something
 suitable for PE she put on her LHS PE uniform
 - the male version in XL size. She thought
 she had heard someone whistle, but couldn&#8217;t
 tell for sure. And if so, it was likely for the
 nasty bruise she had still on her back from her
 final training in Highland. But that didn&#8217;t
 matter.

<!--l. 100--><p class="noindent" >After coach Morris settled the things in the girls&#8217;
locker room, Jane retreated back into her corner
into the cover of the locker row. But Daria settled
down at the end of the bench that Jane just had
an unobstructed view on. Jane was already
changed, but instead of immediately heading into
the sports hall and getting some laps done Jane
opted for observation.
<!--l. 106--><p class="noindent" >Daria did not make a fuss but undressed
systematically. Without her clothes, her body had
a nice muscular tone without the obtrusiveness of
those body building types. Her waistline and hips
were not as prominent as usual with women, but
Jane was in no position to comment negatively on
that. A large ageing bruise was prominent on her
left shoulder blade.
<!--l. 114--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Did she get into a fight? There must be some</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">story to it... Did somebody just whistle? You&#8217;re in</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">for a disappointment; she likes boys. I know it</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">right from the horse&#8217;s mouth.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 116--><p class="noindent" >Daria wore a surprisingly nice set of bra and
panties. Jane had expected her to wear the
utilitarian sports underwear she put on for PE. To
her own amazement, Jane&#8217;s subtle feeling of
attraction to her did not diminish after having
Daria&#8217;s femininity on full display.
<!--l. 126--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">She&#8217;s female, no doubt about that. Compared to</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">her, everyone else in here is not just tiny, but also</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">just a girl. This really weirds me out a little.</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">And having her around in every other class</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">does not exactly help. At least she did get a</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">boys&#8217; size PE uniform. Smart move, I think</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">even the girls&#8217; XL would mean &#8216;bare midriff&#8217;</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">for her. And be as tight around her chest as</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">Brittany&#8217;s.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 128--><p class="noindent" >Jane stopped her observation and headed for the
hall before Daria noted her staring at her. That
would have been a very undesirable development.
<!--l. 131--><p class="noindent" >                                            <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-20000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 133--><p class="noindent" >After the scene in the locker room, the PE class
 was relaxingly uneventful. No girl wanted to do
 the back stretches with Daria, but that was for
 the good reason that none came even close to her
 height and weight. Ms. Morris filled in, but had a
 hard time lifting Daria.
 <!--l. 138--><p class="noindent" >Ms. Morris monitored Daria&#8217;s performance closely.
 She was strong. Her well toned muscles moved
 under her skin as she moved. Ms. Morris spotted
 a few girls looking more than necessary. She had
 endurance as well, but wasn&#8217;t a good runner due
 to her body mass. Her body coordination was
 quite good, and she was sufficiently flexible, but
 not exactly graceful. As expected, Daria was
 athletic, but not in any of the core activities of
 the class. Ms. Morris shuddered at the idea of
 what that kid would do in game of volley or
 basket ball among the girls. Or soccer.
 <!--l. 147--><p class="noindent" >Maybe she would have to deal with her similar to
 that Lane kid, who would purposefully piss her off
 to be sent off to run laps. This was a good
 deal for both parties. The Lane girl got to
 run - and she did not slack off at running;
 she could only be a half-Lane, at most - and
 stayed clear of Ms. Morris. Ms. Morris would
 have liked to forgo the pissing-off, but that
 ensured that nobody could get on her back for
 favoritism.
 <!--l. 154--><p class="noindent" >Ms. Morris was pleased to see that Daria was
 quite well versed in safety. Once assigned the job,
 she diligently and skillfully secured all girls during
 their jumps. She never lost the focus on the task,
 and Ms. Morris was sure that Daria would catch a
 falling girl - not just soften the fall by using her
 own body as padding, as the other girls did. That
 had potential.
 <!--l. 160--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;OK ladies! That&#8217;s it, hit the showers!&#8221; Ms.
 Morris dismissed the class, and found Daria
 heading straight towards her.
 <!--l. 163--><p class="noindent" >
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-21000"></a>*****</h4>
<!--l. 165--><p class="noindent" >Doing her laps, circling the entire gymnasium,
Jane watched Daria being directed through the
different exercises by Ms. Morris. She didn&#8217;t do
badly, but not exactly well either. That stuff was
obviously not up her lane. It was funny, though,
to see her &#8216;throw&#8217; a girl across the vaulting horse
that took too little startup while Daria was on
safety duty.
<!--l. 171--><p class="noindent" >After Ms. Morris dismissed the class, Jane
immediately headed for the showers. She&#8217;d
been running more than half an hour non-stop
and broken a nice sweat. She used the time to
think about exactly that: the shower. Daria
in the shower. And Jane reluctantly had to
admit to herself that she was looking forward to
it.
<!--l. 177--><p class="noindent" >She was a little crestfallen when Daria didn&#8217;t
show up.
<!--l. 181--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Is she too anxious to shower with the other girls</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">after what happened before and planning to stall</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">into the lunch break? She&#8217;s not shy per se, as</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">openly as she changed before class.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 183--><p class="noindent" >As Jane pondered, Daria walked into the showers
wearing nothing but flip-flops, her towel over her
right shoulder and the soap in her hand. She took
the first available shower, adjusted the much too
low shower head and cleaned herself. Jane&#8217;s eyes
nearly bugged out.
<!--l. 190--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">She did not even think about covering herself!</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">I&#8217;m not exactly modest, but I try to limit my</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">exposure. Shy and anxious? I bet she needs a</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">dictionary to look those words up.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 192--><p class="noindent" >Jane took her time under the shower to watch
Daria. She really enjoyed the show that came with
a clinical shower. She glanced at the other
girls in the shower. Some were scandalized
by her open display. Some seemed envious
about that athletic body. Others just awed
by its size. But some others seemed to enjoy
the show at least to Jane&#8217;s level. In general,
suspiciously few girls left the showers while Daria
was in there. Those who did, left in quite a
hurry.                                       <!--l. 202--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Girl, are you aware that this show will grant you</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">the star role in numerous upcoming squishy</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">lesbian wet dreams? You better write yourself a</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">sign: &#8216;I like boys&#8217;. No. &#8216;I like men&#8217;.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 204--><p class="noindent" >Jane inconspicuously left the shower as she saw
 that Daria was nearly done with her task, toweled
 herself and changed into her street clothes.
 The visual she had gotten during the shower
 would require several studies to process. Maybe
 she could do a first charcoal sketch during art
 class.
 <!--l. 209--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Damn. I hope those images won&#8217;t pop up in my</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">mind at the wrong time.</span>&#187;

 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-22000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 213--><p class="noindent" >Having PE just before the lunch break was a
 blessing that Daria knew to appreciate. After
 unloading her backpack into her locker she headed
 straight for the lunch room and queued for a
 lunch. With a laden try, she sat down at a
 sparsely occupied table that seemed to promise
 some privacy during her lunch.
 <!--l. 218--><p class="noindent" >Daria found her fear of the local cafeteria food
 confirmed. The food was plain bad. The soup was
 a salt lake. How does one manage to mess noodles
 up? The meat was either road kill or Soylent
 Green. The vegetables were ... recognizable as
 vegetables. Barely. Her father&#8217;s meals were a
 challenge, but better. And what was it with
 the meal that looked like leftovers from the
 day before? Daria was planning to give the
 food a try this week, and unless it improved
 dramatically, she would start to bring a boxed
 lunch.
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span

 <!--l. 227--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Is this seat taken?&#8221;
 <!--l. 229--><p class="noindent" >The voice woke Daria from her thoughts. The
 Ankh-girl was standing across from her with her
 tray in hand and pointed at the chair. Daria
 shook her head.
 <!--l. 232--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hi Daria&#8221; said the petite girl with the dyed red

<br class="newline" />&#8220;Hello Ms. Pennsylvania.&#8221;
<!--l. 238--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t give you my name yet. My name
is ... just call me Scarlett, as everybody else
does.&#8221;
<!--l. 240--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">I don&#8217;t care what your name is. Just do not make</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">puppy eyes at me.</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Enjoy your meal, Scarlett.&#8221;
<!--l. 243--><p class="noindent" >Providing an opportunity to stall any conversation,
Daria attacked her meal with new vigor. Scarlett
watched a while and ate herself a little.
<!--l. 248--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I realize you&#8217;re having a different selection than I
am, but I doubt your choice is so much better
than mine. What&#8217;s with the eagerness? Do you
want me to leave?&#8221;
<!--l. 250--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;It&#8217;s a free country.&#8221; Daria shrugged and continued
with her meal.
<!--l. 252--><p class="noindent" >Scarlett sensed Daria&#8217;s unwillingness to interact
with her.
<!--l. 255--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">You&#8217;re a tough nut to crack. But even if this is</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">going to take a while, from what I&#8217;ve seen in PE</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">this is so going to be worth the effort...</span>&#187;
<!--l. 257--><p class="noindent" >Daria and Scarlett ate in silence, each in her own
world, and did not care about the rest of the
lunch room. Silence was a state that suited
Daria. With the proper people, talking was just
not required. With the wrong people, it was
pointless.
<!--l. 262--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a

<!--l. 264--><p class="noindent" >Jodie sat across from Mack and ate her lunch
while retelling the events that led to the ruckus in
the girls&#8217; locker room before PE. Mack got a good
laugh out of it and returned the favor by telling
some of the even more stupid than usual antics
that Kevin performed during PE. Like pulling a
Tommy Sherman. Jodie decidedly did not tell
anything else about Daria. What she had seen
in the showers had her really worried. Daria    gave a very male first impression. But seeing
 her au naturel in the shower left no doubt
 that she was a healthy girl. Make that woman.
 Different from your usual expectations, but a
 woman all right. Mack did not need to know
 that.
 <!--l. 274--><p class="noindent" >Brittany sat with her fellow cheerleaders to gossip
 before hooking up with their respective boyfriends
 (or not) from the football team. Part of the gossip
 were the new girls, obviously. Daria was found to
 be a girl, and a shameless one at that. Even the
 cheerleaders had their limits when it came to
 handling a razor. Otherwise her body was a
 failure. Muscles all over, and unless naked hard
 to distinguish from a guy. Brittany&#8217;s initial
 assessment of her was found to be wrong. No
 healthy guy would go for a girl like her, but the
 lesbians would be all over her. And most likely
 she would fit in perfectly with that bunch,
 given how she was sitting with the petite red
 head that made, very discreetly, puppy eyes at
 her.
 <!--l. 285--><p class="noindent" >The tall red head was another deal. She was just a
 freshman and only two weeks into the year
 there weren&#8217;t any freshman on the squad yet,
 so the gossip was severely limited. She was
 tremendously cute, tall and mature for being a
 freshman. All guys - not just the freshman - really
 enjoyed looking at her. But her size was also her
 weak spot. Hardly any boy could approach
 a girl like her without getting dwarfed. The
 verdict was, that she was likely to stir up the
 popular circles (she had been seen hanging
 around with the Fashion Club!), but was no
 threat to the cheerleading squad. At least not
 yet.
 <!--l. 294--><p class="noindent" >
 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a

 <!--l. 296--><p class="noindent" >Quinn&#8217;s classes progressed slowly but steadily.
 The chairs at LHS were seriously small for a
 person of her size, and unless she extended her
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
legs way under the chair in front of her, she
was really cramped. She shared many of her
classes with at least one of the girls from that
Fashion Club. She was not sure if they made
potential friends. That Sandi girl was incredibly
snotty.
<!--l. 302--><p class="noindent" >Quinn quickly learned about the groups at high
school; they weren&#8217;t that different from the ones
at middle school. There were jocks from the
teams, who associated with the cheerleaders and
the other popular people. The &#8216;involved&#8217; students.
The nerds and geeks that stuck to themselves.
Skaters. Metal heads. Punks. Stoners. Well, those
were new compared to middle school, at least in
their abundance. Goths. All those had found their
friends and were integrated in a group, even the
freshman.
<!--l. 310--><p class="noindent" >Transferring schools just two weeks into the
term was really a bad time. People had just
made new acquaintances and were too busy
converting them to friends to have time to
care for some new arrivals. Quinn had seen
the outcasts, who stuck to themselves. They
could be a large group, but just didn&#8217;t interact.
Quinn was sure that this was the not-group that
Daria would join. She had her own agenda and
would welcome the solitude. Daria was like a
leopard. She needed her freedom and walked
alone. And Quinn knew she was capable of
sleek movements that simply betrayed her
frame.
<!--l. 319--><p class="noindent" >Quinn, however, was like a bunny. Maybe a huge
bunny, but a bunny nevertheless. A life like that
was her worst nightmare. It would kill her. Very,
very slowly and painfully. Her mom would be
on her back, her dad would be clueless, and
Daria would neither see nor understand her
problem. Quinn knew she wouldn&#8217;t make friends
immediately, but she could not allow herself to
wait too long before acting. Maybe those Fashion
Club girls, they knew about dating, and fashion
and...
<!--l. 327--><p class="noindent" >She was aware of the stares she got. Much more
than in middle school. The students talked abouther without including her. Some girls and boys
 asked about her size, and she saw some bills
 being passed around after her answer. Daria
 would so fit into this. Not a single boy made
 an attempt to really talk to her. That really
 sucked.
 <!--l. 333--><p class="noindent" >At least her teachers gave her much leeway and
 didn&#8217;t single her out. She was new at high
 school and had missed two weeks. But that was
 going to be temporary. Quinn was glad that
 she had a capable and willing tutor at call.
 Daria.
 <!--l. 338--><p class="noindent" >Daria seemed to have made an impact as well.
 There was gossip about a new guy, likely senior,
 that looked as a perfect addition to the football
 team. And since Quinn knew there was no
 such guy among the group of new arrivals, she
 was sure that someone had mistaken Daria -
 again.
 <!--l. 343--><p class="noindent" >PE class would settle that rumor. And like a
 hydra&#8217;s heads there would be three new rumors
 in an instant. Quinn was not happy about
 that. Daria didn&#8217;t like attention. She would be
 moody. Quinn would have to plan in order to
 minimize her stay at home during the upcoming
 weekend.

 <!--l. 351--><p class="noindent" >After her previous experience in the self-esteem
 class with Mr. O&#8217;Neill Daria was not happy with
 him being her English teacher as well. While
 English was her favorite subject, a teacher like
 him had the potential to ruin it permanently for
 her. Her hope was that his intellectual capacity
 would not limit him to reciting paragraphs from
 &#8216;Shakespeare for dummies&#8217;, as it did in that darn
 self-esteem class. Otherwise she would have to
 consider a hipflask with some serious drink to
 fast-forward through his class.

<!--l. 360--><p class="noindent" >She was relieved that the focus on her had
dropped a little once she was in the classroom.
Most of the people in this class had seen her in
one of the previous classes that day, so her novelty
had worn off. Jodie and Mack were in the class as
well as Brittany and Kevin. Daria set off to
occupy an arbitrary seat, but as she passed
Jodie&#8217;s first row seat on the way, the black girl
spoke up.
<!--l. 367--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Ah, Daria, please don&#8217;t take just some random
seat.&#8221;
<!--l. 369--><p class="noindent" >Confused, Daria stopped and faced Jodie. Her
decidedly neutral voice let Daria answer in the
best monotone she could muster.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Why that?&#8221;
<!--l. 373--><p class="noindent" >Jodie was not comfortable around Daria. History
and PE had shown that the girl had brain

classes.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;O&#8217;Neill needs a seating chart.&#8221;

goes with it.&#8221;
<!--l. 380--><p class="noindent" >Jodie and Mack gave a little chuckle at her
comment, but to Daria Jodie&#8217;s sounded forced.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;There is no way that he&#8217;s going to mistake you
for someone else. The original occupant of the
seat however...well, let&#8217;s say I just don&#8217;t want to
have to prompt for him all the time.&#8221;

<span 
class="ecti-1095">you?</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />Daria shrugged and headed back to the door. She
noted that the Lane girl was in the class as well,
and she busied herself with her sketchpad while
ignoring the world around her.
<br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Hmm, maybe writing through class is an option.</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">At least it&#8217;s more approved than getting drunk.</span>

<!--l. 393--><p class="noindent" >Daria sat in the chair next to the door waiting for
Mr. O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s arrival until its original occupant
showed up. Being primed by Jodie, she willingly
vacated the seat and leant to the wall next to it.
She used the waiting time to observe her class
mates. The ankh-girl, Scarlett, was in this class aswell. The rest of her class mates were rather
 nondescript. A girl in a goth-type outfit caught
 her eye; she wore a single glove.
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span

 <!--l. 402--><p class="noindent" >Daria&#8217;s observation was interrupted when Mr.

 His eyes went a little wide as he spotted her, but
 that was the limit of his reaction. If he was
 nervous all the time to begin with. Putting
 his notes on the desk, he surveyed the class,
 squinted at his seating plan, and made a note on
 it.
 <!--l. 409--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hello class, we have a new student in our English
 course, Miss Darla Morgendotter.&#8221;
 <!--l. 412--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Daria. Delta-Alpha-Romeo-India-Alpha. Morgendorffer.
 Mike-Oscar-Romeo-Golf-Echo-November-Delta-Romeo-double
 Foxtrot-Echo-Romeo.&#8221;
 <!--l. 414--><p class="noindent" >Mr. O&#8217;Neill squinted at his notes again. &#8220;Hm,
 sorry, yes, Daria. Please take the empty seat over
 there. Class, please make Daria feel welcome.&#8221;
 <!--l. 417--><p class="noindent" >Daria made her way to the indicated seat in the
 back at the classroom. The pattern to sit her in
 the back in order for her not to obstruct the view
 of any possible students behind her was obvious.
 She hoped that her eyes would keep up with
 it. Even with glasses her vision was less then
 stellar.
 <!--l. 423--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;And as she has missed the first two weeks of
 classes, she would surely hugely appreciate if
 someone could give her some pointers about the
 ...&#8221;
 <!--l. 425--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;&#8216;Tiny appreciation&#8217; simply seems impossible&#8221;
 someone said and provoked a laughter from the
 class and a groan from Daria.
 <!--l. 428--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No, what I mean is if someone would be
 large-hearted enough to ...&#8221;
 <!--l. 430--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;&#8216;Small hearted&#8217; won&#8217;t do either! No way!&#8221; More
 laughter from the class.
 <!--l. 433--><p class="noindent" >Daria wasn&#8217;t sure whether to laugh or cry. The
 jokes were on her, but also on Mr. O&#8217;Neill
 and not exactly mean. And that teacher was
 just...
 <!--l. 436--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Class, I mean if someone could spend a tiny
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
amount of...&#8221;
<!--l. 438--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I don&#8217;t think &#8216;tiny&#8217; is going to work!&#8221;
<!--l. 440--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Class. Quiet please, class. You all know what I&#8217;d
like you to do.&#8221;
<!--l. 442--><p class="noindent" >It took a while, but the class got calmed down.
<!--l. 446--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Well, then let&#8217;s start with the lecture. We&#8217;re
currently looking at the poems of Shakespeare.
Daria, to welcome you to the class I&#8217;d like you to
read one of the great sonnets ...&#8221;
<!--l. 448--><p class="noindent" >Suppressed giggles filled the room as Daria picked
up her textbook and recited the poem that Mr.
O&#8217;Neill assigned.
<!--l. 451--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-26000"></a>*****</h4>
<!--l. 453--><p class="noindent" >English turned out to be another class that Jane
shared with Daria. She was briefed by Jodie about
Mr. O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s quirks. Those two seemed to get
along just fine. After the class started and
Daria had again ended up in the back row,
Jane was ready to sketch all the way through
the class. The laughter at Mr. O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s size
references - and Daria&#8217;s size - was amusing. Daria
seemed to take it well. Jane had the distinct
feeling that Daria had gotten quite a lot of
teasing during her life. She stuck out, and the
hammer usually hits the nail that sticks out
most.
<!--l. 462--><p class="noindent" >As Daria read the poem, Jane was again
mesmerized by her voice. Yes, her reading was
rather monotone, but she didn&#8217;t make a single
mistake and brought the rhythm (what was the
proper term for it again?) of the sonnet out the
right way. Her voice had a soothing quality to
Jane, but she did recall the incident in the locker
room. Ouch.
<!--l. 468--><p class="noindent" >Somehow, Daria&#8217;s voice did not match her
body, but Jane could not tell why she felt that
way.
<!--l. 471--><p class="noindent" >                                            <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-27000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 473--><p class="noindent" >The self-esteem class was unremarkable. Daria
 had been early again, but this time chose a seat in
 the back row. After the second teacher asked her
 to stay in the back in order to give the other
 students an unobstructed view to the board, she
 did so automatically. The &#8216;QB&#8217;, who wasn&#8217;t
 exactly small and always wore his padding, was
 seated in the front row in every class he shared
 with Daria. If Mack was present, he was seated
 right beside him. Obviously Mack and the
 teacher were required to keep the Kevin in
 line.
 <!--l. 481--><p class="noindent" >Sitting in the back had its perks, as it gave her a
 good view of her fellow students. It did not take
 long to figure out who belonged into what clique.
 At least the social structure of LHS did not differ
 too much from her old school. That Lane girl
 shared several classes with Daria, but went miles
 to avoid her.
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">I wonder what is with her. I think I was</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">quite friendly with my reply, must be her</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">disappointment.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 489--><p class="noindent" >Interestingly, she did not belong to the jock group
 as Daria initially suspected, but seemed to be one
 of the outcasts that no group would have. Or that
 would have no group. Her way of dressing fit that
 way as well. Interestingly, the Coach had sent her
 running laps quite early in PE. That had looked
 pretty much like some extra time for track team
 training.
 <!--l. 495--><p class="noindent" >When Lane entered the self-esteem class, just before
 the bell rang, Daria observed her systematically
 looking for her - in order to chose a seat that
 brought the biggest distance between the two
 girls. Afterwards, Lane immediately immersed
 herself into drawing.
 <!--l. 500--><p class="noindent" >Sitting in the back of classes had also its
 drawbacks. Besides Daria&#8217;s bad eyesight, that
 made the board a little hard to read, there
 were the &#8216;less interested&#8217; students that stuck to
 the back of the classroom as well. And their
 continuous chatter and antics irritated Daria a
 little, but at least there were no brain dead idiots
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
like Beavis and Butthead around. The goth
with the fishnet glove had stuck in the back
as well, and as she was silent during class -
neither snoring nor chatter - Daria had seated
herself next to her as often as possible. They
hadn&#8217;t exchanged a single word and hardly a
look, which suited Daria fine - and the goth as
well.
<!--l. 510--><p class="noindent" >The self-esteem class passed by Daria in a blur,
and she only took sparse notes to be able to
identify the used books later on. The school
library was not likely to stock them, the local
library neither, but with OPAC and remote
borrowing that was not a real problem.
<!--l. 515--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a

<!--l. 517--><p class="noindent" >After school, the Fashion Club met up for an
additional strategy meeting.
<!--l. 519--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;So, Stacy, what can you report from your survey
of the current gossip?&#8221;
<!--l. 522--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Well, the usual rumors revolving around
who-dates-who and so on are currently just
background noise. The two new girls are the main
topic.&#8221;
<!--l. 525--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;So, Stacy, would you like to elaborate. And
please stick to our main problem. Quinn.&#8221;
<br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">My main problem will be dealt with later.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 531--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;It seems like we&#8217;re currently among the students
best informed about Quinn. Our talk before
school was about the longest she had with a single
group all day. We witnessed her in class by
ourselves, she&#8217;s ok, but not brainy.&#8221;
<!--l. 533--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Stacy, something new, please.&#8221;
<!--l. 537--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;The talk among the guys is ambivalent; everybody
is awed by her presence and consider her a
major hottie. I quote: &#8216;I know what image
will be on my mind this evening when I&#8217;m
...&#8217;&#8221;
<!--l. 539--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;STACY! EW!&#8221; &#8220;EWWWWWWWW! Thaaat&#8217;s
grossssss!&#8221;
<!--l. 542--><p class="noindent" >Despite the offensiveness of Stacy&#8217;s words,     Sandi did not dare to ignore the facts that they
 conveyed.
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">That development was somehow to be expected.</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">As long as this is only a temporary effect due to</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">her novelty, it&#8217;s all right. Permanent however...</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 547--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Sorry, Sandi, but that was ...&#8221;
 <!--l. 551--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No member of the Fashion Club should say such
 things. Even if it was verbatim. You better not
 even think about such things. Do you need a
 week&#8217;s worth of fashion sabbatical to sort your
 thoughts out?&#8221;
 <!--l. 553--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No! NO! Sandi, I was just giving you an
 accurate...&#8221;
 <!--l. 556--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Do so, but please bear the statutes of the
 Fashion Club in mind while doing so. Go on.&#8221;
 <!--l. 559--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Well, the boys think she&#8217;s hot, but so hot that
 she seems unapproachable.&#8221;
 <!--l. 561--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Exactly as I predicted!&#8221; Sandi said, smug.
 <!--l. 567--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;There is another very important piece of
 information that I got from Heather that overheard
 Quinn talking to Jodie Landon. Quinn rebuffed
 any participation in clubs and extracurricular
 activities with reference to her part time job
 as a model. Between that, homework and an
 occasional date she just has no time.&#8221;
 <!--l. 569--><p class="noindent" >This information had an impact on Sandi like a
 Daisy Cutter. That girl did not only look like a
 model, she <span 
class="ecbx-1095">was </span>a model. That changed things
 completely. Just observing and manipulating
 every now and then would not be sufficient to
 control her popularity. Every circle would be
 falling over themselves to get her as a member.
 That had the potential of serious trouble in the
 long term. Sandi made an ad-hoc decision.
 Quinn was unwilling to become a member of
 any activity. But likely she would give in and
 join a club to stop the whining. One club.
 And that would be the Fashion Club. That
 called for some serious scheming. She did not
 expect any suitable help from Tiffany, and the
 danger of Stacy being a leak outweighed her
 usefulness.
 <!--l. 583--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;This is an important development. Maybe she
 will be able to provide us with some contacts.
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
Even if she just models for the local copy shop,
the photographers are usually well networked.
Stacy, try to get any additional information on
that topic. Anything else?&#8221;
<!--l. 589--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yes Sandi, I&#8217;ll try to. What&#8217;s next? Ah, for the
rumor of Quinn being, well, you know, as said by
the girls that had been next to her in the PE
locker room, this seems to be true. Her sister is,
well, so too. And that has been verified by every
sophomore girl that shares PE with Daria. Daria
is said to be even, hmm, less self-conscious than
Quinn.&#8221;
<!--l. 591--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I heaaaard you could see eeeveryyything.&#8221;
<!--l. 594--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Everything, I&#8217;d really like to see... crap, that is</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">an image that I really don&#8217;t need in my head right</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">now. Get a grip, Alexandra!</span>&#187;
<!--l. 597--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;That gave Daria an instant recognition among
the girls who, well, do not like boys.&#8221;
<!--l. 603--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;So Daria could be a lesbian, but at least she&#8217;s a
slut. Maybe Quinn is too. But I doubt the two of
them can exploit their lewdness with their
repulsive bodies. We cannot entrust the Fashion
Club&#8217;s popularity standing on the possibility of
Quinn having cheerleader morals. We&#8217;ll have to
have a close eye on her. Do I make myself
clear?&#8221;
<!--l. 605--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yes Sandi&#8221;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Yesss Sandiii&#8221;
<!--l. 609--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I think it would be wise to wait for Quinn
tomorrow morning to trick her into talking
to us, just as she did today. OK? Meeting
adjourned.&#8221;
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >
<h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-29000"></a>*****</h3>
<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >The smell reached Daria as soon as she opened
the door to her home. Her father had kept his
promise and had taken care of the dinner by
conducting some chemical experiment with the
intent of creating some stew. Daria announced
herself and got an answer from her father. Her
mother waved at her from the living room, whereshe had spread several files on the table and was
 busy talking on her cell phone. Quinn was not
 to be seen. Daria went into the kitchen, and
 immediately started to set the table, as it wasn&#8217;t
 prepared.
 <!--l. 24--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hey kiddo, good you&#8217;re back! I made some stew.
 How&#8217;s that self-esteem coming?&#8221;
 <!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Kiddo my ass.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Brilliant. I got mistaken for a guy six times
 today. That does wonders for one&#8217;s self-esteem.
 You owe me a twenty.&#8221;
 <!--l. 30--><p class="noindent" >Daria picked up Jake&#8217;s wallet from the sideboard,
 presented it to him, and at his nod removed two
 ten dollar bills in his sight, which she pocketed.
 <!--l. 34--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Ah, kiddo, that sucks. People just don&#8217;t see what</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">a sweet little girl you are.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;That&#8217;s not nice, but you haven&#8217;t run into any
 real trouble so far, have you, Daria?&#8221;
 <!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No. Actually, it&#8217;s better than I expected. Having
 Quinn around distributes all the attention
 between the two of us. I just don&#8217;t know how she
 can like it.&#8221;
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">And the head cheerleader seems to see me as a</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">threat in regard to her bozo boyfriend. No matter</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">how stupid that is, it delights me in a wicked</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">way.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 45--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;She is just the way she is. She can&#8217;t have enough
 attention. Here, try the stew! I tried an old secret
 recipe from military school!&#8221;
 <!--l. 48--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;If she takes my share, I&#8217;ll do her chores for a
 week. A month. The stew is ok dad, stay clear of
 any additional spices.&#8221;
 <!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" >Daria immediately made contingency plans:
 Distract Jake, insert potatoes, let them simmer a
 bit, extract potatoes before Jake notices, hope for
 the best, and serve.
 <!--l. 55--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Dad, you&#8217;ve already cooked. I&#8217;ll take over, you go
 and get mom and Quinn.&#8221;
 <!--l. 57--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Thanks! I&#8217;m on my way!&#8221;

was rounded up at the table, and the stew was

<!--l. 68--><p class="noindent" >Helen and Quinn held back a little until Jake and
Daria swallowed the first spoon of the concoction,
and after seeing no adverse reaction started eating
by themselves.
<!--l. 73--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;It&#8217;s good, Jakey. Hot, but not too hot, one can
still taste the ingredients.&#8221;
<!--l. 75--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Well, then &#8216;kiss the cook&#8217;!&#8221; Jake said and
presented his cheek to his wife.
<!--l. 78--><p class="noindent" >Quinn looked at Daria who rolled her eyes as her
father got what he wanted. Quinn had the inkling
that Daria had somehow intervened to ensure
the edibility of their dinner. The kitchen was

otherwise.

carry their sizes. And they asked me to join the
pep-squad, but ...&#8221;

rather bland, and listened to his little girl tell

with which Quinn settled in at high school.
<br class="newline" />&#171;<span

<!--l. 148--><p class="noindent" >Helen encouraged Quinn to keep going by asking
a question every now and then, but even Quinn
ran out of news after a while. So Helen shifted her
focus to her other daughter.
<!--l. 152--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;How about your day, Daria?&#8221;
<!--l. 159--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Some weird girl hit on me before I even reached
school grounds. My history teacher either hates
me or just wanted to test me. &#8216;The QB&#8217; asked
me to try out for the football team. I nearly
got kicked out of the girls&#8217; locker room before
PE. I&#8217;m afraid I have an admirer, ah, make
that an admireress. I hope she gets &#8216;NO!&#8217; and
isn&#8217;t the persistent type. I really hate that
situation.&#8221;
<!--l. 161--><p class="noindent" >Compassion and weariness filled Helen&#8217;s soul. Did
Daria manage to get into trouble on her first real

<span

<br class="newline" />&#8220;What happened in PE?&#8221;
<!--l. 169--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Some girls hadn&#8217;t seen me before and mistook
me for a guy. The coach calmed things down. I
think most of them had to see the complete
evidence before they felt safe.&#8221;
<!--l. 171--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Any problems in your PE class, Quinn?&#8221; Helen
shifted her focus on her other daughter.
<!--l. 176--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;m not any good at it, but you know that. And
getting sweaty is just gross. But to answer your
question: Some of the girls were surprised, but no
Miss goody-two-shoes started to call me names or
something.&#8221;
<!--l. 178--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Ah, girls, those stuck-up kids just don&#8217;t know
what is good.&#8221; Jake chimed in.

<span

<br class="newline" />&#8220;Daria?&#8221;
<!--l. 186--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I think nobody really noticed - they were busy
looking at the rest of me. And if: I&#8217;m a freak   anyway.&#8221;
 <!--l. 189--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Should they start giving you trouble, tell them
 the truth. If they won&#8217;t stop...&#8221; Helen did not

 <!--l. 192--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;The other girls are going to be so jealous
 that we never have to shave our legs...&#8221; Quinn
 smirked. Daria decided to divert from the current
 topic.
 <!--l. 197--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I asked the PE coach about the school&#8217;s gym
 today. There are two-hour &#8216;girls only&#8217; slots on
 Tuesday and Thursday after school. I&#8217;m going to
 attend this Thursday after that self-esteem class,

 <!--l. 203--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Of course Daria. And Quinn will accompany you.
 She needs to keep up with her physiotherapy
 exercises. A &#8216;girls only&#8217; class is perfect for that.&#8221;

 You can&#8217;t do that to me!&#8221;

 <!--l. 218--><p class="noindent" >Jane took another sip from her soda.
 <!--l. 223--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;PE was ... strange. When she came into the
 locker room, some girls that hadn&#8217;t seen her
 before mistook her for a guy and made a ruckus.
 Coach Morris came in and calmed them down.
 After changing there was no more doubt she&#8217;s a
 girl. The shower after PE really got to me.&#8221;
 <!--l. 225--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;
 <!--l. 229--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t hide herself. I got a realllly good
 glance at her ... and I really liked what I saw.
 She&#8217;s all hard but soft at the same time. Nice and
 smooth movements. God, this is so disturbing.&#8221;
 <!--l. 231--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;So you like a girl.&#8221; Trent said and shrugged.
 <!--l. 235--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No. That&#8217;s not the point, Trent. I like that body.
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
And that&#8217;s ok. But I&#8217;m not sure if I like it because
it belongs to a girl or in spite of it belonging to a
girl. Damn.&#8221;
<!--l. 237--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Does it matter?&#8221;
<!--l. 239--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yes! To me it matters!&#8221;
<!--l. 241--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Ooooook....time for a little diversion.</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;And what do the other girls think?&#8221;
<!--l. 246--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;How should I know Trent!? Am I a mind reader?!
Ah, sorry, I&#8217;m ... She&#8217;s intimidating. Her physique,
I mean. Strong and agile, but totally sucks at
gymnastics.&#8221;
<br class="newline" />Jane laughed a little and fished her sketchbook
from her backpack.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;So much like a guy. Look at these sketches.&#8221;
<!--l. 250--><p class="noindent" >To Trent said sketches initially looked the same as
the ones yesterday. But on the second glance he
noted a slight difference in proportions. The greek
athlete was now a female. And wore glasses,
giving the picture a surreal feeling.
<!--l. 257--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Those should be pretty accurate. I had a good
look at the original in its natural state. Her
jacket conceals a lot when you look at her from
behind.&#8221;
<!--l. 259--><p class="noindent" >Trent was tempted to ask Jane about the
accuracy of those sketches. But implying that
Jane took artistic liberties when she claimed
she hadn&#8217;t was bad practice, so he remained
silent.
<!--l. 263--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I wonder if I can get her to model for me...&#8221;
<!--l. 265--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;That would require asking her. You didn&#8217;t talk
to her all day?&#8221;
<!--l. 267--><p class="noindent" >Trent meant it more as a statement than a
question. He knew his little sister.
<!--l. 269--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No! No way! I don&#8217;t have the nerve to talk to
her!&#8221;
<br class="newline" />Jane got agitated.
<!--l. 272--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;What&#8217;s so difficult, Janey?&#8221;
<!--l. 274--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I mistook her for a guy. And I want her body!&#8221;
<!--l. 276--><p class="noindent" >Trent grinned widely. That was very honest. And
most likely unintentional.
<!--l. 278--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;What now, Trent?!?&#8221;
<!--l. 280--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;If I had ever said that....&#8221;
<!--l. 282--><p class="noindent" >After two seconds, the color of Jane&#8217;s face
approached the hue of her jacket. His sister was embarrassed, on at least two accounts. Trent
 didn&#8217;t press on, but had an idea how to help her a
 little - in the long run.
 <!--l. 286--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Janey, how would you feel if some girl mistook
 you for a guy?&#8221;
 <!--l. 288--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I ... that must suck. Crap.&#8221;
 <!--l. 290--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Maybe an apology would make you feel better
 about this as well.&#8221;
 <!--l. 292--><p class="noindent" >As Jane didn&#8217;t answer he knew she had some
 thinking to do. He picked up his soda and headed
 for the basement. Trent could nearly touch the
 blues Jane emitted. Blues. Open-D tuning. Hmm.
 Maybe he could get a good song out of this
 situation.

 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a

 <!--l. 299--><p class="noindent" >Later that evening Daria went downstairs to make
 a call. The internal phone wiring was still faulty,
 so the phone in her room didn&#8217;t work. Not that
 she would need it as often as Quinn already did
 hers.
 <!--l. 303--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;m calling about my training classes.&#8221; Daria
 announced to her parents as she picked up the
 phone. She read the number from a Post-It and
 keyed it in. After the fourth ring, somebody
 picked up.
 <!--l. 307--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Reynolds speaking.&#8221; was about the answer Daria
 was expecting.
 <!--l. 310--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hello Mr Reynolds, my name is Daria Morgendorffer,
 we just moved in from Highland,Texas, and...&#8221;
 <!--l. 312--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;So you&#8217;re Tiny.&#8221;
 <!--l. 314--><p class="noindent" >Daria heard the smile in the man&#8217;s voice and
 couldn&#8217;t help but smile herself. She could still
 remember how she had gotten that nickname
 during her first training. She was a short, fragile
 kid back then, when Helen had made the girls
 attend those classes with her. Quinn was already
 taller, and that didn&#8217;t sit too well with Daria. She
 hated being mocked and called names at school
 because of her size.
 <!--l. 321--><p class="noindent" >But when the 6&#8217;something 190+pound ex-marine
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
teaching those classes named her Tiny, he did so
for a very good reason and with no ill intent:
compared to him she simply was, and of course
she was the smallest participant to begin with.
That nickname stuck, even as she grew, and she
had come to like it for the memories that were
attached to it. Memories of her being a much
more normal kid that could just blend in if she
had to. She wasn&#8217;t sure if those times had been
happier, but they hadn&#8217;t been as bad as as they
seemed then.
<!--l. 329--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yeah, that would be me.&#8221;
<!--l. 332--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Buzzcut told me to expect your call. He was
right on that one. You&#8217;d like to join the classes, I
suppose?&#8221;
<!--l. 335--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yes, I got used to them. It is really a pity that
I&#8217;ll have to commute to Oakwood, you&#8217;re sure
there are no classes at Lawndale?&#8221;
<!--l. 337--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Sorry, really not. Is this going to be a problem?&#8221;
<!--l. 339--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to work something out with my
parents.&#8221;
<!--l. 341--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Maybe you can carpool with somebody from
your area.&#8221;
<!--l. 343--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Sounds like a good idea. When and where are the
classes?&#8221;
<!--l. 347--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;We currently meet four times a week. Monday,
Thursday, Friday and Sunday at 7pm, usually &#8217;til
10. Many people have other things to do on
Friday evening, so it&#8217;s mostly the &#8216;enthusiasts&#8217; on
that day.&#8221;
<!--l. 349--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hmm, Thursday is a little short term. Where do
you meet on Friday?&#8221;
<!--l. 353--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;The parking lot of the Tellerman office complex
on the side of the highway to Middleton. One of
the security crew is a student as well. We&#8217;re in the
city green Sunday and Monday after.&#8221;
<!--l. 356--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Parking lot. Ouch. But I think I can make that.
See you on Friday, Mr Reynolds.&#8221;
<!--l. 359--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No pain no gain...See you, Tiny. And I&#8217;m really
curious how much of the description Buzzcut gave
me was part of his imagination...&#8221;
<!--l. 361--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll see for yourself. Bye!&#8221;
<!--l. 363--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Bye!&#8221;
<!--l. 365--><p class="noindent" >Daria jotted time and location on the Post-It thatdid hold the phone number. Getting a ride this
 Friday was doable. A regular ride would be
 difficult. She would have to put some serious
 thought in the carpool idea. Buzzcut had been
 right. She had the feeling she would fit in this
 group as well.

 <!--l. 372--><p class="noindent" >As Daria passed Quinn&#8217;s room, her sister opened
 her door and called for her.
 <!--l. 374--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Ah, Daria, it&#8217;s you. Could you give me some
 hints for my reading?&#8221;
 <!--l. 376--><p class="noindent" >After dinner and watching a little TV downstairs
 Quinn had retreated into her room to work
 on the books on her reading list, which was
 the most time consuming aspect of changing
 schools.
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">If you haven&#8217;t read those books on your own,</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">anyway.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 381--><p class="noindent" >Daria turned and followed Quinn into her room.
 Daria wondered if permanent exposure to those
 colors could cause ocular cancer.
 <!--l. 384--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;So...?&#8221;
 <!--l. 386--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I finished another one of those Shakespeare
 thingies. It&#8217;s...&#8221;
 <!--l. 388--><p class="noindent" >Quinn held up her school issued copy of
 &#8216;Shakespeare, selected pieces&#8217; and sat down again
 at her desk, facing Daria. Getting extra high
 desks and chairs had been a real pain, but
 was a necessity. For a while Daria had to use
 bricks under her desk&#8217;s legs to heighten its
 top.
 <!--l. 394--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;... well, I understand this weird language now, I
 get what is going on, but...&#8221;

 <span 
class="ecti-1095">Good.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;That&#8217;s nice, but what&#8217;s more?&#8221;
 <!--l. 404--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I keep forgetting things. It does not fit in my
 head anymore. That was about the fiftieth
 boring drama with boring people and weirdo
 language that I&#8217;ve read and it&#8217;s, like, all the
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
same in my mind! One large blot of pointless
mumbo-jumbo! Even that stupid guy ran out of
titles and just numbered the junk. Doesn&#8217;t he
know that one starts with one - and not with two
or four?&#8221;
<br class="newline" />The frustration was palpable in Quinn&#8217;s voice.
<!--l. 407--><p class="noindent" >Inwardly Daria smiled. Quinn was paying the
price for an easy summer. Betting on cramming
was a bad choice, but Quinn had made it. Now
she had to deal with the consequences.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;And you want my help to forget the &#8216;mumbo-jumbo&#8217;?
Sorry, I don&#8217;t do brain surgery.&#8221;
<!--l. 413--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Haha, Daria. I need to know that junk.&#8221;
<!--l. 415--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I don&#8217;t implant knowledge either.&#8221;
<!--l. 417--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;But you must help me!&#8221;
<!--l. 420--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No, I cannot remember things for you. That&#8217;s
something you&#8217;ve got to do on your own.&#8221;
<!--l. 423--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Daria, I just can&#8217;t. Help me here. Please. If I
come home with a &#8216;D&#8217; essay mom&#8217;s going to be so
pissed off. You don&#8217;t want that either.&#8221;
<!--l. 425--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a point there.&#8221;
<br class="newline" />Daria contemplated how to help Quinn. To skip
out of helping her was not an option; one word to
their mother, and Helen would raise hell. Daria&#8217;s
eyes were on Quinn, but out of focus while she
was lost in thought.
<!--l. 430--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Soo...&#8221; Quinn asked, and watched Daria return
from orbit.
<!--l. 432--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;OK. I&#8217;ll help you. Let me have a look at your
notes.&#8221;
<!--l. 434--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Notes?&#8221;
<!--l. 436--><p class="noindent" >Daria did not the like the surprised look on

<!--l. 439--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;ve read them. I didn&#8217;t take any notes.&#8221;

<br class="newline" />&#8220;Quinn, that&#8217;s...&#8221;
<!--l. 446--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m supposed to read the books on the
reading list! That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing!&#8221;
<!--l. 450--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;True. But being on the <span

ban taking notes on the texts. And if you keep
forgetting things, you obviously should have takennotes.&#8221;
 <!--l. 452--><p class="noindent" >Quinn was a little bit embarrassed and felt stupid.
 The thought to take notes while reading had not
 once crossed her mind. She had been proud that
 she was forcing herself to do the reading, but her
 brainy big sister immediately had put her back in
 her place.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;So, what now?&#8221;
 <!--l. 458--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You look at the texts again, and take some notes.
 Then we can talk.&#8221;
 <!--l. 460--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;m not reading that junk <span

 <!--l. 463--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to. Quickly browsing through
 them should be enough to recall the main points.&#8221;
 <!--l. 465--><p class="noindent" >Quinn looked unhappily at her issue of &#8216;Shakespeare,
 selected pieces&#8217; and came up with another way
 to end this quick. She put on her pleading
 face.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Would you give me your notes?&#8221;
 <!--l. 470--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span

 <br class="newline" />&#8220;No. And that is solely because only taking your
 own notes will really help you remember.&#8221;
 <!--l. 474--><p class="noindent" >Daria had put her arms akimbo during that
 sentence, and this told Quinn that the last word
 on that matter had been spoken. Likely she was
 right. Unhappy, she put the book back on the
 desk and mourned the hours she would waste
 taking her own notes. But then Daria would help
 her. She got up from her chair and faced her
 sister.
 <br class="newline" />
 <!--l. 480--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I don&#8217;t like that, but you&#8217;re probably right.
 Thank you Daria.&#8221;
 <!--l. 482--><p class="noindent" >Quinn stepped over to her sister and hugged
 her. Quinn could use a hug, her first whole
 day at high school was a bigger strain than
 she had let on. High school was even more
 of a war zone than middle school had been.
 Getting out of there unscathed would be much
 more difficult to her than to her self-reliant
 sister. Most things just ricocheted off of her
 armor.
 <!--l. 488--><p class="noindent" >Daria was a little surprised, but returned the hug
 willingly. She liked being hugged, because it made
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
her feel so trustworthy. But her experience
thaught her never to initiate a hug on her own.
That made some people uncomfortable - for
obvious reasons. As nice as being hugged by
Quinn was, it always brought up some bad
thoughts. She had stopped in her growth, but
Quinn was taller. Again. She could never be a
proper &#8216;big sister&#8217; to Quinn. And holding her
sister&#8217;s delicate body always remembered her of
her own messed up figure. Quinn was tall, but had
all the right curves of a woman. Long firm legs, a
creamy white complexion with just the right
amount of freckles that were a natural red
head&#8217;s trademark. Quinn was so soft. Her looks
provided Quinn with a lot of attention, but she
just basked in it. Daria would not be really
comfortable with it, but at least it was good
attention. At least compared to what she herself
got.
<!--l. 502--><p class="noindent" >As Daria returned the hug heartily, Quinn felt
immediately better. Daria&#8217;s arms around her
made her feel so protected. Strong, but loving.
Daria may be a little smaller than her, but
outweighed her by about twenty-five pounds and
thus was her BIG sister. She always had been.
Quinn remembered the one time when she had
thrown a fit about a year ago and tried to
lunge at Daria. She had felt like a rag doll
during the eyeblink that it took Daria to pin
her on the floor. Luckily Daria was not angry
at her and just waited until she had calmed
down.
<!--l. 511--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;It&#8217;s all right Quinn, you&#8217;ll catch up soon.&#8221;
<!--l. 513--><p class="noindent" >Daria ended the hug, and Quinn took a step away
from her.
<!--l. 515--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I hope so, I don&#8217;t like all that additional
studying.&#8221;
<!--l. 517--><p class="noindent" >Quinn took another look at her sister in her
orange shirt and jeans. Daria was strong in mind
and body, which Quinn was not. The people
admired Quinn as they would admire a piece of
artwork, but people respected Daria. On first
sight for her physique, but soon after for her
mind. That respect was worth so much more thanall the shallow attention she got.
 <!--l. 523--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Anything else? I need to finish some things
 before I go to sleep.&#8221;
 <!--l. 525--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No, that&#8217;s all. Thank you again.&#8221;
 <!--l. 527--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No problem. Later.&#8221;
 <!--l. 529--><p class="noindent" >Daria left Quinn&#8217;s room to return to her own,
 and Quinn sat down at her desk again. Her
 view fell on the dreadful book again, but her
 mind was not set to contemplate the works of
 Shakespeare. Her future at LHS seemed to loom
 over her.
 <!--l. 534--><p class="noindent" >
 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-36000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 536--><p class="noindent" >Daria returned to her room in a better mood than
 before. Seeing Quinn interested in more useful
 things than fashion gave her hope that her sister
 would not turn out as a living display dummy.
 Her mother&#8217;s move to tie Quinn&#8217;s modelling jobs
 and classes to her academic standing obviously
 provided a strong motivation. The hug she got out
 of it was a nice bonus. Quinn felt for some reason
 unknown to Daria safe around her, but Daria
 would not complain.
 <!--l. 543--><p class="noindent" >Daria closed her door, and &#8216;accidentally&#8217; knocked
 her backpack over in such a manner that any
 attempt to open the door would hit it and cause
 enough noise to make her notice. Daria grabbed
 her diary from its obvious hiding spot behind
 some other books in her shelf and started to write
 the entries for the day before and the present
 day.
 <!--l. 549--><p class="noindent" >New school with a power mad principal, visit at
 the shrink who did not like her question about
 the last shooting rampage at that institution.
 Being sentenced to a freak class with a teacher
 who seems to be permanently on drugs. Being
 propositioned by two total hotties (for, but of
 wrong, sex) and one total dumbass (for football).
 A beer on Monday evening, unpacking her stuff.
 The history teacher with the pneumatic eye. The

P.E. Having talked about the local venues to
hold black celebrations with that girl during
lunch. Her dad&#8217;s failed attempt at stew. A
shot of H for dessert. A little bonding with
Quinn.
<!--l. 560--><p class="noindent" >Daria powered her computer up, and while the
machine booted, she stored the diary in its new
old spot that no snoop would miss. The bait was
laid out again. She then logged onto the machine,
extracted her personal data from the family video
(last Christmas, courtesy of Jake) it was hidden
in, decrypted it and opened her journal. After
finishing the two missing entries, encryption
and re-embedding the data into the video she
lamented the missing internet connectivity due to
the defect internal cable and phone lines. She had
to make sure that they would be fixed ASAP, or
some work around like a wireless connection was
installed. She&#8217;d have to talk to her dad about
that.
<!--l. 570--><p class="noindent" >

<!--l. 572--><p class="noindent" >Her father told her that he wanted to look into
the cable problem by himself before calling an
expert.
<!--l. 576--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s just a loose connection we can fix
ourselves and save some money.&#8221;
<!--l. 578--><p class="noindent" >He was going to be too busy during the week
and thus planning the investigation for the
weekend. Daria decided to wait until then and she
would make sure to assist her father. In other
words: monitor him, to ensure that he would
connect neither the phones nor himself to the
mains.
<!--l. 583--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Could you give me a ride to Oakwood on Friday
evening, dad?&#8221;
<!--l. 585--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Friday? To Oakwood? Why?&#8221;
<!--l. 587--><p class="noindent" >Jake was suddenly very interested.
<!--l. 590--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;My self-defence classes. There are none in
Lawndale, and the Friday evening class at      Oakwood seemed best to me to start with.&#8221;
 <!--l. 593--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Your class, I remember, you said something
 along those lines. When is it on Friday?&#8221;
 <!--l. 595--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Starts at 7.&#8221;
 <!--l. 597--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I think I can, but I have to check. Can I tell you
 tomorrow?&#8221;
 <!--l. 599--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Sure, dad.&#8221;
 <!--l. 601--><p class="noindent" >With a &#8216;Gotta make some calls!&#8217; and a wicked
 gleam in his eyes her father left, mumbling to
 himself. He was definitely up to something.
 <!--l. 604--><p class="noindent" >Daria wished she was already allowed to drive on
 her own. That would solve that problem, she&#8217;d
 just have to bum a car.
 <!--l. 607--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span

 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a

 <!--l. 611--><p class="noindent" >Daria was in the bathroom brushing her teeth as
 Quinn entered as well. Daria finished up, and
 made room for her sister.
 <!--l. 614--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Quinn, before you start, can you give me a hand,
 please?&#8221;
 <!--l. 616--><p class="noindent" >Daria held some ointment jar out for Quinn to
 take.
 <!--l. 618--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Your back?&#8221;
 <!--l. 621--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s alright, but I want it completely healed
 before I start my training again.&#8221;
 <!--l. 623--><p class="noindent" >Daria removed the old baggy t-shirt that she
 wore.
 <!--l. 626--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Ouch. Nice coloring. Mostly green-yellowish with
 a tad of teal. I was already wondering why you
 were wearing that thing.&#8221;
 <!--l. 628--><p class="noindent" >Quinn started to rub the salve onto her sister&#8217;s
 shoulder, admiring her muscles.
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span

 <!--l. 632--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t want to ruin anything else.&#8221; Daria
 elaborated.
 <!--l. 634--><p class="noindent" >The ointment created a pleasant coolness on
 Daria&#8217;s back. Quinn was careful, and did not rub
 hard enough to cause any aches.
 <!--l. 637--><p class="noindent" >Quinn saw an opportunity and seized it.

compensation.&#8221;

<!--l. 649--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No. I wasn&#8217;t thinking of money. During the move
I saw you have a book on massage...&#8221;
<!--l. 651--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Ah, crap...</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Quinn, all I did was read a book on the subject.&#8221;
<!--l. 655--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me you don&#8217;t want to try it out. If
you want me to nurse your back this week,
you owe me a nice back massage the coming

<!--l. 679--><p class="noindent" >Daria reached for the bruise. She was barely able
to touch the spot, but in no way to efficiently
apply the ointment. Quinn smiled at Daria&#8217;s futile
contortions. She was in for a nice and relaxing
back massage.                               <!--l. 683--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Damn. You win. But I can&#8217;t make any promises.&#8221;
