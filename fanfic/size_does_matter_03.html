 <!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" ><a

 <!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >Daria had not slept well. Sleeping in a shirt really
 annoyed her. That thing was contorted all
 around her and pinched her in inappropriate
 places.
 <!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" >As she got ready for the day, she packed some
 fruits to have a backup in case of &#8216;surprisingly&#8217;
 bad cafeteria food. Anything else was routine, and
 she did things on auto pilot, but remembered that
 there was neither PE nor training that day, so
 there were more options for undergarments. Her
 mother left the house as she went down for
 breakfast, and so she quickly shared the paper
 with her dad. After finishing off her meal and
 drinks, she cleaned her place. Her sister came
 downstairs and did not even bother to sit down
 as she ate some fruits. Daria considered the
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
upcoming evening.
<!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Dad, you&#8217;re preparing dinner again?&#8221;
<!--l. 32--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Ah, no kiddo. I&#8217;ve a tightly packed schedule
today. But I was planning to pick up some
take-out on the way home. How does Chinese
sound?&#8221;
<!--l. 34--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Kiddo my ass.</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Chinese isn&#8217;t bad. If you find a restaurant
that does not serve dog as pork and rat as
chicken.&#8221;
<!--l. 38--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Ewww, Daria. That&#8217;s so gross.&#8221;
<!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >Jake grinned and shook his head at his older
daughter&#8217;s humor.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;There&#8217;s a restaurant with take-out near the office
park. They have a lunch buffet, and I saw several
of the people from the park walk over there to
have lunch. It can&#8217;t be that bad. And they have a
cheery name: &#8216;Good times&#8217;. That has such a nice
upbeat ring to it.&#8221;
<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Could be the name of a roadhouse with an inter
dimensional portal on the backside that serves
you dragon for beef. Real dragon.&#8221;
<!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Haha, very funny, Daria. Maybe they have
an opening as dragon slayer you could do as
a part time job. Ah, no, I forgot, you can&#8217;t.
You have to get out of the self-esteem class
first.&#8221;
<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Thank you for reminding me, Quinn.&#8221;
<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Girls, please. I&#8217;ll get Chinese, and I&#8217;ll get your
usual, unless you want something else.&#8221;
<!--l. 58--><p class="noindent" >Daria and Quinn shook their heads. Daria
wondered whether there was a real Texas style
BBQ around. A place where you got decent meat,
with a sauce that contained the owners pride,
sweat and blood, no cutlery but a bib, and paid
your meal by the pound. Beside the temperature,
that was one of the things Daria was going to
miss.
<!--l. 64--><p class="noindent" >Daria walked the shortcut to school through the
park and the residential areas. That should save
her some minutes and embarrassing moments
with irritated female convertible drivers. But it
did not save her from the need for a warmer
jacket for the winter.                         <!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" >
 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 71--><p class="noindent" >Charles&#8217; week sucked big time so far. He had
 arrived early at the school, not to gawk at the
 girls, as usual, - these three freshman girls that
 hung around every morning were some real eye
 candy - but to make sure to steer clear of her. He
 had had some business at the office after school
 yesterday and had used the opportunity to
 ask about the other tall girl that had arrived.
 After some flirting with the secretary, she had
 spilled the name, Quinn, and that her sister had
 transferred in as well.
 <!--l. 79--><p class="noindent" >He hadn&#8217;t had all the facts clear at that time, so
 he did not immediately make the connection.
 When he did, he didn&#8217;t like the outcome. Quinn
 was her sister. And Quinn was befriending those
 three cute freshman girls. High school had become
 a very hostile environment for the Ladies&#8217; man
 Charles Ruttheimer III.
 <!--l. 84--><p class="noindent" >
 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 86--><p class="noindent" >The carrot-top next to Daria in home room was
 decidedly early, pale and nervous today. Daria
 didn&#8217;t know of any upcoming tests that early
 into the year, so this was most likely for a
 different reason. She shortly contemplated offering
 him a mechanical valium, but he seemed in no
 condition to appreciate that joke. Luckily, he
 calmed down once Mr. DeMartino entered
 the room. Poor sap, whatever his problem
 was.
 <!--l. 93--><p class="noindent" >
 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" >Classes were uneventful. Kevin asked her again to
 try out for football, and she was not sure whether
 he was really that stupid or if he was trying to
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
make fun of her. Latter was unlikely, as this would
require higher brain functions. At least that
Brittany girl was civil and just greeted her, which
Daria politely returned.
<!--l. 101--><p class="noindent" >The black girl, &#8216;Jodie&#8217; she recalled, approached
her between classes.
<!--l. 106--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Daria, I know you have not completely settled in,
but may I interest you in some of our clubs?
Beside the sport clubs, there are the usual ones
like yearbook and the school paper. We also have
a mathletics and debate team, and the drama
club does plays. Or maybe you&#8217;d rather work in
the student council?&#8221;
<!--l. 111--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Look Jodie, you said yourself that I haven&#8217;t
settled in properly. Beside that I have the honour
to take this fine institution&#8217;s &#8216;self-esteem&#8217; class
for the next three and a half weeks. Between
that, my other activities, and school work I do
not see any time to join a club. At least right
now.&#8221;
<!--l. 113--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;The frea...aeh, self-esteem class? How did you
end up there?&#8221;
<!--l. 115--><p class="noindent" >Daria just shrugged.
<!--l. 117--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You don&#8217;t have low self-esteem.&#8221;
<!--l. 119--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Tell that to the school shrink. Gotta get going.
See you.&#8221;
<!--l. 121--><p class="noindent" >Watching Daria&#8217;s retreating form, Jodie
contemplated that information. Daria was different,
all right, that was clear to see. She seemed smart,
was generally polite but terse, and she mainly
kept to herself. Weird kid. Jodie wondered shortly
if Daria had any friends at all, but dismissed the
thought quickly. Jodie had too many problems of
her own to get involved with other peoples&#8217;
lives.
<!--l. 128--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-6000"></a>*****</h4>
<!--l. 130--><p class="noindent" >After the initial shock, Stacy was rather
comfortable around Quinn. She seemed a rather
nice person. She didn&#8217;t flaunt herself. Well, she
did, but not intentionally and not into the     other girls&#8217; faces. She was so superior in that
 department that she did not need to compete. At
 least at LHS. And Quinn did not scold her if she&#8217;d
 start to ramble, or to talk nonsense, as Sandi
 always did. She just told her to focus.
 <!--l. 137--><p class="noindent" >Quinn&#8217;s fashion sense was superb. Stacy started
 to understand that once Quinn had told her
 about the content of her closet. She had to work
 with very little clothing because getting more was
 difficult, expensive, and pointless. Quinn did not
 buy new clothes to accommodate fashion, but her
 growth. Under those circumstances dressing the
 way Quinn did was a special feat.
 <!--l. 143--><p class="noindent" >Quinn and Stacy used the time before their class
 to talk. Without Sandi&#8217;s presence, Quinn was able
 to have a normal conversation with Stacy and
 learned about the trio&#8217;s history. Sandi obviously
 had had her good sides before, and Quinn
 contemplated how good Sandi&#8217;s good side must
 have been that Stacy was willing to put up with
 the abuse from Sandi&#8217;s bad side. She came
 to no conclusion and decided to change the
 topic.
 <!--l. 150--><p class="noindent" >Getting a description of that &#8216;Jane Lane&#8217; out
 of Stacy was not difficult, but it was a little
 vague. Neither popular nor a jock. A sophomore
 wearing a red jacket most of the time. But that
 would likely be good enough to locate her,
 and then that gal would be given the talk she
 deserved.
 <!--l. 155--><p class="noindent" >Stacy became suspicious. Why was one of the top
 tier students interested in a student of the
 anonymous masses? Did she know something
 about that Lane girl that nobody else did?
 <!--l. 159--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;What&#8217;s your concern with her?&#8221;
 <!--l. 161--><p class="noindent" >Quinn just shrugged.
 <!--l. 163--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;She&#8217;s hanging around with my sister and I want
 to see what she&#8217;s like.&#8221;
 <!--l. 165--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Daria has already found somebody? That&#8217;s</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">news.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Hmm. Lanky. Black hair. And I remember her
 wearing some chunky boots. I think she considers
 herself an artist.&#8221;
 <!--l. 169--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s enough to find her.&#8221;
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
<!--l. 172--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;What is it with your sister anyway? I mean,
you&#8217;re both tall, but besides that...&#8221;
<!--l. 175--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Careful, Quinn. That&#8217;s likely going to be all over</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">school in a jiffy.</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Daria was ill, and that is a long term adverse
reaction to the meds she got.&#8221;

<!--l. 182--><p class="noindent" >Stacy&#8217;s mind was immediately busy building
worst case scenarios and her eyes welled up.
Quinn noticed the onset of sobs - Stacy was quite
emotional - and started to comfort her.
<!--l. 188--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Stacy, calm down. Besides being the way she is,
Daria is all healthy. All we can do is deal with it,
and we can talk about this topic. Ignoring it
would make things worse.&#8221;
<!--l. 190--><p class="noindent" >Quinn looked into Stacy&#8217;s eyes to give her the
opportunity to look for a lie. There was none,
and thus Stacy found no betrayal and calmed
down quick enough to enter the classroom on
time.

<!--l. 196--><p class="noindent" >Ms. Barch anticipated her sophomore science
class with the other Morgendorffer girl. From
the rumors that billowed through the faculty
lounge, she was even more impressive than her
younger sister. At least on second sight. And
Mr. DeMartino attested her &#8216;deceiving looks&#8217;,
whatever that meant for that weirdo.
<!--l. 202--><p class="noindent" >Considering the looks of her sister, seating this
girl in the back of the classroom would be
very necessary, as all those lechers would be
thinking of was how to use her, abuse her,
and drop her like hot coals after sweeping her
accounts. She used the silence of the empty
classroom to review the new seating chart when
she noted an unfamiliar male silhouette at the  door.
 <!--l. 208--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You!&#8221;
 <!--l. 210--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Ms. Barch, I presume?&#8221;
 <!--l. 212--><p class="noindent" >Ms. Barch took a closer look and found her
 suspicion refuted.
 <!--l. 214--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s me. You&#8217;re Daria Morgendorffer?&#8221;
 <!--l. 216--><p class="noindent" >Ms. Barch barely kept her composure as this
 Morgendorffer stepped up to her. Besides the
 glasses, the facial features clearly indicated the
 relationship between the sisters. Their size was
 another indicator. However, in terms of figure the
 girls could hardly be more different. While Quinn
 was dainty Daria was simply massive. She looked
 mature enough to be a college freshman. Now Ms.
 Barch had an idea what Mr. DeMartino meant.
 He may be male, but he was right on that
 point.
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Female on all accounts. And what a fine specimen</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">of the supreme gender! I can hardly wait for</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">her to show up in my &#8216;Take Back the Night&#8217;</span>
 <span

 <!--l. 227--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Right.&#8221;
 <!--l. 229--><p class="noindent" >Ms Barch continued to hand the textbooks to
 Daria and showed the girl to her seat. Daria sat
 down and took a look at the textbooks. They
 were in a bad condition, well worn from many
 generations of students.
 <!--l. 234--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">I wonder if this biology book is current enough</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">to mention DNA and genetics - or stops at</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">Mendel.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 236--><p class="noindent" >Daria watched as the students filed into the class
 and noted that Ms. Barch assigned several to
 different seats. She had obviously adjusted
 the seating to accommodate her, but the
 seating pattern was odd. There was a clear
 gender-segregation. Male and female students sat
 in distinct blocks, the male to the front and
 center, the female in the back and to the sides.
 Boys and girls never sat in adjacent seats - there
 was always at least one unoccupied seat between
 the groups.
 <!--l. 245--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">What&#8217;s that supposed to mean? We&#8217;re not</span>

<!--l. 247--><p class="noindent" >Daria noted the dull look on the face of her male
classmates entering the class. Odd.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a

<!--l. 252--><p class="noindent" >Jane was dead tired. After her conversation
with Trent in the evening she had thought
what effects her actions would have on Daria.
She didn&#8217;t like the conclusion she reached.
Avoiding Daria was rather selfish. She would have
to face the music and apologize. And better
fast, since procrastinating wouldn&#8217;t do any
good.
<!--l. 258--><p class="noindent" >She had decided to do so after the self-esteem
class, that would provide more privacy than any
other time throughout the day that she and Daria
met. And gave her some additional time to think
about what to say. At least, it seemed, her
attraction to Daria was declining. Certain facts
were slowly arriving at her subconscious. Jane
knew that she would not have been able to utter a
single word to Daria if she was still crushing on
her.
<!--l. 265--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">I can&#8217;t remember if I was ever that disturbed</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">before.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 267--><p class="noindent" >She managed to look Daria in the eyes before
science class without mad blushing and other
suspicious behavior. That was some real progress.
<!--l. 270--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-9000"></a>*****</h4>
<!--l. 272--><p class="noindent" >Walking towards the lunchroom Daria reflected on
the progress of the science class. There was no
doubt that Ms. Barch had some real gender
issues. She had not missed a single opportunity to
talk derogatory about everything male - even
making some seriously far fetched associations.
The boys sat there like statues. No chatter. No
notes - taken or passed. No hands risen on
questions. Petrified by the Medusa&#8217;s gaze. There
was no chatter among the girls either, but Dariasaw a note or two being passed about. Ms. Barch
 would rant at any boy that she asked to answer a
 question, no matter whether the answer was
 correct or not. Girls answering the questions were
 praised - again regardless of the quality of the
 answer. Wrong answers would, however, be
 corrected in patience; as long as given by a
 girl.
 <!--l. 284--><p class="noindent" >Unless Ms. Barch was a rape victim - and she
 seemed much too aggressive for that - Daria could
 come up with just a single event that could have
 turned that woman into a psychopath: bitter
 divorcee.
 <!--l. 288--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span

 <!--l. 292--><p class="noindent" >Dawn walked over to the pair of girls at the end of
 the lunch table. She moved her headphones down
 to her neck to have a real conversation. The girls
 looked up from their lunch at her approach and
 looked at her. Dawn saw recognition in the
 girls&#8217; eyes, as she shared some classes with
 them.
 <!--l. 297--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hi. You&#8217;re Daria?&#8221;
 <!--l. 299--><p class="noindent" >The big girl nodded.
 <!--l. 302--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;m Dawn, and I&#8217;m the public relations officer of
 Lawndale High&#8217;s &#8216;Rainbow Society&#8217;, that&#8217;s
 the...&#8221;
 <!--l. 304--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;... local gay and lesbian association, right?&#8221;
 <!--l. 306--><p class="noindent" >Dawn was a little put back by the blunt
 interruption. The petite girl across from Daria
 seemed to perk up a little, but Daria&#8217;s expression
 was no-nonsense - at best. Dawn nodded.
 <!--l. 314--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Ok then, Dawn, I have something I&#8217;d like you to
 publicly relate to all members of your &#8216;Rainbow
 society&#8217;. I won&#8217;t become a member because I&#8217;m
 not a lesbian. I&#8217;m not even bisexual. And I
 would really appreciate it if your members
 would take my word for it and save me and
 them the hassle of making passes at me. Got
 that?&#8221;
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
<!--l. 316--><p class="noindent" >Sudden pain shot through Scarlett&#8217;s heart. Her
well-developed crush turned out to be permanently
unavailable. She started to understand why
Daria had been so abrasive towards her. A
straight girl with her looks would have been hit
on by lesbians quite often, and thus have a
sophisticated gaydar. Scarlett felt her eyes well up
and shot towards the bathroom to save her
dignity.
<!--l. 322--><p class="noindent" >Daria watched her exit with an uneasy feeling.
<br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Ah, crap, exactly as I thought.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 325--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Uh, so you like guys.&#8221;
<!--l. 328--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Guys, and only guys. I&#8217;m positive on that. And I
tell you my life would be easier if I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;
<!--l. 330--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You got hit on by a lot of girls?&#8221;
<!--l. 332--><p class="noindent" >That was more a statement than a question.
Dawn knew that if Daria was into girls, she would
have the free choice among most club members.
And that did include the girls that were currently
attached. With a strong, taut body and a nice
soft face she had a killer appeal. One of the
girls had eyed her in the shower after PE and
used the word &#8216;spectacular&#8217; to describe the
view.
<!--l. 339--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Girls who are looking for a girl as well as girls
who are looking for a boy. That gets old rather
fast until it becomes just annoying.&#8221;
<!--l. 341--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;And what is it with your friend?&#8221;
<!--l. 345--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;My friend? Ah, her. She ain&#8217;t exactly a friend of
mine. Likely a potential member for your society
that just got some unpleasant facts shoved into
her face.&#8221;
<!--l. 347--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Oh.&#8221;
<!--l. 350--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Go recruit her. And do me a favor and spread
the word so that this won&#8217;t happen again. At
least not as often.&#8221;
<!--l. 352--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Ah... ok, I&#8217;ll do that. See you.&#8221;
<!--l. 354--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Bye Dawn.&#8221;
<!--l. 356--><p class="noindent" >The conversation had left Daria without any
appetite. The way Scarlett had acted proved her
suspicion about her motives right. Daria looked at
her tray, the tray Scarlett had left, stacked them
together and returned both before going into the
school yard to get away from everything - at leastfor a while.

 <!--l. 364--><p class="noindent" >Sandi left the toilet stall and headed for the
 sinks when she saw her. Her jacket was off,
 hanging over her backpack sitting on the floor
 while she was cleaning her hands. Her muscles
 shifted under the thin orange T-shirt she was
 wearing. Sandi was mesmerized and simply
 stared.
 <!--l. 369--><p class="noindent" >Daria finished her business and started to pick up
 her belongings as she saw the girl from the
 convertible staring at her. She stared back for a
 moment, but the girl did not react. Daria spoke
 up.
 <!--l. 373--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget to blink. That&#8217;s bad for the eyes.&#8221;
 <!--l. 375--><p class="noindent" >Her voice brought Sandi back to reality, and she
 realized that the girl, Daria was her name, Sandi
 remembered, was already done and had spotted
 her staring.

 <!--l. 389--><p class="noindent" >Jane walked into the class room for the self-esteem
 class at about the last minute before the class
 started. With her art class just before, she was
 always a little late. She spotted Daria in her
 &#8216;usual&#8217; seat around the center of the room and set
 her plan in motion. Therefore, she chose a seat to
 Daria&#8217;s left, that gave her the option to intercept
 the other girl before she left the class. She would
 talk to her then.
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
<!--l. 396--><p class="noindent" >Jane noticed Daria looking at her as she entered,
and even if their eyes hardly locked, Jane again
noticed some embarrassment. But she had her
feelings sorted out - at least a little better than
Monday evening. Daria was attractive, but she
did not feel attracted to her. Well, at least not in
that sense. The girl was an outcast like her, who
merely reacted to people. Jane had never seen
Daria interacted with anybody. She was brief, but
always curt. She did not cut anybody down
- at least not verbally, as far as Jane could
tell - but would likely not put up with any
crap.
<!--l. 405--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Maybe a kindred soul.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 407--><p class="noindent" >The class passed, but at the end Jane&#8217;s courage
left her and she could not bring herself to
apologize to Daria. The memory was still too
fresh, her inner thoughts were still too much in
turmoil. She would talk to her tomorrow. For
sure.

<!--l. 414--><p class="noindent" >The Fashion Club plus Quinn met up after school,
but Quinn did not stay longer than necessary to
exchange some basic pleasantries. This Sandi
Griffin would take a while to get used to and she
had still too much school work to do to make
up for having missed the first two weeks of
classes.
<!--l. 419--><p class="noindent" >Once Quinn was out of earshot, Stacy relayed her
latest information.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;I think that Daria girl has already met someone.&#8221;

out of the gossip network.&#8221;

 <!--l. 444--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Stacy, would you please look at the facts and
 not let your admiration for that Quinn girl
 distort your thoughts. There was the incident at
 lunch and now <span

 Supposing your information is reliable, what do
 you make of it?&#8221;
 <!--l. 446--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Well, it would seem as if that could have
 happened.&#8221;
 <!--l. 448--><p class="noindent" >Sandi was a little surprised that Stacy did not
 doubt her information on Daria being with that
 art chick. That was potentially dangerous, as
 Sandi hadn&#8217;t heard the slightest hint at that
 development.
 <!--l. 452--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Where did you get that, anyway.&#8221;
 <!--l. 455--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Quinn asked me who Jane is. Because Jane was
 hanging around with Daria, she said.&#8221;
 <!--l. 457--><p class="noindent" >Tiffany looked up from her compact as she
 contemplated Stacy&#8217;s statement, but remained
 silent. Sandi noted the implication as well, but
 was not sure if Stacy&#8217;s behaviour would justify a
 scolding for treachery.
 <!--l. 462--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;So, that seems to be a rather reliable source.
 Contributing to the conclusion&#8217;s reliability:
 She&#8217;s a slut. Even you should get that now,
 Stacy.&#8221;

 she had given hundreds of times before.

 id="x1-14000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 469--><p class="noindent" >The evening was uneventful. Her dad brought the
 Chinese take-out, her mother was late, the
 homework dull. Catching up with the school work
 was not a problem either, and Quinn did not
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
bother her. Daria tried to write a little, but her
mind was not into it. The move and the situation
at school gave her too much to think about. Too
many people were staring at her, talking to and
about her, and concentrating their attention on
her.
<!--l. 476--><p class="noindent" >Daria thought back to the time when she could
just blend in. Unless she had wanted to, hardly
anybody had noticed her. She had been able do
as she pleased without being under constant
scrutiny. Given, constantly being mistaken for a
much younger girl had not pleased her at that
time. And being small and brainy had made her
the target of some mockery, but people had left
her alone in general. Life had been simpler back
then.
<!--l. 484--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">It&#8217;s funny. Back then I wished I was taller, now I</span>

<span

<!--l. 486--><p class="noindent" >Daria contemplated watching some TV, but
remembered the defective cable connection. The
remote in her hand, she sat on her bed and stared
at the blank TV screen and replayed the day&#8217;s
events. The conversation during lunch struck her
most. Not the fact that the lesbians had tried to
recruit her, that was kind of a given. But the way
Scarlet had reacted. She had hurt somebody
without even trying. Again.

<span

<!--l. 495--><p class="noindent" >No longer having to share a room with her her
sister was the highlight of the move. Quinn was a
busybody and just too noisy for Daria&#8217;s taste.
Blocking her out was really hard from time to
time. But the padding on the room&#8217;s walls
topped it all. Initially installed to prevent the
schizophrenic woman living in the room from
injuring herself, it also provided excellent sound
dampening. Daria had the suspicion that the
latter had been more than a coincidental side
effect. It was a pity that they had to replace the
door, as now the sounds of the hallway were
clearly audible.
<!--l. 505--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span

 at 8, but I can amuse myself at the mall until
 then.&#8221;

 <br class="newline" />&#8220;That&#8217;s a ... pleasant coincidence.&#8221;
 <!--l. 546--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;For sure, so I can give you a ride and promote
 business! But please don&#8217;t tell your mom, she
 doesn&#8217;t need to know that I work late as well and
 hates those &#8216;old boys&#8217; networks&#8217;.&#8221;

<!--l. 553--><p class="noindent" >Her father left with a nod, closing the door. She
went through her evening hygiene on automatic as
she would do in the morning and contemplated
whether it was possible to go through three more
years of high school that way. With a sufficient
supply of booze and dope she could give herself
a nice street lobotomy. But she neither had
that kind of money, nor was that a long-term
solution.
