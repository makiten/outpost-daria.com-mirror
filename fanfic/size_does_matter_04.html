 <h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-2000"></a>Part 4</h3>
 <!--l. 18--><p class="noindent" >Thursday was a drag. Getting up and ready
 including a breakfast was a quick affair, Daria&#8217;s
 and Quinn&#8217;s mother had already left for work.
 Daria was starting to share her father&#8217;s uneasy
 feelings concerning Helen&#8217;s workload. Quinn was
 rather busy catching up with school work and
 hence a little morose.
 <!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >Both girls used the shortcut through the park to
 school, and given the cold temperatures around
 that time of the year in Lawndale, Daria was
 rather motivated to get back indoors ASAP.
 That instantly reminded her that - as much as
 she hated to do it - she&#8217;d have to do some
 clothes shopping before autumn turned into
 winter, and scheduled that some time next
 week.
 <!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >Home room was boring, and the announcements
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
held nothing of Daria&#8217;s interests. Her classmates
did her a major favor and just left her alone.
History was fun in its own way. Besides being
among Daria&#8217;s favourite subjects, the teacher was
motivated and did not put up with any crap the
students gave him. Class participation was
marginal, and Daria was starting to gather a
major difference between HHS and LHS. In HHS
most students were bad because they didn&#8217;t know
better. In LHS most students were bad because
they didn&#8217;t care. Daria wasn&#8217;t sure what was
worse, but knew that Quinn would fit in perfectly
with the latter group.
<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent" >The black girl, Jodie was her name, talked again
to &#8212; or rather at &#8212; Daria about her work in
the student council. She did not ask her to
participate, but her move to arouse Daria&#8217;s
interest or curiosity was too plain to be effective.
Daria nodded and &#8216;hmm&#8217;d where appropriate,
but did not really listen. Jodie&#8217;s boyfriend,
Mack, tried to get some attention from her, but
was cut short when that stupid jock, Kevin,
Daria reminded herself, asked about something
concerning the football team. Seeing Mack go off
after being called &#8216;Mack Daddy&#8217; was one of the
highlights.
<!--l. 48--><p class="noindent" >Math was boring as ever. Daria was looking
forward to joining the AP class next year. She
never understood how people could have problems
with memorizing a few theorems and rules and
applying them. The left and the right side of the
&#8216;=&#8217; were the same just written differently. If one
looks at it in a certain way, math never produced
anything new.
<!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >PE turned out to be OK. At least there was no
commotion in the locker room and none of
the girls acted hostile. There wasn&#8217;t a DMZ
around her as if she was a leper, either, a fact
that really pleased Daria. There was no overt
ogling either, so the news of yesterday&#8217;s lunch
likely had spread. The coach made sure that
everyone was working, and it was interesting to
see how fast the Lane girl was sent off running
laps again. Daria would have made a bet she   and the coach had an agreement of some sort.
 Maybe she could arrange something for herself
 to get out of the cheerleader practice a.k.a.
 gymnastics. Kama sutra and Tantra training
 should be done in private and would be much
 more entertaining with an appropriate training
 partner.
 <!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" >
 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 67--><p class="noindent" >Before hitting the shower after PE Daria
 approached Ms. Morris again.
 <!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Ms. Morris, my sister and I will be at the girls&#8217;
 gym in the afternoon today.&#8221;
 <!--l. 73--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;m looking forward to see you girls. The girls&#8217;
 gym doesn&#8217;t draw a crowd, seeing some new faces
 is going to be nice.&#8221;
 <!--l. 76--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hmm, I wanted to ask you about the daily open
 gym. You said it&#8217;s an hour before school?&#8221;
 <!--l. 79--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;The gym opens at 7 and at 8 everybody has to
 hit the showers. This gives you 15 minutes
 until home room starts. Tight schedule, but
 manageable.&#8221;
 <!--l. 82--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Unless you need 40 minutes to plaster some gunk
 on your face. OK, so no problem for me.&#8221;
 <!--l. 85--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Aeh, Daria, why are you asking about the open
 gym if there&#8217;s girls&#8217; gym twice a week?&#8221;
 <!--l. 89--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I think the daily slot fits my day better. And an
 hour of gym is sufficient. If you&#8217;re not done for
 after an hour of gym, you&#8217;re either Hercules or
 picking your nose.&#8221;
 <!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" >Ms. Morris chuckled.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Well, yes, the girls can lose their focus a little.
 But that is not ... well ... it&#8217;s just that the daily
 slot is only used by guys.&#8221;
 <!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;This is not a designated boys&#8217; only slot, is
 it?&#8221;
 <!--l. 98--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No, it&#8217;s open for everybody, but, I mean, being
 the only girl, wouldn&#8217;t you be uncomfortable?&#8221;
 <!--l. 100--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I think not, but I&#8217;ll just try and see.&#8221;
 <!--l. 102--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">You do not get what I mean.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s for sure. But be prepared to be
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
surrounded by football players.&#8221;
<!--l. 106--><p class="noindent" >Daria shrugged.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;If I went to a public gym I&#8217;d be surrounded by
all kinds of strange guys.&#8221;
<!--l. 109--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;OK, go and try.&#8221;
<!--l. 111--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Thanks, bye.&#8221;
<!--l. 113--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Bye.&#8221;
<!--l. 115--><p class="noindent" >Ms. Manson watched Daria vanish into the locker
room. She was not sure if a girl training with the
football team was such a bright idea. Even if
it took you a second glance, Daria still was
a girl. It was doubtful that the team would
welcome an alien to their &#8216;team time&#8217;, even if
the gym was gernerally open to the public.
Ms. Morris would give Coach Gibson some
advance warning so he would be prepared for a
girl intruding. Well, seeing Daria train in the
afternoon would help with the evaluation of the
situation.
<!--l. 124--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>*****</h4>
<!--l. 131--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Fellow Fashion Club members, I&#8217;d like to
commemorate the excursion to Cashman&#8217;s today
after school. The new line of angora turtleneck
sweaters is coming in today and we have to
prepare for the end of winter. We&#8217;ll meet at my
car after school.&#8221;
<!--l. 133--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yeaaah, Sandi.&#8221;
<!--l. 135--><p class="noindent" >Stacy looked into her omnipresent notebook tp
confirm the details of the expedition.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Yes, we need to be the first to scan the new
collection so we do not fall behind the current
fashion as it happened to me when I was, omygod,
I&#8217;m wearing the shirt right now, omygod, I&#8217;m
so...&#8221;
<br class="newline" />Stacy started to hyperventilate as the guilt and
embarrassment came back.
<!--l. 143--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;STACY! Slow! Breathe! The shirt is fine with thepair of pants you are wearing now!&#8221;
 <!--l. 145--><p class="noindent" >Quinn approached the group after she had
 changed her books at her locker. Those girls were
 not her first choice, but she needed to start
 somewhere to make some friends.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Hi. Ready for music, Tiffany?&#8221;
 <!--l. 150--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yeaaah.&#8221;
 <!--l. 152--><p class="noindent" >Delighted to see the new girl, Stacy welcomed her
 as well.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Hey Quinn, we&#8217;re going to Cashman&#8217;s after
 school today to screen the new sweaters arriving
 this morning, would you like to join us?&#8221;
 <!--l. 156--><p class="noindent" >Sandi shot her secretary a disapproving glare; how
 could she take the initiative and invite that skank
 that was likely going to be a serious problem for
 the Fashion Club without consulting the president
 first? Stacy immediately went wide eyed as
 she realized what she had done. This was a
 serious violation of the hierarchy. She was in
 trouble.
 <!--l. 162--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yes Quinn, I was about to extend that invitation
 to you.&#8221; Sandi took control again.
 <!--l. 165--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Ah, thanks, but I won&#8217;t be able to make it
 today.&#8221;
 <!--l. 167--><p class="noindent" >Sandi was relieved. Maybe she could spin the
 situation to her advantage.
 <!--l. 170--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Gee, Quinn, that is so sad. Is your model
 job-thingy taking up so much of your time that
 you won&#8217;t be able to stay fashionable?&#8221;
 <!--l. 172--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not my job. I&#8217;ve training today.&#8221;
 <!--l. 177--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Like, physical training? That get&#8217;s you all
 sweaty? Quinn, I&#8217;m sorry to inform you that
 this is not an activity that is suitable for a
 member of the Fashion Club. And just think
 how those jock chicks look like with muscles
 everywhere.&#8221;
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Like those incredible...stop it, Griffin.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 180--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;It&#8217;s not that I want to, Sandi. Mom&#8217;s forcing
 me.&#8221;
 <!--l. 182--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;So, you let your mother dictate your schedule?&#8221;
 <!--l. 185--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;It&#8217;s more the doctor. &#8216;You need to exercise your
 muscles to keep up with your skeleton&#8217;. Mom just
 turned &#8216;need&#8217; to &#8216;must&#8217;.&#8221;

making me go anyway.&#8221;

 <!--l. 244--><p class="noindent" >The students arranged themselves caste-wise at
 the lunch room&#8217;s tables. The difference between
 HHS and LHS was that the tables did not
 have strictly fixed assignments, but were
 dynamically occupied. Some tables were left for
 the untouchables, outsiders like Daria herself. She
 was halfway through her meal without any
 interruption or interaction when she noticed
 Scarlett approaching her after returning her tray.
 Daria looked up as she stood across from her,
 slightly nervous.

<!--l. 285--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I ran out on you like you were the Dark One
himself.&#8221; Scarlett blurted her problem out, still
confused by Daria&#8217;s previous comment. The
then ensuing blush indicated that she finally
not only understood, but took that a little
personally.
<!--l. 291--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;And likely barfed like I smelled like his feet,

Scarlett surely would be hurt in the long run.

She was perfect enough to scare guys away. Well,
at least this way the number of Quinn&#8217;s dates

awkward. A girl has to step on her toes to kiss
you - not the other way round.&#8221;

 However, two hours of Mr. O&#8217;Neill in a row was
 something that should be limited to Gitmo.
 Without the upcoming visit to the gym to
 look forward to, Daria would have to come up
 with some serious ideas how to prevent her
 brain from leaving her skull, but conceiving a
 low-key high-impact scheme to prepare Quinn for
 her massage was really enjoyable. Daria was
 coming up with numerous tiny things that could
 be adapted and combined depending on the
 situation. It was important to make sure that her
 actions would not backfire at her through their
 mother. But Daria would start off with the
 simplest plan: Assuming Quinn had skipped her
 training during the summer, which was very
 likely, sticking to her normal training plan would
 be a very suitable starting point for Quinn&#8217;s
 journey to misery.

 the funding reports for the current school year
 sitting on a bench, glancing every now and

 minutes a slow round through the room, speaking
 hushed words of encouragement and minor
 corrections to the girls. The room&#8217;s silence was
 only interrupted by weights&#8217; &#8216;clink&#8217;ing and a little
 huffing and groaning once one of the girls pushed
 her limits.
 <!--l. 424--><p class="noindent" >The girls only gym was a good thing. The girls
 did not come here to be seen, but to train. This

 were.

little earlier today.
<!--l. 433--><p class="noindent" >She knew she had forgotten something when the
Morgendorffer girls entered from the locker room.
Quinn, the freshman, wore her LHS issued
PE t-shirt and long trousers. Daria wore the
uniform&#8217;s training shorts, but wore nothing more
than a sturdy sports bra as a top. And looking at
her build, Ms. Morris figured that this was not to
troll for boys, but to make training bearable.
Daria spotted her and simply nodded as she
steered her sister over to the cardiac exercise
machines to warm up.

<!--l. 448--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Damn. Look at them. The red head&#8217;s just tall,

in the silence of gym the words were audible
everywhere.

explanation before she got a replay of Tuesday&#8217;s
episode in PE and headed over to the girls.
She would give Daria and Quinn some leeway
initially and just watch; she had the hunch that
they knew their way around in a gym and
would not need supervision, as the rest of the
regulars.

a task that Quinn was able to complete without

lightly to do some leg training while Quinn wentto the sit-up-machine. Daria moved rapidly and
 concentrated through her sets. As she put the

 warm up and then split up for different exercises.
 Quinn headed over likely to do some abs training.
 She fumbled a while to set up the machine. With
 her height, she had to make every adjustment
 possible to fit properly. She then started her sets,
 but was not really enthusiastic.
 <!--l. 479--><p class="noindent" >Daria went over to the free weights section and
 seriously loaded a barbell and started doing knee
 bends in quick succession. Afterwards she shifted
 to lifting for her shoulders. Then did some
 reverse biceps curls above head level. Given
 the quick succession of the sets, that was an
 impressive display of strength and endurance,
 well above the level of the other girls in the
 gym.

Morris was. She really hated to be in the spotlight
all the time, and had hoped that the people in the
gym would just ignore her.
<!--l. 511--><p class="noindent" >Ms. Morris had to agree with the girls, Daria&#8217;s
body was a piece of art - but it did not really fit a
girl. She was not as excessively muscular as
some female body builders, but definitely too
muscular for a girl. She did not really fit in
here, having to re-adjust every weight she put
her hands on. She was far more focused than
the other girls and trained different muscle
groups.
<!--l. 518--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I bet the other has signed her name in blood to
get that figure. She&#8217;s just &#8216;whoa&#8217;.&#8221;
<!--l. 520--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Those legs won&#8217;t end - and not an ounce of fat
out of place.&#8221;
<!--l. 522--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;They&#8217;re so alike and so different...&#8221;
<!--l. 524--><p class="noindent" >Ms. Morris looked back at the girls and shot them
a nasty glare.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;They&#8217;re sisters, Ladies. Get movin&#8217;!&#8221;
<!--l. 527--><p class="noindent" >Her tone made it clear to them that they were
about to cross a line. They picked their exercises
up again and just shot some clandestine glances
at the newcomers every now and then.
<!--l. 531--><p class="noindent" >Ms. Morris noticed the by-the-book handling of
the equipment that Daria had to avoid accidents
and to train for maximum effect with the lowest
risk of an injury. That girl knew her way around a
gym. She saw a Daria glistening with sweat watch
her sister a while and put down the barbell.
In the silence of the gym she did not even
have to eavesdrop to understand the following
conversation.
<!--l. 538--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a

 Quinn who took a drink from her bottle. Daria&#8217;s
 sports bra was soaked and showed more than
 Quinn deemed decent. Her muscles glistened
 with sweat, and despite her efforts to clean
 herself up on a towel, she was dripping on the
 floor.
 <!--l. 545--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Quinn, you just completed the workout at the
 sit-up-machine?&#8221;
 <!--l. 547--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yes, 30 pounds, 15 repetitions, three sets.&#8221;
 <!--l. 550--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yes, of course. And because you are so well
 trained, you didn&#8217;t even sweat.&#8221;
 <!--l. 552--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Sure I did! Look, I&#8217;m getting all icky!&#8221; Quinn
 said in disdain and rose her arms to show her
 armpits to her sister.
 <!--l. 555--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yeah, I can see you&#8217;re sweaty all over and gave
 everything you have.&#8221;
 <br class="newline" />Daria pointed at the weights that were clearly set
 to 15 pounds.
 <!--l. 558--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Oops, I didn&#8217;t notice.&#8221; Quinn said with her
 patented &#8216;innocent girl&#8217; smile. That hadn&#8217;t worked
 on Daria for at least ten years.
 <!--l. 562--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Of course not. And because you could not
 notice the difference between 15 and 30 pounds
 you surely need more training. Let me help
 you.&#8221;
 <!--l. 564--><p class="noindent" >Daria set the weights to 35 pounds. Quinn
 tried to get away, but Daria&#8217;s firm hand on her
 shoulder made it clear that she would not weasel
 out of it.
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span

 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a

 <!--l. 570--><p class="noindent" >Ms. Morris could not help it, she had to smile. On
 the difference between the sisters when it came to
 things physical, and how Daria moved in on
 Quinn. It was nice to see that Quinn had a
 competent personal trainer that made sure that
 her weaker self would not prevail.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a

<!--l. 578--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;And now repeat the complete excercise. Properly.
Up, hold, down. Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;
<!--l. 580--><p class="noindent" >Quinn looked pleading into Daria&#8217;s eyes, and
could immediately tell that any complaining
would be futile. She knew that Helen had given
Daria the authority to make sure Quinn did her
exercises. Daria would not do a thing if she was to
defy her. Beside telling their mother, and that
was a really bad idea. Daria did not even move to
continue her own exercises. She wouldn&#8217;t even be
able to &#8216;miscount&#8217; a little.
<!--l. 589--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Quinn, you are going to sweat today, no matter
whether you like it or not. You need to and I will
make you - if I have to. Get going, Quinn. Up.
Hold. Down.&#8221;
<!--l. 591--><p class="noindent" >Daria watched Quinn through her exercise. Her
sister had such a perfect body that made her
envious every time she was exposed to it. Daria
had considered stopping her training once she
became aware that getting muscular all over was
not necessarily advantageous for a girl. The
doctors told her that her bones had already grown
to adjust to her activities and there was no way
that she would ever be lanky again. So the
options were just &#8216;big and muscular&#8217; or &#8216;big and
flabby&#8217;. Daria had been vain enough to chose the
first option.
<!--l. 599--><p class="noindent" >Daria made sure that Quinn did this one by the
book, with 45 seconds between the sets and not a
second more. During the last five repetitions of set
three, Daria gave Quinn a hand as she had
obviously reached her limit.
<!--l. 603--><p class="noindent" >Quinn sat completely exhausted on the machine
and used her own towel to mop up the sweat that
oozed from her every pore. Daria handed her the
water bottle and left.
<br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Thank god she&#8217;s going to do her own training. I</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">was afraid she would be on my back and put me</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">through the wringer today.</span>&#187;
                                            <!--l. 609--><p class="noindent" >
 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-15000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 611--><p class="noindent" >Ms. Morris was delighted to see the professional
 monitoring Daria did and how she supported her
 sister once she noted her approaching her limit.
 This way she could push her sister to her limits
 without endangering her health. If you had to hire
 a trainer like that, you&#8217;d have to pay serious
 money. She was not happy when she saw Daria
 remove a dumbbell from the free weights section,
 but decided to trust her enough to let it slide. She
 was more interested in what would happen
 next.
 <!--l. 619--><p class="noindent" >
 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-16000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 621--><p class="noindent" >Quinn&#8217;s hope was crushed when Daria came back
 with a heavy looking dumbbell. Daria was not
 planning to leave her side until they were home
 again.
 <!--l. 625--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Now, you did the training for the abs. We&#8217;re now
 doing something new, the same stuff for the back.
 Let me adjust the machine.&#8221;
 <!--l. 627--><p class="noindent" >Quinn got up and Daria used practiced motions
 to change the machine. Quinn was relieved as she
 saw her sister set the weights to 10 pounds.
 <!--l. 632--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Ok, now put your hips against that padding, and
 rest your heels against this. Now put the pulley
 behind your shoulders. Yes, you need to go
 prone. Now erect yourself. That&#8217;s it. 10 - 15 - 3.
 Go.&#8221;
 <!--l. 634--><p class="noindent" >Quinn was shocked how much she had to struggle
 with the meager 10 pounds now. Daria stayed
 next to her and picked up the dumbbell to do
 some biceps curls on the side while she monitored
 Quinn. Quinn struggled through the first set, was
 on her last legs through the second set and
 required Daria&#8217;s continuous assistance through
 the third. She was wiped and came to the
 dreadful conclusion that Daria was going to push
 her to her limits today.
 <!--l. 643--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Now the legs. Get up, we don&#8217;t have all day.
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
Move Quinn, get over there, I know you like
your legs in good shape. And it helps your
job. Do your exercises on your own, but I&#8217;m
watching.&#8221;
<!--l. 645--><p class="noindent" >Daria pushed her towards the leg trainer, and
Quinn willy-nilly set it up (properly this time)
and started. Daria took a sip from her own bottle
and worked further on her arms. Someway into
the second set of Quinn&#8217;s second exercise Daria
had to intervene again.
<!--l. 650--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-17000"></a>*****</h4>
<!--l. 652--><p class="noindent" >The girls watched with awe at how Daria
commandeered her sister through her exercises.
<!--l. 655--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Uh, whoa, that&#8217;s brutal.&#8221;
<!--l. 657--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;She&#8217;s pushing her. Hard.&#8221;
<!--l. 659--><p class="noindent" >There was an aura of authority around Daria that
was compelling. She raised her voice every now
and then to nudge her sister on.
<!--l. 662--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I don&#8217;t know If I&#8217;d be able to say &#8216;No&#8217;...&#8221;
<!--l. 664--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Me neither.&#8221;
<!--l. 666--><p class="noindent" >Daria heard that as well, only Quinn was too
caught up in her exercises to care for her
surroundings.
<br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">She may be my sister, but she has made it</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">personal. She deserves just the best.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 671--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-18000"></a>*****</h4>
<!--l. 675--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Quinn, physiotherapy is to increase your health,
not to ruin it. And if you keep repeating that
excercise that way, you will ruin your knee and
your ankles. Form a straight line. Right. That
way. Now keep it that way.&#8221;
<!--l. 677--><p class="noindent" >Daria returned the dumbbell, walked over to the
next machine and set it up for her own exercises.
She had to adjust about every adjustable setting
on the machine to fit her frame - especially the
weights. She looked back at Quinn, who was doing
her exercises rather half-assed. Daria spoke     up.
 <!--l. 685--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;At home it&#8217;s hard to get you to look anywhere
 else but the mirror, but you ignore those in here.
 They have been placed in here for a reason. And
 that&#8217;s not for you to check if your make-up is
 smudged. Watch yourself and monitor your
 movements!&#8221;
 <!--l. 687--><p class="noindent" >Quinn looked over to her sister with an annoyed
 expression, but she did as she was told. If Daria
 said so, she could really ruin her health if she
 didn&#8217;t.
 <!--l. 690--><p class="noindent" >
 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-19000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 692--><p class="noindent" >The professional way Daria coached her sister
 struck Ms. Morris. She would not even overlook the
 slightest misalignment or malposition. Depending
 on the severeness of the error Daria would just
 correct Quinn, or scold her. Daria let her have
 breaks, but only short ones so her heart rate
 would not drop too far. Daria would assist, but
 only if Quinn really reached her limits. Ms. Morris
 was sure Daria started to work against Quinn the
 one and only time that Quinn tried to coax her
 sister into doing the work. Daria was not just a
 proficient sportswoman, but a competent coach as
 well. She gave the less than enthusiastic Quinn a
 really nice workover.
 <!--l. 702--><p class="noindent" >
 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-20000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 704--><p class="noindent" >The girls continued to watch Daria and Quinn, as
 they had gotten from the little talk between the
 two tall girls. They met discreetly between
 their own exercises to compare their notes
 and managed not to upset Ms. Morris any
 further.
 <!--l. 709--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;She&#8217;s like a drill instructor. On a good day.&#8221;
 <!--l. 711--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;That&#8217;s her sister there. Picture her coaching
 someone else.&#8221;
 <!--l. 713--><p class="noindent" >The girls just looked at each other as they
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
imagined themselves in that position. An image
they did not like.
<!--l. 716--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Does she need a dictionary to look up &#8216;mercy&#8217;?&#8221;
<!--l. 718--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">I doubt it would be nearly so much fun with</span>
<span

that.
<!--l. 721--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-21000"></a>*****</h4>
<!--l. 723--><p class="noindent" >The training seemed to last an eternity. Daria
worked her hard as she had never done before.
Quinn had learned that cutting corners meant a
complete repeat, so she complied. She noted the
wondering glances the few other girls shot at the
siblings, but Quinn hoped that the girls&#8217; focus
was on Daria in drill sergeant mode and not on
her unfashionable and icky appearance and
mediocre performance. Her water ran out prior to
the penultimate exercise, but Daria just made
her continue. In the end, Daria had to nearly
continuously assist her.
<!--l. 732--><p class="noindent" >Once she was finished Daria handed her her
half filled water bottle. Sharing like this was
unsanitary, but Quinn did not have enough
energy to care and started to drain it in one
go.
<!--l. 736--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Whoa, slow down, tiger.&#8221;
<br class="newline" />Daria had a hard time not grinning. Someone
had not kept up with her exercises during the
summer. Beside that back exercises she didn&#8217;t add
or intensify a single exercise, but Quinn was
completely pooped. Luckily there was no PE
tomorrow, as she was sure that Quinn was going
be sore all over.
<!--l. 742--><p class="noindent" >Daria gave the bottle back after some seconds and
let her sister drain it in the second go. After some
minutes, Daria carried/dragged Quinn into the
locker room. Daria undressed while Quinn was
slumped in front of her locker and tried to get he
bearings.
<!--l. 748--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Quinn, we need to get going. Mom or dad will be
waiting to pick us up and Coach Morris will wantto lock up on time.&#8221;
 <!--l. 750--><p class="noindent" >How done Quinn was for Daria realized as she
 complained neither as Daria started to help her to
 undress nor as she led her stark naked over to the
 showers while some other girls were around.
 Quinn would have never ever gone along with it, if
 she had been really aware of it. She was obvious
 beyond caring. At least Quinn cleaned herself up
 on her own once she was put under a nice
 lukewarm shower.
 <!--l. 758--><p class="noindent" >Daria showered herself and divided her attention
 between Quinn under the nozzle next to her and
 the three other girls in the shower. She had not
 seen any of them and they seemed to have seen
 neither Quinn nor Daria before. Especially not
 stark naked in the shower. But the reactions did
 not differ much from those Daria had gotten
 during her regular PE class. The rumor mill in
 the upper classes would be fed new facts, and
 they were the first to be able to make a direct
 comparison between the model and the freak.
 Daria knew that without her glasses there was no
 way to deny the familarity between herself and
 Quinn, but besides that their size was the only
 thing they had in common.
 <!--l. 770--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Quinn, we need to get dressed. Sorry, but you
 can&#8217;t stay under that comfy shower forever.&#8221;
 <!--l. 772--><p class="noindent" >Quinn looked up, shook the cobwebs from her
 brain, turned the water off and nodded at her
 sister. Daria smirked at the slight blush that
 spread over the creamy skin of the red head as she
 realized that she had only a small shower towel at
 hand that would at most cover two of the critical
 regions. Quinn covered her front with the towel on
 the way to her locker, and mooned everybody who
 cared to look.
 <!--l. 781--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">God, Quinn, we&#8217;re all girls in here. There is</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">nothing the others haven&#8217;t seen before. You want</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">all eyes on you all day long, and now you turn</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">shy.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 792--><p class="noindent" >Daria dried herself with a second towel and
 dressed herself while keeping an eye on Quinn,
 nudging her on every now and then. They left the
 school and found her mother&#8217;s UAV in the
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
parking lot. Walking over, Daria noted that
Quinn&#8217;s movements were a little erratic.
<!--l. 797--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Slight hypoglycemia. Damnit, are you starving</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">yourself again?</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />Daria was not happy. She should have noticed this
before it happened. They got into the car,
and their mother immediately joined into the
traffic.
<!--l. 801--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You&#8217;re a little late, girls.&#8221;
<!--l. 804--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Sorry mom, but training really wiped Quinn
out and the shower took a little longer than
expected.&#8221;
<!--l. 806--><p class="noindent" >Quinn just nodded at her mother from the front
seat.
<!--l. 809--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Well, looking at Quinn that seems to be the
truth. Did Daria assign an uncalled for hard
training, Quinn?&#8221;
<!--l. 811--><p class="noindent" >Quinn shook her head, because Daria hadn&#8217;t.
There was a single new exercise, and that was not
the reason for her predicament. She knew she had
slacked around during the summer.
<!--l. 816--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;She&#8217;s likely still dealing with the move and the
climate change, so I don&#8217;t see a problem.&#8221;

<!--l. 824--><p class="noindent" >Doing chores was unusual for Jane, but busying
herself with a task that she loathed helped her to
get her mind a little off things. While running or
painting she mulled things over and over again
but came to no conclusion. This was really
frustrating.
<!--l. 829--><p class="noindent" >She had still not been able to apologize to Daria,
but being around her was getting easier. And she
wasn&#8217;t exactly sure what she felt about her.
Mulling things over for the n-th time was a
waste, and getting unpleasant chores done
wasn&#8217;t bad either. At least the butterflies were
gone. Maybe they were bugging her mother.    Hopefully to an extent that she would smack
 them.

 short journey home in silence. Daria picked up
 Quinn&#8217;s gym back as well as her own after they
 arrived and immediately headed through the
 garage to the washing machine, starting her and
 her sister&#8217;s gym cloths and towels. No use in
 waiting until the stuff started developing its own
 aroma.

 <!--l. 848--><p class="noindent" >In the kitchen Quinn had made a pitcher with
 juice spritzer and just refilled her glass.
 <!--l. 851--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Good thought, Quinn. May I?&#8221;
 <!--l. 853--><p class="noindent" >Quinn nodded while downing her second helping,
 Daria filled a glass on her own, and watched her
 dad set the dinner table while she downed it. He
 seemed to have made some kind of bruscetta au
 gratin. A nice meal, unless he had been to liberal
 with the Tabasco again.
 <!--l. 858--><p class="noindent" >Daria and Quinn refilled their glasses, put the
 now empty pitcher into the sink and moved to the
 dinner table. The dinner itself was a quiet affair,
 as Quinn was too tired to talk, Daria generally
 taciturn, which left Jake and Helen to talk about
 their day. Luckily, Jake had overlooked the
 Tabasco all together, and the meal had merely a
 slight hint of pepper.
 <!--l. 864--><p class="noindent" >With a smirk Daria watched Quinn work herself
 through her third helping of bruscetta from the

<!--l. 870--><p class="noindent" >Trent woke up well after dusk. He went into the
kitchen to drink something. The band hadn&#8217;t been
over since the trip to Food Lord, there should be
soda left. He found Jane&#8217;s room deserted and
was afraid to find her sulking in the kitchen
again, but luckily the kitchen was empty. He
got himself an Ultra Cola from the fridge and
took a sip. He heard steps coming up from
the basement and Jane came in carrying a
basket.
<!--l. 877--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Ah Trent, won against Morpheus?&#8221;
<!--l. 879--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Nah, just a ceasefire.&#8221;
<!--l. 881--><p class="noindent" >He took another sip from his drink. Jane was
coming out of her funk. Good.
<!--l. 883--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You&#8217;re doing laundry, Janey? Could you...&#8221;
<!--l. 886--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No. No way, Trent. I want my stuff clean after a
single cycle. Wash your own stuff.&#8221;
<!--l. 888--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;But Janey...&#8221;
<!--l. 890--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No. Do your own laundry or bum another shirt
from Jesse.&#8221;
<!--l. 892--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Jane, I...&#8221;
<!--l. 895--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No. Ask mom, or Monique if you feel suicidal.
Grow up, I am not your maid.&#8221;
<!--l. 897--><p class="noindent" >Jane grabbed a soda from the fridge as well. If she
did that chore for Trent only once she would be
stuck with it forever.
<!--l. 901--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;And do not think of starting a cycle right now.
My bed linen goes next. You have the whole week
after that.&#8221;
<!--l. 903--><p class="noindent" >Jane went to her room immediately after Trent
had acknowledged her instructions. Doing his
laundry wasn&#8217;t a bad idea. The pile in his closet
was a little smelly. And maybe watching the
clothes spin in the drum would inspire him for
some really cool lyrics.

<!--l. 910--><p class="noindent" >Before going to bed, Daria knocked at her sister&#8217;s
door and entered after being invited to. Quinn
was sprawled out on the bed in her bedclothes at
the verge of falling asleep.                    <!--l. 914--><p class="noindent" >Daria tossed her the bottle of Ibuprofen she had
 retrieved beforehand.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Take one right now and a second in the morning.
 The soreness is going to be extremely nasty
 otherwise. Take another one to school for lunch.&#8221;
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">With this its just going to be normal nasty, but</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">I&#8217;m not going to ruin your hope...</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 920--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yeah, thanks Daria. Today was hard.&#8221;
 <br class="newline" />Quinn popped a pill with some water from her
 bedstand.
 <!--l. 923--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;And you did not back out. Good work. Now
 sleep. Good night.&#8221;
 <!--l. 925--><p class="noindent" >Daria watched Quinn as she lay down again and
 closed the door. Quinn was likely to be asleep
 before she reached her room. Daria went to sleep
 as well hoping for a better sleep than the nights
 before. She hadn&#8217;t trained as hard as usual, but it
 was the first time for nearly two weeks. Tomorrow
 was Friday, and she was looking forward to
 her first training with the local chapter. Her
 bruise was well enough that she did not need
 Quinn&#8217;s services tonight, and she had prepared
 Quinn properly for the payback. She gave her 10
 minutes, tops.

 <!--l. 936--><p class="noindent" >With a fresh set of sheets Jane would get a really
 good night of sleep. She turned in early, as she
 planned to join Mystic Spiral on their Saturday
 night gig at the Zon. There would be people,
 there would be loud music and she was planning
 to lose herself a little. She&#8217;d better prepare.
