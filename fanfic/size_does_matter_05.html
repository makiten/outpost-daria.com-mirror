 id="x1-2000"></a>Part 5</h3>
 <!--l. 14--><p class="noindent" >Before the first class of the day, Ms. Morris went
 to the attendance/ infirmary/ storage room
 Coach Gibson used as his office most of the
 time. And stereotypical for a morning, a box
 from Do-me-a-Donut was found on the desk
 as he nursed on a coffee while reading &#8216;USA
 Today&#8217;.
 <!--l. 19--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Morning, Gibson.&#8221;
 <!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Morning. What&#8217;s the matter, Morris?&#8221;
 <!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >He and the female coach got along, but preferred
 to stay clear of one another. Her visiting his office
 was unusual.
 <!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;d like to give you a heads-up. Unofficial, and
 just between the two of us.&#8221;
 <!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >He put down his coffee and folded the &#8216;newpaper&#8217;.
 That seemed serious.
 <!--l. 31--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;What happened?&#8221;
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
<!--l. 34--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Nothing - for now. You remember those new girls
Ms. Li told everyone about? The tall ones?&#8221;
<!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yeah, but girls aren&#8217;t my problem.&#8221;
<!--l. 38--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Maybe they will be. At least one of them.
Daria.&#8221;
<!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;And how&#8217;s that supposed to happen, Morris?&#8221;
<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;She was in my &#8216;girls only&#8217; gym time yesterday
and wasn&#8217;t really happy with it. She&#8217;s thinking
about attending the open gym time in the
morning...&#8221;
<!--l. 46--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Ah, come on, that&#8217;s stupid. A girl among all the
guys...&#8221;
<!--l. 49--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;She said it wouldn&#8217;t matter to her. And take my
word for it: Strength wise she&#8217;s likely on par with
the guys.&#8221;
<!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >Coach Gibson was not pleased. A girl during the
open time could cause trouble. Worse, a girl
during the open time could require supervision
and keep him from his breakfast.
<!--l. 55--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You&#8217;re talking nonsense, Morris.&#8221;
<!--l. 58--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen her in the gym. But I guess that&#8217;s
something you have to see with your own eyes.&#8221;
<!--l. 60--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I enjoy a good surprise!&#8221;
<!--l. 62--><p class="noindent" >Ms. Morris left coach Gibson in his personal
retreat and headed over to the teacher&#8217;s lounge.
<br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">This may be an unpleasant surprise for you...</span>&#187;
<!--l. 66--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>*****</h4>
<!--l. 68--><p class="noindent" >The school day on Friday was pleasantly dull.
Everyone&#8217;s mind was already preparing for the
weekend. Luckily there were no sport events right
at the beginning of the school year, so no one
bugged Daria to attend them.
<!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >Between two classes she found her locker blocked
by Kevin and Brittany playing tonsil hockey.
Daria cleared her throat noisily, twice, but to no
avail.
<!--l. 75--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Excuse me.&#8221;
<!--l. 77--><p class="noindent" >The couple showed no reaction but sloppy
sounds.
<!--l. 79--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Brrr.</span>&#187;                                     <br class="newline" />Daria nudged Kevin - carefully, so that they
 would not bite each other&#8217;s tongues. Being
 disturbed during his fifth favourite occupation
 (after playing football, something else, watching
 football and drinking beer) did not please Kevin,
 and he turned quickly around.
 <!--l. 85--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;What&#8217;s your problem, man?!&#8221;
 <!--l. 87--><p class="noindent" >Kevin&#8217;s expression became less hostile once he
 recognized the intruder as Daria. However,
 Brittany was less amused once she noticed that
 another girl was talking to her man.
 <!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You&#8217;re blocking my locker. Just step aside and
 continue ignoring me.&#8221;
 <!--l. 93--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hu?&#8221;
 <!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" >Brittany was a little quicker and nudged Kevin a
 yard down the lockers. Brittany was not sure
 what to make of Daria and hence was wary
 around her. That girl had two options to hit on
 her boyfriend.
 <!--l. 99--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Come. And now Kevvie...&#8221;
 <!--l. 101--><p class="noindent" >The immediately resumed lip-locking, and Daria
 shook her head while switching books.
 <!--l. 105--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">At least they don&#8217;t shag in the open. Well. I&#8217;ve</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">been here just four days. Maybe they do. *Brrr*.</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">*Brrrrrr*.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 107--><p class="noindent" >
 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 109--><p class="noindent" >After Thursday had provided Quinn with no
 occasion to meet this strange Jane Lane, she was
 set to talk to her today. The news about Daria&#8217;s
 lunch encounter on Wednesday - there was
 supposedly a sequel yesterday - had spread
 through school. Unfortunately, the rumours were
 off the facts. &#8216;She rejected a girl because she&#8217;s
 straight&#8217; is not as interesting as &#8216;squishy lesbian
 lovers quarrel&#8217;.
 <!--l. 116--><p class="noindent" >Quinn made several attempts to catch her
 between classes. Lunch was not an option, as
 freshmen and sophomores were in different lunch
 periods. Quinn got her chance between Math and
 Home Ec. when she spotted a girl fitting the
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
description given by Stacy in the hallway. A
rather unobstructed field of view even in a crowd
was one of the perks of her size. With limited
time at hand, she sped up to catch up with the
girl.
<!--l. 123--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hey, you&#8217;re Jane Lane?&#8221;
<!--l. 125--><p class="noindent" >Jane turned as she heard the voice behind
her. She was not used to being talked to by
other students, and she could not fit the voice
to somebody she knew. The view was not as
she expected. There wasn&#8217;t a face where she
anticipated one - but a chest. She had to look up
and realized that the tall freshman girl that
had transferred in on Monday was addressing
her.
<!--l. 131--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yessss?&#8221;
<!--l. 133--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Jane Lane? You&#8217;re in self-esteem class?&#8221;
<!--l. 135--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Damn, bad news travels fast...</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;That&#8217;s me. Seventh time. I&#8217;m esteem-resistant.&#8221;
<!--l. 138--><p class="noindent" >Jane watched with fascination how the girl&#8217;s
expression changed once she had acknowledged
her to be Jane Lane. It went from friendly and
open to far more serious than the girl&#8217;s outward
appearance had indicated possible. She looked her
over thoroughly with a neutral expression, and
Jane repaid the favour.
<!--l. 143--><p class="noindent" >The girl was thin, but not as lanky as Jane herself
and, Jane had to admit grudgingly, had a real
figure. Her rather fashionable clothes brought it
out well without being obtrusive. Her face was
cute without much makeup, but her red hair
was really spectacular in its bounciness and
coloration. Her aura screamed &#8216;adore me&#8217; and she
would likely be able to reduce any male to a
slobbering idiot with a simple smile. Straight
males, that was. Most likely her picture was in the
Wikipedia under &#8216;offensive cuteness&#8217;.
<!--l. 152--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Another potential model. But I doubt she&#8217;d be</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">able to stand still long enough for more than a</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">picture. </span>&#187;
<!--l. 154--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Nice to meet you, Jane Lane. Just don&#8217;t bother
my sister. Bye.&#8221;
<!--l. 156--><p class="noindent" >That said, the girl&#8217;s expression became friendly
again, she turned on the spot and headed off withrapid strides. Jane was puzzled.
 <!--l. 160--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">What was that about? Who&#8217;s she? What business</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">do I have with her sister? Or not. </span><span 
class="ecbi-1095">Who is </span><span 
class="ecti-1095">her</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">sister? Weird.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 162--><p class="noindent" >This strange encounter was going to give her
 something to think about for at least the rest of
 the day.
 <!--l. 165--><p class="noindent" >
 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 167--><p class="noindent" >Home Ec. was the perfect class for Quinn to
 review her brief meeting with that girl. She
 dressed as alternative as Stacy had described, and
 her overall appearance seemed to scream &#8216;artist&#8217; -
 as Stacy had hinted at. No makeup, just that
 incredible red lipstick, which worked for her
 and did not even clash with the hue of her
 equally red jacket. That told Quinn that this girl
 had a very keen sense for color - or incredible
 luck.
 <!--l. 174--><p class="noindent" >The amount of earrings she displayed was too
 much in Quinn&#8217;s eyes, but Quinn was relieved
 that she had not noticed any bad vibes coming
 from the girl. She may be an outsider, but seemed
 not to keep bad company.
 <!--l. 178--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">From her looks I&#8217;d bet &#8216;flexible&#8217; wasn&#8217;t false</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">advertising.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 180--><p class="noindent" >Quinn smirked, stopped chopping veggies, and
 stretched her back.
 <!--l. 185--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Damn, don&#8217;t they have any kitchen counters in</span>
 <span

 <!--l. 189--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hey Daria.&#8221;
 <!--l. 191--><p class="noindent" >Daria spotted the male black student walking up
 to her. She waited for him to catch up with her,
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
after a week his name came easy to her.
<!--l. 194--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hi Mack.&#8221;
<!--l. 196--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;And? What&#8217;s your impression of LHS after your
first week?&#8221;
<!--l. 198--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I will survive. Somehow.&#8221;
<!--l. 200--><p class="noindent" >Mack laughed. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I tell myself every
morning. But how&#8217;re you doing?&#8221;
<!--l. 203--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">What do you want from me?</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />Daria glanced sideways at her fellow student and
shrugged.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Beside that &#8216;self-esteem&#8217; class there hasn&#8217;t been
more trouble that I expected.&#8221;
<!--l. 209--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Ah, yes, Jodie told me about that. I&#8217;ve no clue
what you&#8217;re doing there.&#8221;
<!--l. 211--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;O&#8217;Neill has no clue what he&#8217;s doing there,
either.&#8221;
<!--l. 213--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yeah, his touchy-feelyness is really bad.&#8221;
<!--l. 216--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;If I hadn&#8217;t seen him, I wouldn&#8217;t believe humans
could survive a spine ablation.&#8221;
<!--l. 218--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;For sure. That&#8217;s my stop. Later.&#8221;
<!--l. 220--><p class="noindent" >That said, Mack entered the classroom they were
just passing by. Daria continued her way alone
and mused what that conversation was about.
Nothing, really, just friendly chatter.
<!--l. 224--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Friendly chatter?!</span>&#187;

<!--l. 229--><p class="noindent" >The close encounter of the 2.5th kind had Jane&#8217;s
mind busy during her lunch period. The tall girl,
that hadn&#8217;t even bother to introduce herself, had
given her a cryptic message. Jane knew that she
had been evaluated, and obviously passed the
test. She wasn&#8217;t even sure what exactly had
been tested. She and the other girl were clearly
from different social worlds. And the whole
point of their conversation seemed to be about
&#8216;my sister&#8217;. Who ever that was. Jane had no
idea. She must be someone from LHS, as Jane
hadn&#8217;t had any contact with people outside
her class mates, her family and the band all    week.
 <!--l. 238--><p class="noindent" >A little further into her lunch the pieces fell
 together. The tall girl had transferred in on
 Monday, so likely had &#8216;my sister&#8217;. And from the
 group Jane had seen on Monday, there was only
 one person that could be that sister. The other
 tall girl. From self-esteem class. Who she had
 made a pass on.
 <!--l. 243--><p class="noindent" >Given this information, things made more sense.
 Thinking about it, their faces told about their
 familiarity. Their size was another thing they had
 in common. However, why were their figures so
 different?
 <!--l. 247--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">I bet there&#8217;s an interesting story to this.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 249--><p class="noindent" >The younger sister was taller among the two. Was
 there a still younger sibling at 7 foot? What
 were their parents like? Why did they behave
 and dress so differently? Their personalities
 seemed to be much more different from one
 another than Jane was used to among her
 siblings. Maybe that was all connected to a single
 cause.
 <!--l. 255--><p class="noindent" >
 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-8000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 257--><p class="noindent" >The last class of Daria&#8217;s week was the self-esteem
 class, which basically was identical to every
 lecture before except that Mr. O&#8217;Neill finished
 with a summary and an outlook for the next
 week. They would separate the boys and girls for
 two days for some &#8216;gender specific discussion&#8217;.
 Daria had a rather good idea what that would be
 about, and that could turn out to be fun. Not all
 girls in this class looked like stuck-up prudes, as
 that Lane girl had proved. The fact that Mrs.
 Manson would be leading that session invalidated
 all of Daria&#8217;s plans. That woman had it in for her,
 and upsetting her would be ... unwise, given her
 influence.
 <!--l. 267--><p class="noindent" >Another interesting observation about that Lane
 kid was the way she had acted all week. After
 their first, and memorable, encounter, she had
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
really shied away and had gone lengths to stay
out of Daria&#8217;s way. That was, luckily, caused by
embarrassment, and that seemed to fade away as
Daria found her looking at her one time or
another. She likely drew some pictures of Daria
during self-esteem class, as Daria caught her
looking over several times. But as the Lane girl
painted everyone in said class, that was most
likely not out of adoration, but out of availability.
That was fine for Daria. She could have sworn
that Jane, that was her name, had tried to talk to
her several times, but Daria could not tell for
sure.

<!--l. 280--><p class="noindent" >Ms. Morris entered Ms. Li&#8217;s office with a queasy
feeling. Being called in here was usually a bad
omen.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;You wanted to see me?&#8221;
<!--l. 285--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Ah, Ms. Morris. Yes, I have some questions
about the two Morgendorffer sisters that joined
LHS this Monday. You have both of them in
P.E.?&#8221;
<!--l. 287--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yes, but in different classes. Quinn&#8217;s a freshman,
and...&#8221;
<!--l. 289--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;...Daria a sophomore, I remember. How are they
doing, especially Quinn?&#8221;
<!--l. 292--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Quinn&#8217;s doing ok. She&#8217;s not really into exercising,
but she does as she&#8217;s told. Unless she sees an
opportunity to skip out, but you know...&#8221;
<!--l. 296--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Does her size cause any problems in class? Even
if I have a written OK from her mother for her to
participate in P.E., I don&#8217;t want to provoke any
problems.&#8221;
<!--l. 302--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Well. She&#8217;s just tall and lanky. For some
exercises that&#8217;s a disadvantage, for others an
advantage. Having her join a basketball game is
almost unfair. It&#8217;s hard to fit her into exercises
requiring a partner of similar build and weight,
because most girls of her weight are a foot
smaller. Ms. Li, is this about her requiring     physiotherapy?&#8221;
 <!--l. 304--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s my concern. But how do you know?&#8221;
 <!--l. 307--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;After school yesterday she was in the gym
 doing her exercises with her sister as coach.
 Believe me, P.E. class is not going to be a
 problem.&#8221;
 <!--l. 309--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Well, OK then. As you mentioned her, what
 about Daria?&#8221;
 <!--l. 313--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Daria is doing good, but not excellent. Don&#8217;t
 misunderstand me, she&#8217;s an outstanding sportsman.
 Sportswoman. It&#8217;s just that the girls P.E. exercises
 don&#8217;t fit her.&#8221;
 <!--l. 315--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Does she participate or...&#8221;
 <!--l. 318--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No, she doesn&#8217;t slack off. You can see that she is
 unhappy with the exercises, but she does as good
 as she can.&#8221;
 <!--l. 320--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Darn. Can&#8217;t get her for that.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Well, seeing she&#8217;s an &#8216;outstanding sportswoman&#8217;,
 do you recommend her for any teams so that she
 could add to the glory of Lawndale High?&#8221;
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">And we keep her occupied.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 328--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Unless we&#8217;re having a women&#8217;s wrestling team I
 don&#8217;t know about, no. Forget anything like
 gymnastics or cheerleading. She&#8217;s too bulky for
 volleyball and basketball, and even if we had a
 women&#8217;s soccer team, I&#8217;d not expect her to do any
 good.&#8221;
 <!--l. 330--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Nothing else?&#8221; Ms. Li was not pleased.
 <!--l. 333--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Really not. But I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s going to be a
 regular at the gym and likely does some training
 outside of school, so I don&#8217;t see a problem.&#8221;
 <!--l. 336--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;d like to get her involved in school sports. My,
 aeh, our school&#8217;s sports.&#8221;
 <!--l. 339--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hmm. &#8216;Involved&#8217; does not necessarily mean &#8216;on
 the team&#8217;? I may have an idea.&#8221;
 <!--l. 342--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;On a team would be better. On a team where
 she&#8217;d excel in public would be much better.&#8221;
 <!--l. 345--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;ve no idea what team could suit her. But give
 me another week, and I may have an idea to
 involve her in school sports.&#8221;
 <!--l. 350--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Ms. Morris, I&#8217;m not pleased by your inability to
 recommend a suitable sport to push her on the
 team. However, &#8216;involving&#8217; her in school sports
 would be better than nothing. I expect your
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
answer a week from now. We must occupy her
immediately after she tests out of the self-esteem
class!&#8221;
<!--l. 352--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">So that&#8217;s your real intention.</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;You&#8217;ll get my proposal next week, unless my
initial assessment of her was wrong and my idea
wouldn&#8217;t work out.&#8221;
<!--l. 356--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Well, then goodbye Ms. Morris.&#8221;
<!--l. 359--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">What is it about Daria that irks her? I&#8217;ll have a</span>

<!--l. 361--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-10000"></a>*****</h4>
<!--l. 363--><p class="noindent" >Daria put down the equipment she had with her
and locked the door of Quinn&#8217;s room. There was
no need for their parents to accidentally witness
this event.
<!--l. 368--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Daria, I have sore muscles in places I didn&#8217;t even
knew I had muscles. You nearly wrecked me and
those pain killers didn&#8217;t work shit.&#8221; Quinn
said as she removed her shirt and bra. Until
two weeks ago they had shared a room, and
there were few secrets between them in that
way.
<!--l. 373--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You took them and should be lucky that you
didn&#8217;t go without. The trousers need to go as
well, they&#8217;ll get stained otherwise.&#8221;
<!--l. 375--><p class="noindent" >Quinn removed her trousers as well and moved
just clad in cotton panties and socks towards her
bed.
<!--l. 378--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Daria, what&#8217;s the towel doing on the bedside
carpet?&#8221;
<!--l. 381--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Your bed won&#8217;t work, Quinn. A massage requires
a hard underground so I won&#8217;t just push you into
the padding. Lie down.&#8221;
<!--l. 383--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Do I get a cushion?&#8221;
<!--l. 386--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No, that would give you a sore neck. But maybe
you want to add that to your collection of
sore...&#8221;
<!--l. 388--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Just shut up.&#8221; Quinn did as she was told and lay
on her tummy on the towel. Daria sat across
Quinn&#8217;s thighs who startled a little at this.     <!--l. 391--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">I&#8217;m just in my panties! That must look so...</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Oh, Daria, is that necessary, that&#8217;s a ...&#8221;
 <!--l. 394--><p class="noindent" >Daria carefully moved some stray strands of
 Quinn&#8217;s hair to the side and smirked as she saw
 the blush spread across Quinn&#8217;s shoulders.
 Redheads were really handicapped in that
 aspect.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;..little dominating. But without a massage bench
 I need that position to exert the proper force.
 Should I stop?&#8221;
 <!--l. 400--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No, go on.&#8221; Daria was the only person Quinn was
 comfortable submitting to to that extent.
 <!--l. 403--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Darn. But it was worth a try.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Caution, the oil could be a little cold, but off we
 go.&#8221;
 <!--l. 406--><p class="noindent" >Daria poured a little bit of the massage oil she
 had borrowed from her parents&#8217; bedroom into her
 hands, warmed it a little and started to work on
 Quinn&#8217;s back. Its citric smell was rather pleasant
 and comforting.
 <!--l. 411--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hmm, Daria that is not too cold. Nice... That&#8217;s
 heavenly... Ouch! Daria stay clear of my spine!&#8221;
 <!--l. 413--><p class="noindent" >Quinn wiggled a little but noted that she would
 not be going anywhere. Accepting a massage
 required a lot more trust than she had expected.
 <!--l. 417--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Following the &#8216;don&#8217;ts&#8217; makes it easy to make sure</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">Quinn will never ask for this again.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 419--><p class="noindent" >Daria moved in three more times on Quinn&#8217;s spine
 right at the beginning, which seemed to be as
 uncomfortable as the book said. Then she started
 to run properly through the described motions. It
 was not that hard, and after a while she got the
 hang of it. That really required a lot of power in
 the arms.
 <!--l. 424--><p class="noindent" >The first three minutes Quinn was all &#8216;oh&#8217;ing and
 &#8216;ah&#8217;ing but then fell silent. After five minutes
 Quinn&#8217;s breathing became tell-tale slow. After
 seven minutes she started to snore slightly. After
 eight minutes Daria removed her hands from the
 putty called Quinn and cleaned them on the towel
 that her sister rested on. She put another towel on
 Quinn&#8217;s bed, lifted Quinn carefully enough not to
 wake her onto it and covered her with the towel
 from the floor. Finally she put the duvet over her

<!--l. 436--><p class="noindent" >Daria went silently to her room, retrieved an old
insta-matic camera and returned to her sister&#8217;s
room. After turning the bedside clock so the time
would be visible, she shot a single picture. As she
left the room for the second time, she switched
the lights off. The picture came out really well,
the dusk seen through the window underlined the
unfashionable timeframe.
<!--l. 446--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span

10:1 that this was a camouflaged poker round.
Daria did not mind as long as she got a lift out of

lost too much.

 normal guys that wanted to be able to save their
 butts and some vets that wanted to stay in shape.
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
Everyone introduced themselves, but she did not
even bother with the names. They would be using
the nicknames anyway. Here Daria was Tiny
and just the second girl among about fifteen
people.
<!--l. 506--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;&#8216;Tiny&#8217;, hmm? Got that one by a blind man?&#8221; was
the first question one of the guys asked her while
stretching his arms.
<!--l. 509--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No, when I got that nickname I was less than
DeeDee here.&#8221; Daria said, pointing at the other
girl in the group. &#8216;DeeDee&#8217; was a small blonde
woman of about 120 pounds in her late twenties.
<br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">No doubt how she got named &#8216;DD&#8217;.</span>&#187; Daria
thought looking at her.
<!--l. 514--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;That was, like, ten years ago?&#8221; asked another
man of the group.
<!--l. 517--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No, just three. And listen, guys, so I don&#8217;t have
to repeat myself a dozen times: I&#8217;m 6&#8217;3" and
about 190 pounds.&#8221;
<!--l. 519--><p class="noindent" >The guys gave her a measuring once-over; their
practiced eyes evaluated her - as an opponent and
sparring partner.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;No doubt about that. You&#8217;ve been practicing
three years?&#8221;
<!--l. 523--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yes; that&#8217;s part of the reason for that.&#8221; Daria
answered pointing at herself.
<!--l. 526--><p class="noindent" >Raynolds spoke up. &#8220;Enough small talk. Lets get
going, people. You know what to do. Tiny, you&#8217;re
with me. I need to see what you can do and what
not.&#8221;
<!--l. 529--><p class="noindent" >That said, the crowd scattered along the empty
parking lot and they began warming up and doing
basic exercises in smaller groups or on their own.
Daria warmed up with Raynolds and he started
testing her level. After about ten minutes and
some painful levers they stopped and Daria
found about half of the group watching them.
Whoever she made eye contact with gave an
approving nod and resumed training. In this
group, Daria was welcome. Here she did fit in.
Here she was average. There was no more gawking
afterwards.
                                            <!--l. 537--><p class="noindent" >
 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-13000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 539--><p class="noindent" >The guys did not pay Daria more attention than
 they did to anybody else. DeeDee was a different
 story all together. Being the lightest person
 around, DeeDee had a hard time during training.
 Her well honed technique and her fast reflexes
 were her only weapons against her sparring
 partners. She was incredible happy to see another
 female in the group.
 <!--l. 549--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Tiny, the guys are great and give me as much as
 I can take, but you should see how embarrassed
 they get when they happen to touch me in
 &#8216;inappropriate&#8217; places during the training. They
 know as well as I do that it does just happen, but
 ... you know. Training new moves is going to be so
 much more fun with you!&#8221;
 <!--l. 551--><p class="noindent" >DeeDee was a chatterbox and told Daria about
 herself during their breaks. She was here to learn
 effective self defense, and unlike her older husband
 she didn&#8217;t like guns. He had brought a son and
 a daughter into the marriage. Daria did not
 really listen to her but focussed on the others
 training to get to know the other members of the
 chapter.
 <!--l. 557--><p class="noindent" >Given the guys frame, DeeDee had a real problem.
 When Daria asked about that, DeeDee stated
 she didn&#8217;t mind being in size-, weight, and
 strength-wise disadvantage all the time.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;I don&#8217;t expect any mugger to care about having
 an unfair advantage. This is the most realistic
 training I can get.&#8221;
 <!--l. 563--><p class="noindent" >The training was hard. Raynolds was right, this
 bunch were the enthusiasts. Daria&#8217;s skill was
 in the upper middle of the group, and she
 would surely be able to learn a thing or two.
 The guys initially handled her like they did
 DeeDee, but no one did so twice. Daria did
 not hesitate to take whatever advantage was
 presented to her and subdued her opponents.
 Once they realized that she might be a girl, but
 was on their level, even in strength, the guys
 sparred with her as an equal and the training was
 challenging.
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
<!--l. 571--><p class="noindent" >Sparring in the parking lot was nasty. Once you
fell, the tarmac was hard and rough. Her thick
clothing did dampen the falls a little, but Daria
was sure to have her share of bruises. Luckily,
nothing tore open and she did not chafe her knees
and hands. However she hit her head on the
ground once causing her scalp to bleed a little.
But if you were attacked, you had no choice in the
location, so dealing with it in training was the
right thing to do.
<!--l. 578--><p class="noindent" >Amid the chatter DeeDee dropped that she was
from Lawndale. While Dd did not seem to be the
type of person that Daria would befriend, she
was willing to compromise for a chance to
carpool.
<!--l. 582--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;m from Lawndale as well. You&#8217;re here by
car?&#8221;
<!--l. 585--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yes; you too? Maybe we can carpool. Riding
together would be even more fun.&#8221;
<!--l. 587--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Must be my lucky day, I didn&#8217;t even have to bring</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">it up.</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;No, I neither have a license nor a car. But riding
together sounds good.&#8221;
<!--l. 591--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Which days are you going to attend? I&#8217;m
training Monday and Friday.&#8221;
<!--l. 594--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I was planning Monday and Thursday. So we
could ride together on Mondays.&#8221;
<!--l. 596--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hmmm. Mondays is a done deal, but let me
think about it...&#8221;
<!--l. 598--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to ... sorry, my turn again.&#8221;
<!--l. 600--><p class="noindent" >Daria joined another sparring session, but managed
to organize the ride with DeeDee. DeeDee lived at
Crewe Neck, one of Lawndale&#8217;s upper class gated
communities, and offered to pick Daria up. Daria
declined as she did not want to impose and said
she&#8217;d be at the community gate twenty to
seven on the coming Monday. They exchanged
phone numbers - Daria got DeeDee&#8217;s cell&#8217;s
number - to stay in contact in case of last-minute
changes.
<!--l. 607--><p class="noindent" >                                            <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-14000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 609--><p class="noindent" >Quinn slowly drifted back into consciousness and
 was seriously confused. She felt great, relaxed, her
 muscles didn&#8217;t ache as bad as before anymore, she
 was warm and comfortable. But she had no idea
 where she was or how she got there. Slowly
 she started to get the facts straight. She was
 in her bed, under her comforter with some
 additional towels, hence the comfortable warmth.
 Then she noted that she was not appropriately
 dressed.
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">I&#8217;d never get into bed without my PJs!</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 617--><p class="noindent" >The look at her bedside clock shocked her. It
 was nearly 10 o&#8217;clock. She wrapped one of
 the towels around her shoulders, got up and
 walked over to the bathroom. That late, she
 could just get ready for bed - properly, this
 time. The wheels in her mind started to turn.
 She got her massage from Daria, that made
 her relaxed and eased her sore muscles. And
 she likely had fallen asleep under her sister&#8217;s
 hands.
 <!--l. 624--><p class="noindent" >She felt embarrassed as she came to the conclusion
 that Daria must have put her into bed and
 covered her without her noticing.
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Falling asleep like that, being put to bed like that.</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">Just like a baby.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 628--><p class="noindent" >Suddenly she saw the connection between the deal
 with Daria, the hard training she had been given,
 and the massage. Daria had managed to steal
 her Friday evening. Daria had babied her in
 order to hammer her place as &#8216;baby sister&#8217;
 really home. And to top everything, Daria had
 left her in an embarrasing state. Quinn had
 been had really good, and she was seriously
 displeased with her sister. She went downstairs
 to have a little snack while watching some
 TV.
 <!--l. 635--><p class="noindent" >
 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-15000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 637--><p class="noindent" >Once the training finished, the group dissolved
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
under numerous goodbyes. Daria had gotten a
nice workout and was sweaty, so she pulled over
the additional sweater and put a towel on her
head and shoulders. DeeDee bode farewell and
vanished in her car while Daria approached the
sidewalk along the main street. Daria walked up
and down to stay warm, drinking from her water
bottle. Her father arrived five minutes later, a
little after ten.
<!--l. 644--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hi kiddo, get in and let&#8217;s get home.&#8221;
<!--l. 646--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Kiddo my ass.</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Hi dad. I need a shower and my bed.&#8221;
<!--l. 649--><p class="noindent" >They rode a while in silence with only Jake&#8217;s
country station softly playing on the radio.
<!--l. 652--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;How was the training?&#8221;
<!--l. 656--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Good. It&#8217;s a nice group, and I&#8217;m going to make
some progress with them. I think I managed to
get a ride on Mondays with one of the other
students. We&#8217;ll see how that works out.&#8221;
<!--l. 658--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;That&#8217;s great!&#8221;
<!--l. 660--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Let&#8217;s have a look what you&#8217;ve been up to...</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;How was your poker round, dad?&#8221;
<!--l. 663--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Great, I came out hundred bucks ahe...&#8221; Jake
stopped himself as he realized what he just
blurted out. He looked sheepishly at his daughter
who smirked at him.
<!--l. 667--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Gocha!</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;So the &#8216;businessmen&#8217;s meeting&#8217; went well?&#8221;
<!--l. 671--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yes. And I did network some. Really, things like
that help business. Daria, please don&#8217;t tell your
mother...&#8221;
<!--l. 673--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Well, I suppose there is no real need to tell
her...&#8221; Daria still smirked at her father and had
now a wicked gleam in her eyes. She had him
really in the hot seat.
<br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Better me than mom.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 678--><p class="noindent" >Jake knew that smile. It was the smile Helen had
when she had someone cornered for good. He did
not have to ask, a share of his prize would ensure
Daria&#8217;s discretion.
<!--l. 682--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You&#8217;re so much like your mother, Daria.&#8221;
<!--l. 684--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">No. She&#8217;d take all the money AND yell at</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">you.</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;A gentleman does not compare a woman to hermother. But coming from you I take that as an
 honest compliment.&#8221;
 <!--l. 688--><p class="noindent" >They rode in silence until they reached Lawndale&#8217;s
 city limit.
 <!--l. 690--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Are you going to attend the &#8216;meeting&#8217; next week
 again, dad?&#8221;
 <!--l. 692--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Maybe&#8221; was Jake&#8217;s meek answer.
 <!--l. 694--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I still have to work out a second ride. Maybe I&#8217;ll
 ask you again.&#8221;
 <!--l. 696--><p class="noindent" >Jake parked the Lexus in the Morgendorffer&#8217;s
 driveway, counted three tenners from his wallet
 once he stopped the engine and gave them to
 Daria.
 <!--l. 699--><p class="noindent" >Daria was puzzled, she hadn&#8217;t even asked for
 &#8216;compensation&#8217;, but her father had a point, this
 would get him into serious trouble. A short
 internal struggle later, Daria handed, to Jake&#8217;s
 visible amazement, two bills back.
 <!--l. 704--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Think of it as a fee for the ride. And I want you
 to win some more next week. Just remember not
 to let mom throw you off your guard.&#8221;
 <!--l. 706--><p class="noindent" >The smirk between Daria and him told Jake that
 everything was all right.
 <!--l. 708--><p class="noindent" >
 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-16000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 710--><p class="noindent" >Daria did not dawdle and got under the shower
 after a short &#8220;Hello&#8221; to her mother in the den.
 When she came back down to have a small snack
 and a soda, Quinn, in pajamas, sat on the sofa
 watching TV at low level. Her mother was still
 busy with her papers. Noticing her presence,
 Quinn shot Daria a nasty glance.
 <!--l. 716--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Napped well, sis?&#8221; Daria smirked.
 <!--l. 718--><p class="noindent" >Quinn did not dignify that with an answer, but it
 was obvious that she was peeved. Daria would
 never understand what her problem with sleeping
 naked was. Their mother did not even look up
 from her files.
 <!--l. 722--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;m gonna go up to my room to catch some zzz&#8217;s
 as well. &#8217;night&#8221;
 <!--l. 724--><p class="noindent" >A &#8220;Goodnight&#8221; from her mother accompanied
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
Daria on her way to the staircase, and was joined
by the &#8220;Goodnight&#8221; of her father, who was busy
in the kitchen. Likely fixing himself a drink to
celebrate his poker win - and not getting busted
by Helen.
