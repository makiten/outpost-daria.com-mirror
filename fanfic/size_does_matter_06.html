 <!--l. 14--><p class="noindent" ><a

 <!--l. 16--><p class="noindent" >Daria sat at the breakfast table working her way
 through the weekend edition of the newspaper
 when Quinn came down. It was nearly eleven
 o&#8217;clock and she was still clad in pajamas and had
 a serious case of bed-hair. Their mother was in
 the den, engrossed in her case files again and their
 father was out to do some shopping.
 <!--l. 22--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Mornin&#8217; sunshine!&#8221;
 <!--l. 28--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Cut it out! You stole my Friday evening and my
 complete sleep rhythm is off. All thanks to the
 &#8216;nice&#8217; nap you let me have! After I woke up again
 I couldn&#8217;t get back to sleep until 3am! And when I
 woke up yesterday evening, I was all nekkid! Why
 didn&#8217;t you dress me! And my muscles still hurt
 from Thursday if I move the wrong way! My life is
 ruined!&#8221;
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
<!--l. 30--><p class="noindent" >Daria put the newspaper down.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Well, you insisted on...&#8221;
<!--l. 34--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;That&#8217;s not the point! What if someone walked
into my room and saw me? It&#8217;s over, things can&#8217;t
get any worse!&#8221;
<!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Someone could have seen you... and taken a
picture.&#8221;
<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Haha, Daria. And he could have infected me with
ebola. You fail even as a misery chick.&#8221;
<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >Daria raised an eyebrow. Quinn was more upset
than she had expected. Quinn picked up a
bowl, some cereal and milk and started her own
breakfast in silence. She pointedly look anywhere
but at her sister.
<!--l. 45--><p class="noindent" >Daria was astonished by Quinn&#8217;s acerbic manners
and could only guess why Quinn was so upset.
<br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">OK, I had had her with the massage, but</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">otherwise... she&#8217;s mad at the world and I&#8217;m just a</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">convenient target. No dates, no friends, new</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">school and home, and tons of school work. Let&#8217;s</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">see if I can lighten her mood a little.</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;What do you think of the cafeteria food at
school?&#8221;
<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Sucks.&#8221;
<br class="newline" />Quinn continued to sulk, but was now glancing at
her sister every now and then. Daria put her
glasses down and massaged the bridge of her
nose.
<!--l. 58--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I agree. I&#8217;m thinking of storing some cans of dog
food in my locker as an alternative for the really
bad days. I&#8217;d be healthier as well.&#8221;
<!--l. 60--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;<span 
class="ecbx-1095">EWWWW </span>Daria, I&#8217;m, like, eating here!&#8221;
<!--l. 62--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Let&#8217;s extend the olive branch.</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;I&#8217;ll give the cafeteria another chance next week.
If things don&#8217;t improve, it&#8217;s brown-bagging for me
from then on.&#8221;
<!--l. 66--><p class="noindent" >Quinn was torn. Daria had played a bad trick on
her last evening, but keeping the cold shoulder
treatment up right now could mean school lunch
for a long time. Bad, icky, fattening school lunch.
But she would not swallow the bait Daria had put
out that easily.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;One could have a healthy selection of fruits and
some vegetable sticks.&#8221;                        <!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Gotcha. You want to. You just don&#8217;t want to</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">admit it.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;I doubt mom or dad would prepare lunch for us
 every morning.&#8221;
 <!--l. 75--><p class="noindent" >Quinn focussed her attention on her cereal. Daria
 decided to dangle the bait a little longer.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;That&#8217;d mean getting up 10 minutes earlier. At
 least.&#8221;
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">I could get up only 20 minutes after you. What a</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">bummer.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" >Quinn managed to resist the temptation. &#8220;Well,
 maybe the food will improve.&#8221;
 <!--l. 83--><p class="noindent" >Daria picked her glasses up again and returned to
 reading the paper after Quinn did not take the
 bait. She was sure that it was only a matter of
 time until she would; Quinn was too picky about
 her food to stay on that cafeteria lunch if she had
 the option to avoid it. That would come at a
 price, obviously. Daria would need some time to
 think of appropriate compensation.
 <!--l. 89--><p class="noindent" >After the breakfast and the paper Daria retreated
 into her room and started to work through her
 homework. Getting it out of the way would free
 the entire remaining weekend for leisure. Her
 diary was in need of an update, and there was still
 the issue with the phone lines. She heard Quinn
 enter their bathroom before her world reduced
 itself to math problems.
 <!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" >
 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 97--><p class="noindent" >After her breakfast Quinn stepped into the
 bathroom to take a shower. Her image in mirror
 looked simply bad.
 <!--l. 101--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">I look horrible. Thank god only Daria saw me -</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">and she doesn&#8217;t give much for appearance.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 103--><p class="noindent" >The shower was refreshing, but Quinn noted again
 that the room needed some remodelling. The
 showerhead was far too low for people of her size,
 as was the shower curtain once she lifted the
 nozzle to wash her hair. It would take a while to
 adjust the house.
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
<!--l. 108--><p class="noindent" >Her prospects for the weekend were rather dull.
Catching up with the missing two weeks of
schoolwork did not provide that big a challenge.
Combined with the effort she had put in during
the week, she should have been able to arrive on
par by late evening today. But thanks to the loss
of large parts of Thursday and Friday evening,
she&#8217;d be more or less busy until Sunday evening.
Then there was the middle school reading list that
differed a little from the one in Texas. That meant
that she had some books to read in order to fill
the gaps that could open during her English class.
She wasn&#8217;t Daria who had likely read half of all
existing books by now. That would be time
consuming and totally boring. Plus she had to
start to take notes of the books, Daria had
had a point there. That was time consuming
right now, but would prove efficient in the long
run.
<!--l. 121--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>*****</h4>
<!--l. 123--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Daria.&#8221;
<!--l. 125--><p class="noindent" >Daria hadn&#8217;t noticed her mother entering her
room. Her entering Daria&#8217;s own turf was rare,
so something was up. The sounds of running
water told Daria that her sister was taking a
shower.
<!--l. 129--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Mom?&#8221;
<!--l. 131--><p class="noindent" >Daria refocussed her attention on her mother.
Helen wouldn&#8217;t interrupt her work if this wasn&#8217;t
important. Her mother&#8217;s choice of an opportunity
without Quinn and Jake around indicated that
she expected resistance. She didn&#8217;t want any
witnesses.
<!--l. 136--><p class="noindent" >Helen did not beat around the bush. She wanted
to get this issue over with.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Daria, I think you should take up seeing a
professional psychologist again.&#8221;
<br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">And if I start this the right way, the bill will be</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">covered entirely by the insurance.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 144--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Damn. But that was a sure bet since that bloody</span><span 
class="ecti-1095">shrink put me into the freak show on Monday.</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">And her mind is set on it. Stay reasonable.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Mom, I&#8217;ve been seeing ...&#8221;
 <!--l. 147--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;...a psychologist for some time. You have and it
 did help you.&#8221;
 <!--l. 149--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Then...?&#8221;
 <!--l. 151--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Continuing will help you further.&#8221;
 <!--l. 153--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think that&#8217;d be a waste of time and
 money?&#8221;
 <!--l. 155--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Not my time, not my money.</span>&#187; &#8220;If I did I
 wouldn&#8217;t send you. You&#8217;re going to profit from
 it.&#8221;
 <!--l. 158--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I need them anymore.&#8221;
 <!--l. 161--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Daria, please face the facts. You being sent to
 some self-esteem class as the first thing at your
 new school shows that you still need some
 guidance.&#8221;
 <!--l. 163--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;That damn shrink&#8217;s a quack and wanted to pay
 me back!&#8221;
 <!--l. 165--><p class="noindent" >Helen backed a step away at Daria&#8217;s angry
 outburst, but not on the matter. One more reason
 to keep Daria under surveillance.
 <!--l. 170--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You&#8217;re smart enough to avoid such situations
 to begin with and rejected <span 
class="ecbx-1095">my </span>help after it
 happened. I&#8217;m not going to send you to some

 <!--l. 176--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Daria, you will be going, end of discussion.
 And rest assured that I&#8217;ll have a close eye on
 Quinn.&#8221;

 you know that I can&#8217;t make any promises about
 that. OK?&#8221;

mom.&#8221;
<!--l. 194--><p class="noindent" >That said, Helen left Daria&#8217;s room again, likely to
return to her files. Daria was not completely
surprised by her mother&#8217;s announcement. She had
that inkling ever since she could not get out of
that friggin&#8217; psych exam on Monday. One more
day a week that went down the drain. She <span 
class="ecbx-1095">had </span>to
get out of that brain dead after-school class &#8212;
ASAFP.
<!--l. 200--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a>*****</h4>
<!--l. 202--><p class="noindent" >Quinn looked back at her week while the shower&#8217;s
warm water relaxed her. She had not made any
friends by now, but was hopeful that this was
going to change soon. Stacy seemed to be a nice
girl, once she was away from Sandi. They seemed
to share some interests as well and Stacy luckily
did not immediately see her as a threat. When it
came to making female friends her looks were
really a handicap. She had already overheard
some really nasty remarks from other girls
concerning herself. Things at middle school
had been much easier with Daria paving her
way.
<!--l. 211--><p class="noindent" >Sandi was the most high-strung bitch Quinn had
ever encountered so far. That girl had some real
issues. If it wasn&#8217;t for their common interest in
fashion and the tolerable other girls around her,
Quinn would not associate with her. Sandi was
building a serious powerbase in the circle of the
popular, but while this was a good reason for
many girls to bow to Sandi&#8217;s regiment that was
not a necessity for Quinn. Given her looks, the
question was not if she was popular or not,
but just how popular she was going to be.
If Sandi would accept that fact and adopt a
live-and-let-live policy, they should be able to get
along. And Quinn doubted that she would ever
develop any interest in Sandi beyond &#8216;get along
with&#8217;.
<!--l. 222--><p class="noindent" >Then there was the third girl of the fashion club,Tiffany. She was beautiful like a delicate china
 doll and as talkative. Quinn wondered what her
 problem was, and came up with several possible
 reasons. All of them were highly uncomfortable,
 so Quinn decided to deal with that issue later.
 Much later.
 <!--l. 227--><p class="noindent" >To Quinn&#8217;s chagrin the male population of LHS
 had not reacted to her arrival as she would have
 preferred. At middle school, the male students
 adored her, and she had revelled in it. During the
 last week she had seen guys drool far too often.
 But no one had made the effort to actually
 talk to her. It would take a while to settle in.
 High school was different from middle school.
 Some of the questions Ms. Manson had asked
 on Monday started to make a lot more sense
 now.
 <!--l. 235--><p class="noindent" >Her mind wandered back to her school work. She
 could bother less, but her mother made a point at
 tying her spending, time and money, to her
 scholastic performance. Anything worse than a
 C would be really frowned upon - including
 money-wise. Quinn was not keen to find out the
 result of a less than C average at midterms or
 even the finals would look like. Having a major
 brain like Daria around did not help either. With
 her parents, that was.
 <!--l. 242--><p class="noindent" >Secondary literature was likely the way to go. She
 wasn&#8217;t required to know the books, but about the
 books. And preprocessed information would
 be easier to absorb and thus more efficient.
 She&#8217;d had to ask Daria about that. That was
 a perk of having a major brain around the
 house.

 <!--l. 249--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Quinn?&#8221;
 <!--l. 251--><p class="noindent" >Helen looked into her younger daughter&#8217;s room
 and found her unmoving on her bed. Quinn
 looked up, and the opened book in her hand made
 clear that she had been taking a break from
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
reading.
<!--l. 255--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yes, mom?&#8221;
<!--l. 258--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I need a break, and still have some things I need
to buy. I&#8217;m heading over to the mall, you want to
join?&#8221;
<!--l. 260--><p class="noindent" >That was an offer Quinn could not resist. She had
hardly been out all week, and the reading was
getting to her. A trip to the mall was a welcome
interruption of her day. She immediately gave in
to the temptation.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Give me five minutes!&#8221;
<!--l. 265--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait downstairs.&#8221;
<br class="newline" />Helen left Quinn&#8217;s room, closed the door, and
looked down the hallway towards Daria&#8217;s door.
Even if she already knew the outcome, she
could not skip asking Daria to join in as well.
Helen sighed. Appeasement did not go well with
Daria.

<!--l. 273--><p class="noindent" >Five minutes later, a properly dressed Quinn and
her mother mounted the SAV and set off. A block
down the street it registered with Quinn that it
was just the two of them.
<!--l. 277--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Didn&#8217;t Daria want to come?&#8221;
<!--l. 280--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Daria was &#8216;busy&#8217;. She isn&#8217;t in the mood to spend
time with me right now.&#8221;
<!--l. 282--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hu? What happened?&#8221;
<!--l. 284--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;m having her see a psychologist again.&#8221;
<!--l. 286--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Oh.&#8221; Quinn did not like that. If her sister
was sent there again, she was not too far off
herself.
<!--l. 289--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t sure until we got that message on
Monday.&#8221;
<!--l. 291--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I think she&#8217;s doing better now.&#8221;
<!--l. 294--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;If she is it doesn&#8217;t show. Otherwise she would not
have been diagnosed with low self-esteem.&#8221;
<!--l. 296--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;From <span 
class="ecbx-1095">that </span>interview, mom?&#8221;
<!--l. 300--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;The school psychologist meets the requirements
of the county school board and is approved by the
PTA. I seriously doubt this Ms. Li would tolerateany incompetence at her school.&#8221;
 <!--l. 303--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">I don&#8217;t think competence is her top requirement</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">for employment - not by a loooong way.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;I don&#8217;t think Daria&#8217;s happy about that.&#8221;
 <!--l. 308--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Of course not. Only a total nutcase would be
 happy to have psychological problems. And don&#8217;t
 think <span 
class="ecbx-1095">I </span>am happy about that. It&#8217;s my, our money
 and my time.&#8221;
 <!--l. 310--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Maybe she&#8217;ll get better quick.&#8221;
 <!--l. 312--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;She better.&#8221;
 <!--l. 314--><p class="noindent" >The conversation did dampen Quinn&#8217;s mood a
 little, but with this being her first trip to the local
 mall Quinn was still excited. She was aware that
 this would give her some serious exposure and,
 with this being around lunchtime on a Saturday,
 she would likely be spotted by some students of
 LHS.
 <!--l. 319--><p class="noindent" >
 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-8000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 321--><p class="noindent" >Daria went into the kitchen to make herself
 a sandwich for lunch. It had taken a while
 to take her mind off her renewed visits to a
 shrink, but once she was focussed again she
 made quick progress with her homework. After
 lunch, there was just some report to write for
 that Ms. Barch in science, and she would be
 done.
 <!--l. 327--><p class="noindent" >With her sister and her mother gone, she realized
 that she was alone in the new house for the first
 time. Daria took the opportunity to listen to the
 house. With pleasant autumn weather outside
 without any wind, there were hardly any sounds
 from the roof truss or the walls. There weren&#8217;t
 many noises on the outside as well. A dog barked
 some houses down the street but no cars were
 heard passing.
 <!--l. 334--><p class="noindent" >
 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-9000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 336--><p class="noindent" >Quinn and Helen split up immediately after they
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
entered the mall and arranged to meet up an hour
later in the food court to have some lunch. Quinn
had had breakfast late and was fine with that.
The food court should have something to her
liking.
<!--l. 341--><p class="noindent" >Helen set off to work through the list she had
prepared, but Quinn was set to just browse. She
got her share of stares as she walked through the
hallways. Being tall had its perks in such an
environment. With her eyes well above the heads
of the crowd she had no problem in spotting the
interesting stores even on the opposite side of the
building.
<!--l. 347--><p class="noindent" >The mall was small, but catered to all needs. All
major chain stores had a branch, yet Quinn was
not optimistic to get a great shopping experience.
For someone of her size, even the big-and-tall
stores had only a spartan selection.
<br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Spartan in every sense.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 353--><p class="noindent" >On her expedition she passed several teens
that seemed familiar to her, but she steered
clear of the more popular hangouts like the
record store. Right now, she wasn&#8217;t here for
socializing but just to get to know the place.
While looking at the display she noted a guy, a
senior or college freshman, looking at her. She
wouldn&#8217;t have spent any addition attention
on him if she hadn&#8217;t seen the displeased girl
approaching him from behind. Quinn threw her
hair and shifted her hip to look at another item
in order to set things in motion. The guy&#8217;s
smile widened, the girl became infuriated once
she arrived at the guy, and Quinn decided
to make her exit before things turned really
ugly.
<br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Thank heavens, it still works.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 364--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-10000"></a>*****</h4>
<!--l. 366--><p class="noindent" >Quinn arrived a little early at the food court
and spent the time waiting for her mother
looking at the food options and watching the   other patrons. There were a couple of students
 from her grade sitting in one booth. Geeks
 - not the crowd she would like to associate
 with.
 <!--l. 371--><p class="noindent" >Quinn spotted her mother, laden with several
 bags of loot, from far away and moved towards
 the entrance of the food court she would use.
 They secured a small table and Helen sat down
 immediately.
 <!--l. 376--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Here&#8217;s money Quinn. Get me some chicken
 burrito combo with a cola and yourself whatever
 you like. I need some rest and will stay here with
 the bags.&#8221;
 <!--l. 378--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yes mom.&#8221;
 <!--l. 380--><p class="noindent" >Helen&#8217;s choice of a TexMex place was ok for
 Quinn. She could get herself some ensalada thingy
 with some something on the side. No cheese or
 cream, though. The order line advanced fast,
 and Quinn quickly returned to the table with
 a laden tray and handed back the change.
 Helen dug in immediately, she was obviously
 hungry.
 <!--l. 386--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Mom, hasty eating will make you fat.&#8221;
 <!--l. 389--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Quinn, I haven&#8217;t eaten since breakfast, and that
 was before eight. I&#8217;m starving here.&#8221;
 <!--l. 391--><p class="noindent" >Quinn took a sip from her diet soda. &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s
 still not healthy.&#8221;
 <!--l. 394--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Lets make a deal: You don&#8217;t comment on
 my eating habits and I won&#8217;t comment on
 yours.&#8221;
 <!--l. 396--><p class="noindent" >Quinn just nodded. There hadn&#8217;t been a single
 visit to the doctor that didn&#8217;t included the
 phrase &#8216;You should gain a little weight&#8217;. Luckily
 they never said that her low weight was a
 problem, because otherwise her mother would
 have immediately force-fed her. Or more likely
 outsourced that task to Daria. Gaining weight
 was not something Quinn was looking forward
 to.
 <!--l. 402--><p class="noindent" >Mother and daughter continued their meal in
 silence and watched the crowd around them.

<!--l. 407--><p class="noindent" >Several eye pairs from the crowd watched back.
Some LHS students had lunch at the food court
as well and could not fail to notice Quinn&#8217;s
presence.
<!--l. 410--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You see those two over there?&#8221;
<!--l. 412--><p class="noindent" >Following his friend&#8217;s gaze, he immediately
spotted the red hair high above the level of the
other seated peoples&#8217; heads.

<!--l. 416--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yes. Who&#8217;s she with? I can&#8217;t really see the other
person that well.&#8221;
<!--l. 418--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Dunno. She looks rather normal.&#8221;
<!--l. 420--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Friend from school?&#8221;
<!--l. 423--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;What else? Her mother or what? They&#8217;re nothing
alike. Look at the height difference, and the hair
color doesn&#8217;t match a little.&#8221;
<!--l. 425--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;So you know her? Her friend, I mean.&#8221;
<!--l. 428--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No clue who that could be. But what&#8217;s your
interest with her, she&#8217;s rather plain.&#8221;
<!--l. 432--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly why I get the girls first, Corey.
You&#8217;re just not clever enough. She&#8217;s <span

Get to know her, and get introduced to the
hottie.&#8221;

girl is. And starting coming Monday, I&#8217;ll pay a
little extra attention to her.&#8221;
<!--l. 439--><p class="noindent" >The boys ate in silence and kept a constant
surveillance on their targets. Once they had
finished things got interesting. As the girls got up,
the difference between the two of them became
much more palpable. The difference in height -
and age.
<!--l. 444--><p class="noindent" >Corey started to snicker.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Yo, Mr Smart, you gotta thing for older women?
I&#8217;m really looking forward to you hitting on her

 <!--l. 458--><p class="noindent" >On their way back to the car, Helen noticed how
 Quinn consciously forced herself to match her
 pace to Helen&#8217;s. Quinn knew that Helen did not
 really like to be reminded that she was the
 smallest member of the family, and that her &#8216;little
 girls&#8217; were anything but that. They just grew up
 so tremendously, abnormally fast and tall.
 Quinn had turned into an amazing woman
 in an eyeblink, and what had happened to
 Daria was beyond strange. She had a hard
 time seeing that the quiet tiny girl that she
 once had been was still in there - somehow,
 somewhere.
 <!--l. 467--><p class="noindent" >On the ride back home Helen mainly thought
 about her oldest daughter, how she had changed,
 and how far they had drifted apart. She couldn&#8217;t
 do much more for her than send her to see an
 expert to get herself sorted out. Daria was
 an adult in her eyes, and would have to fend
 for herself since she refused any help - as she
 had always done, unless she couldn&#8217;t avoid
 it.
 <!--l. 473--><p class="noindent" >They arrived back at home, and split up again;
 Helen stored her purchases in the appropriate
 places and Quinn returned to her room to
 continue reading &#8211; and now taking notes on &#8211; her
 latest text. Beside some clean dishes in the
 dish rack no hint of Daria&#8217;s presence could be
 found.

 <!--l. 480--><p class="noindent" >As Daria had already suspected, her father
 didn&#8217;t return while she finished her homework.
 She equipped her flashlight and a screwdriver
 from the toolbox in the garage and started the
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
investigation. The first stops were the various
manholes to the cable ducts. Investigating the
attic, which was little more than a crawlspace,
had not the slightest appeal to her.
<!--l. 486--><p class="noindent" >Daria wondered if any Morgendorffer had visited
the attic at all since they had moved in. All
unopened boxes were still stored in the garage -

it.

mother&#8217;s car arrive and two people, likely her
mother and her sister, exit and enter the house.
When she returned to the house herself, her
mother was again in the den, but this time talking
to someone over her cell phone. Likely to her boss
or a coworker about the case she was working
on.
<!--l. 498--><p class="noindent" >Quinn was nowhere to be seen, so she was
likely in her room doing her own homework.
Her father was still out, even if he was not
back once she was finished, she would start
looking at the phone lines on her own. The
phone had been unusually quiet since they
arrived at Lawndale, but Daria was very sure
that this was going to change rather soon -
she decided to enjoy the silence as long as

 Daria found a bottle of meds that, given the
 yellowed label, had been stored there for at
 least a decade or two. Given the amount of
 cobwebs around it, Daria decided not to pick it
 up. No use in getting dirty if she didn&#8217;t need
 to.
 <!--l. 523--><p class="noindent" >Pointing her flashlight at it and squinting, she
 spotted the name &#8216;Nembutal&#8217;, but that gave her
 no idea what that was. After adjusting her glasses
 and squinting some more, Daria identified the
 word &#8216;barbital&#8217; and connected the dots. That was
 likely some high powered sedative the family of
 the mad woman that had inhabited Daria&#8217;s room
 had kept for the more severe attacks. Mostly only
 available on prescription at that time, and most
 likely entirely illegal today. Daria contemplated
 what to do and decided to let sleeping dogs
 lie. It being there did not harm anybody and
 maybe there would be some use for it in the
 future.
 <!--l. 533--><p class="noindent" >Looking through the cable ducts taught her what
 kind of cables were used for the phone, but there
 was no hint at any interruption or defective
 junction. Daria would have to look through the
 attic next, but wasn&#8217;t in the mood for it and
 postponed it to Sunday.
 <!--l. 538--><p class="noindent" >
 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a

 <!--l. 540--><p class="noindent" >The afternoon passed quickly. Quinn was busy
 with her reading list, and was hardly seen outside
 her room. Helen was busy in the den, and didn&#8217;t
 bother any of the girls, so Daria decided to bring
 both of her diaries up to date. After she had
 elevated her room&#8217;s security level from &#8216;high&#8217; to
 &#8216;paranoid&#8217;, she started by writing in her electronic
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
journal. Reviewing the truth made it easier to
come up with credible lies.
<!--l. 547--><p class="noindent" >The scene with Scarlett that really got to her -
like the other times before. How she got even with
Quinn, including the picture in her strategic
reserve. How she missed an operational internet
connection; she knew the school&#8217;s library and
computing lab computers were filtered, and most
likely rigged to record every interaction you
made. But she had not found the cause for the
defective lines in the garage or the air ducts,
her hope was that the attic would hold the
solution.
<!--l. 555--><p class="noindent" >Her other classmates didn&#8217;t give her so much
trouble. The Lane girl acted weird around her and
that red haired kid as well, but Daria wasn&#8217;t sure
if that was just around her or in general. He was
kind of the type for the latter. The survey
she had gotten on Thursday was notable as
well. Daria hoped Quinn would start to realize
the this wasn&#8217;t middle school anymore and
be a little bit more careful than she used to
be.
<!--l. 562--><p class="noindent" >How the smart black guy managed to be on the
football team with that incredibly stupid &#8216;QB&#8217;
was beyond Daria. She would have called the gene
pool boy a long time ago. Their girlfriends, Ms.
Perfect and Ms. Unsinkable, were both a handful.
But Ms. Unsinkable did at least not try to occupy
Daria&#8217;s time.
<!--l. 568--><p class="noindent" >Then there was the incredibly snotty Convertible
Girl; that girl had a lesson in humbleness coming
for her and Daria felt that fate was already
working overtime to arrange this in one way or
another. Daria really pitied the girl, since this
was a lesson she&#8217;d be going to learn the hard
way. &#8216;Hard&#8217; as: Carpet bombing her own little
world.
<!--l. 574--><p class="noindent" >The teachers were an odd bunch. The history
teacher seemed quite amicable later that week, so
likely he had been just testing her. The female
science teacher seemed in desperate need of of
some hormonal release or a straightjacket. Mr
O&#8217;Neill lacked exactly the aggression she had toomuch of.

class="ecti-1095">They should marry. But then, there&#8217;s no men&#8217;s</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">shelter...</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 581--><p class="noindent" >Daria had met the local chapter, and surprisingly
 managed to get a ride immediately. This DeeDee
 girl seemed nice; too nice. Daria was a little wary
 of her, for some reason she could not comprehend
 her.
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Nothing is as simple as it seems.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 586--><p class="noindent" >Catching her father with his poker round was
 really amusing, yet Daria was happy that he had
 already started to make connections to the local
 business world.
 <!--l. 590--><p class="noindent" >Being sent to see a psychologist did not exactly
 surprise Daria after Monday&#8217;s episode with
 the school shrink. Yet, her mother&#8217;s constant
 immersion in her work had her worried a little.
 That had not been the case in Highland. Well, not
 to that extent.
 <!--l. 595--><p class="noindent" >After adding her expectations for attending the
 free for all gym starting next week, she secured
 and obscured her electronic journal again, and
 retrieved its physical counterpart after thoroughly
 checking for hints of anyone accessing it beside
 her.
 <!--l. 600--><p class="noindent" >The written diary was much easier afterwards.
 She spun a tale of extorting protection money
 from that weirdo red head she shared several
 classes with. She was not sure whether having him
 operate the drug distribution at LHS was a bit
 too much, but added a nice twist to things. That
 had potential in the long run.
 <!--l. 606--><p class="noindent" >After she brought the security down to a normal -
 for her, that is - level, she made a quick decision,
 returned to her computer, and fired up the word
 processor. Melody Powers had some infiltration to
 do.

 <!--l. 612--><p class="noindent" >Jane was very content. During the second set
 of Mystik Spiral and well into her third beer
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
(complimentarily provided by Jesse, Nick and
Max - in that order; she would collect the &#8216;Only
one beer, Janey!&#8217; later from Trent) she sat across
the lap of some boy that had chatted her up after
the Spiral left for their set. He had sat down
across from her in the booth the boys had just
left, and they had made fun of the other patrons.
Once Jane cracked some jokes about the band&#8217;s
first song, he did not hold back commenting on
their performance.
<!--l. 621--><p class="noindent" >He was sufficiently cute, about her own age and
rather clean and nicely dressed by the Zon&#8217;s
standards. He asked her to join him for a burger,
and she had excused herself to the restroom
before leaving. Beside performing levitation she
came to the conclusion that he would do for
the evening. The slight buzz from the beer
supported her decision. On her return he sat
rather nervously in the booth. He obviously
expected to be stood up. He was in for a pleasant
surprise.
<!--l. 629--><p class="noindent" >Jane approached the booth with a smile and
entered the bench he was sitting on. Once she sat
beside him, she said &#8220;I know something better
than a burger&#8221;, sat on his lap, and muffled his
protests with a deep kiss. That settled things
rather fast. After Jane had shown him what to do
(and what not to do) they commenced with a
very pleasant making-out-session. Elsewhere that
would have been risque, but in the darkness
of a booth at the Zon their activities were
on the chaste side. Jane enjoyed that very
much, and knew for sure that her partner did as
well.
<!--l. 638--><p class="noindent" >They had not spoken a single word since the first
kiss, and Jane would not have been the one to
stop the activities, but at some point the guy
made very clear that something else required her
attention.

 latching onto his lips wore off, Tom decided to
 play along. No higher brain functions were
 involved in that process. She guided his hands
 and showed him what to do. He was familiar
 with going to second base, but not after 5
 minutes of knowing each other. He knew that this
 was something just for the now, and he felt
 used. But the good kind of used, he was not
 complaining. Hormones at heady levels and her
 black hair blocked out sights and sound from the
 club.
 <!--l. 652--><p class="noindent" >A sudden surge of adrenalin brought him back to
 reality. It took him a second to understand why
 he was suddenly scared shitless, but once his
 brain processed the image of the four guys
 standing in front of the booth and looking at him
 and the girl, he immediately tried to get her off
 him.
 <!--l. 659--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">OMFG! The guys from before, the band. I</span>
 <span

 <!--l. 663--><p class="noindent" >Jane was not happy when the guy started to push
 her away, but she relented. She turned to take a
 look around the club and was a little surprised to
 see the Spiral blocking the booth. They luckily
 did not look angry, but not happy either. Jane
 now understood why the boy&#8217;s interest flagged
 that quickly.
 <!--l. 668--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hi, Trent. Didn&#8217;t see you.&#8221;
 <!--l. 670--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;We&#8217;re packed up and leaving. Want a lift or got
 another ride?&#8221;
 <!--l. 672--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;m coming, Trent.&#8221;
 <!--l. 674--><p class="noindent" >Still glowing, Jane got of the guy&#8217;s lap and left
 the booth. He was obviously too scared to think
 straight. Jane turned around before she crossed
 the rank of Mystik Spiral and bode her toy

<!--l. 682--><p class="noindent" >Still too scared to speak, Tom watched the girl
walk towards the club&#8217;s exit. The guys followed
her, the one with the goatee lingering behind and
shooting him an evil glare. Once the group had
left the club, he started breathing again. He
left the booth and visited the restroom. The
metal mirror revealed numerous smears of the
bright red lipstick she had worn. He cleared
his face with his handkerchief, rearranged his
hair and his clothes. The result was far from
perfect but had hidden the most obvious signs of
their debauchery. Back at the bar he ordered
himself a soda, drank it rather fast as he tried to
sort out his thoughts. They didn&#8217;t even know
each other&#8217;s name. His conclusion was to file
that encounter under &#8216;once in a lifetime&#8217; and
head home. The day would hardly get any
better.
<!--l. 694--><p class="noindent" >He cruised through the empty streets of Lawndale
in his rust bucket of a car and hoped that nobody
at home would witness his return and the state he
was in. &#8216;Some chick about jumped me and we had
a corybantic make-out-session until some guys
showed up to take her home.&#8217; Yeah, right. None
would believe his story, and assume that he had a
run-in with just the other guys. His curfew would
be so tight that he would have to hurry to get
back from school in time &#8211; even if it was just to
protect him.

<!--l. 704--><p class="noindent" >Jane and Trent rode home in his car. After several
minutes of silence, Trent looked over at his sister
who still had a very happy smile on her face. She
had no idea how happy Trent had been when shejoined him to go home on her own accord.
 Trent tried not to interfere with her private life
 - or love life - but, damn, she was his little
 sister.
 <!--l. 710--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Janey, what was that about?&#8221;
 <!--l. 712--><p class="noindent" >Jane came out of her daydream and noted the
 peeved tone in Trent&#8217;s voice.
 <!--l. 714--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Geez, Trent, let me have some fun of my own.&#8221;
 <!--l. 716--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Janey, you acted like a bitch in heat.&#8221;
 <!--l. 718--><p class="noindent" >Jane got seriously defensive.
 <!--l. 722--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hey, I&#8217;ve got needs too! A girl takes the initiative
 once and all you guys say &#8216;look at that slut!&#8217;. This
 is not the 50s, Trent! God, I thought you were
 more open minded!&#8221;
 <!--l. 724--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You weren&#8217;t in control.&#8221;
 <!--l. 727--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;For sure I was in control, Trent! He would&#8217;ve
 done my every bidding. You were there!&#8221;
 <!--l. 729--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Were you in control of yourself?&#8221;
 <!--l. 731--><p class="noindent" >From the ensuing silence Trent infered that he
 was spot-on.
 <!--l. 733--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Again: Janey, what was that about?&#8221;
 <!--l. 735--><p class="noindent" >Jane didn&#8217;t answer right away. Trent saw that she
 needed some time to think.
 <!--l. 737--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;It was fun. I really really liked it.&#8221;
 <br class="newline" />Jane&#8217;s meek voice told Trent that his comment
 had hit home. He did not press on, and they
 arrived at the Lane&#8217;s home before another word
 was spoken. In the kitchen, grabbing another
 soda, he approached his sister again to placate her
 a little.
 <!--l. 743--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Jane, it was fun, and it was safe. So everything is
 fine.&#8221;
 <!--l. 745--><p class="noindent" >He had to admit that his big-brother-instinct told
 him to lock Jane in her room until further notice
 and go back and clobber the guy painstakingly. But
 his reason told him that this would be completely
 pointless. And would require additional effort.
 Jane&#8217;s state bothered Trent more than her
 escapades. She was not all right, and obviously
 prone to erratic behaviour. And unless she got
 her peace of mind back, that was unlikely to
 change.
 <!--l. 752--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Want your beer, Janey?&#8221;
 <!--l. 755--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Thanks Trent, but I think I&#8217;ll hit the hay right
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
away. &#8216;Sleep on it&#8217;, sounds familiar?&#8221;
