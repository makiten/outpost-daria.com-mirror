 <h3 class="sectionHead"><a

 <!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" ><a 
 id="txt_rel22"></a>
 <!--l. 19--><p class="noindent" >On late Sunday morning Jake went out to finish
 setting up the things he had purchased the day
 before in his new office rooms. Daria took it easy
 as well and was reading the Sunday paper at the
 kitchen table while Quinn was lazing in front of
 the TV watching some cartoons. Finally, Quinn
 became awake enough to realize that she was not
 really in the target age bracket. She shut down
 the TV, had a shower upstairs and retreated to
 her room.
 <!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >A little before noon, Daria decided to conclude
 her inspection of the cabling without her father
 and make a visit to the attic. Locating and
 extending the fold-down ladder at the end of the
 hallway in front of her room, she began to venture
 to unknown territories.
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
<!--l. 31--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>*****</h4>
<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" >A switch on top of the fold down ladder illuminated
the crawlspace through a dim light bulb hanging
by its cable from the top rafter. Little light came
through the small windows that hadn&#8217;t been
cleaned in centuries. Daria smelled the dust on
the bulb burn, as it was exposed to heat for the
first time after a very long while. Without her
flashlight, Daria would just have been able to
make out the rafters and avoid hitting her head,
but searching for defective cabling would have
been out of question.
<br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Darn. Let&#8217;s hope my eyesight is good enough for</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">unlimited night driving.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 43--><p class="noindent" >The crawlspace was cramped and dusty, but did
not contain any dead rats or similar unpleasant
surprises. Any movements had to be done in a
crouched position. There was indeed a wall with
a four by three foot door splitting the level
into about halves. Daria immediately went
over to open the door and inspect the other
side.
<!--l. 49--><p class="noindent" >The half over the master bedroom was as unexciting
as the other, so Daria closed the door and had a
look at the cables running loose on the attic floor.
The problem with the phone line to her room was
located fast. The walls to her room had been
strengthened with additional beams, likely when
the padding had been put in place. The phone
line had simply been cut off, once its old path had
became obstructed, since the new occupant of the
room had not been even allowed to have a
phone.
<!--l. 57--><p class="noindent" >Fixing the phone line would require little more
than some ten feet of new cable and reconnecting
the socket to the existing line to the splitter.
The cable TV line was uninterrupted, though.
After all, the shut-in&#8217;s TV was still mounted in
the corner of Daria&#8217;s room. So that problem
was caused by something else in a different     place.
 <!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Daria?&#8221; came her sister&#8217;s voice from the open
 trap door, interrupting Daria&#8217;s musings. She
 walked over, looked down and found her sister
 standing at the bottom of the ladder.
 <!--l. 67--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;There&#8217;re no rats up there, are there? There were
 noises...&#8221; Quinn asked meekly once she spotted
 her sister.
 <!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No, just me. Looking to fix my phone and
 cable.&#8221;
 <!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You&#8217;re sure?&#8221;
 <!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Haven&#8217;t seen any rats or rat droppings. So I&#8217;m
 pretty sure.&#8221;
 <br class="newline" />Daria shrugged and Quinn sighed. &#8220;What a
 relief.&#8221;
 <!--l. 77--><p class="noindent" >Daria descended the ladder and watched her sister
 return to her room.
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Sometimes you&#8217;re so childish.</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" >In her room she removed the phone socket and
 cut off the cable. Cutting off another two inches
 would give her a template to shop after.
 <!--l. 83--><p class="noindent" >
 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 85--><p class="noindent" >Quinn found her father, who had returned in the
 meantime, at the kitchen counter when she
 went down to pick up some ice water from
 the fridge. Several magazines were spread out
 open and she spotted even the well-worn Ikea
 catalogue that had been used to shop for small
 stuff.
 <!--l. 90--><p class="noindent" >Her father was engrossed in whatever he was
 doing and hardly acknowledged Quinn&#8217;s presence,
 so she addressed him once she had filled her glass
 of water.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Dad, what are you looking at?&#8221;
 <!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hello princess. Ah, just some pictures.&#8221;
 <!--l. 97--><p class="noindent" >Walking over, Quinn noticed that all the
 magazines were on interior design, or furniture
 catalogues.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;But Dad, we already bought all the furniture the
 new house needed. And we all agreed on not
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
shopping at Ikea. Even Daria did.&#8221;
<!--l. 103--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;That&#8217;s right, princess, but this is for work. One
of Daddy&#8217;s first contracts is setting up an office.
I&#8217;m just browsing for ideas.&#8221;
<br class="newline" />
<!--l. 105--><p class="noindent" >Jake flipped a page in one magazine, stared
at the office setting depicted, looked around,
picked up another magazine, and frantically
searched for something in it. After he found
the page he had in mind, he compared the
two.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;I knew it. The same furniture, but a third
cheaper.&#8221;
<!--l. 111--><p class="noindent" >Quinn looked around her father at the two
pictures.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;And I can tell you why. They got a cheap interior
designer and a crappy photographer as well. The
lamp&#8217;s colors soooo clash with the picture on the
wall. And the lighting looks crappy - just like in a
real office.&#8221;
<!--l. 116--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Still the furniture is a third cheaper, and that&#8217;s
what I&#8217;m buying.&#8221;
<br class="newline" />Pointing at the figures, Jake turned towards his
younger daughter, who spoke up again.
<!--l. 120--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Maybe I can give you some hints...</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;If they just didn&#8217;t use neon lights all over. Yuk.
Or at least use some drapes to add some color to
the indirect light, the whole setting wouldn&#8217;t
come out so...so sterile.&#8221;
<!--l. 126--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re right, but it&#8217;s money talking,
princess. Wait some years, and you&#8217;ll understand
that as well.&#8221;
<!--l. 128--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">I understand money quite well; I&#8217;m not five</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">anymore, dad.</span>&#187;
<br class="newline" />&#8220;But it&#8217;d take only a little money to fix those
things, and it&#8217;d really add to the office&#8217;s appeal.
Something dark violet maybe.&#8221;
<!--l. 132--><p class="noindent" >Jake put his hand on Quinn&#8217;s shoulder.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Look, Quinn, there are a lot more influences that
one needs to factor in here, and it takes a lot of
experience to know what the customers will find
appealing in the end. Finding those out is what
Daddy has learned, and it&#8217;s hard work. Some gut
feeling is a good start, but you always need to  find reasons why it&#8217;s a good idea to begin with.
 But don&#8217;t bother with that right now, learning
 that is something you&#8217;ll do when you grow
 up.&#8221;
 <!--l. 141--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Did you listen a tiny bit to what I said? &#8216;Grow</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">up&#8217;. How much more?! The doctors say I&#8217;m about</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">seventeen, body wise!</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Yes daddy.&#8221;
 <!--l. 144--><p class="noindent" >Her ice water now nearly at room temperature,
 Quinn returned to her room. She didn&#8217;t hear him
 mutter to himself &#8220;Enjoy your youth; it&#8217;s much
 much too short.&#8221;
 <!--l. 148--><p class="noindent" >
 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 150--><p class="noindent" >Once Daria noticed that her father was back, she
 told him about her findings concerning the phone
 lines. He was more than happy that one of the
 problems was more or less solved.
 <!--l. 154--><p class="noindent" >Later that afternoon, Daria and her father set
 out again to get some phone cable. Daria was
 happy to get some more driving done, and
 convinced her father to stop at the local army
 surplus store to get herself a proper winter
 jacket. Being able to shop men&#8217;s size once had
 its advantage. The Norwegian dawn jacket in
 dark-green-gray-white speckled snow camo set her
 Montana cabin fund back just a little, but its
 warmth would more than make make up for the
 money during the next years. That was real bang
 per buck.
 <!--l. 162--><p class="noindent" >Her father told her about the improvements to
 the office he had made in the morning. Some
 furniture beyond a desk and some chairs, some
 prints, and some accessories had changed its
 look from an interrogation room to a place
 where one could enjoy working. In a month, the
 creative chaos her father preferred would taken
 over, and the place would look really lived
 in.
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
<!--l. 168--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-6000"></a>*****</h4>
<!--l. 170--><p class="noindent" >Quinn was taking a break from reading and was
staring at the canopy of her bed while listening to
some music from her radio when the phone rang.
Not expecting any calls, Quinn ignored it. But, as
it rang the fourth time, Quinn knew that her
mother was either too busy to pick it up or
already on a call on her cell phone, so she finally
picked it up herself.

class="ecti-1095">Ah, ahm, could I speak to Quinn, please?</span>&#8221; a
female voice asked. It had a familiar ring to it,
yet Quinn could not place it, hence she was
careful.
<!--l. 181--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Maybe. Who&#8217;s this?&#8221; Quinn said, a little more
brusque than intended.
<!--l. 190--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;<span

<span

<span

<span

<span

<span 
class="ecti-1095">can call me back, but then she likely does not</span>
<span

<span 
class="ecti-1095">to get a pen and paper right now so maybe</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">you...</span>&#8221; Stacy spouted like a tommy gun until
Quinn&#8217;s
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Stacy! Breathe!&#8221;
<br class="newline" />interrupted her for good. Quinn wished she had
recognized her voice a little earlier.
<!--l. 196--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;<span 
class="ecti-1095">*Eeeep*!</span>&#8221;
<!--l. 198--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;It&#8217;s me, Quinn, Stacy.&#8221;
<!--l. 200--><p class="noindent" >Quinn heard her take several deep breaths, and
their slowing rhythm told her that Stacy was
slowly calming down. Quinn was pleasantly
surprised by the call, but something felt wrong.
<!--l. 204--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Hi Quinn.</span>&#8221;
<!--l. 207--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Nice talking to you Stacy. How did you get our
number? I haven&#8217;t given it to you.&#8221;
<!--l. 210--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;<span

class="ecti-1095">inLawndale. I hope you don&#8217;t mind.</span>&#8221; was the
 meek answer.
 <!--l. 212--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Stacy, we moved here a week ago. We&#8217;re not in
 the directory.&#8221;
 <!--l. 215--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;<span 
class="ecti-1095">On the computer. Online. There you are already,</span>
 <span

 <!--l. 217--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Oh, yes, there&#8217;s that.&#8221; Computers were not
 among Quinn&#8217;s everyday tools. Stacy did not pick
 up the conversation, so Quinn went on.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;So, why are you calling?&#8221;
 <!--l. 221--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;<span 
class="ecti-1095">I just wanted to talk to you. You&#8217;re busy?</span>&#8221;
 <!--l. 224--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No. I&#8217;m catching up on the reading list. And
 happy for any excuse to take a break.&#8221;
 <!--l. 227--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Yeah, you&#8217;ve moved in from cross-state. So what</span>
 <span 
class="ecti-1095">are you&#8217;re reading? I really liked...</span>&#8221;
 <!--l. 229--><p class="noindent" >Tying up the phone line for hours was a reflex for
 (almost) every teenage girl and Quinn was more
 than happy to succumb to that temptation.
 <!--l. 232--><p class="noindent" >

 <!--l. 235--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Dad, I&#8217;ll take care of the phone line immediately.
 That way I&#8217;ll at least be able to connect my old
 modem.&#8221; Daria said as they arrived back home
 from the short shopping trip.
 <!--l. 238--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Sure, kiddo. Need my help?&#8221;
 <!--l. 240--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Kiddo my ass.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Not for the phone line, dad, but we&#8217;ll have to do
 something about the TV line as well. Like call an
 expert.&#8221;
 <!--l. 244--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Well, ok. But let me have a look at it.&#8221;
 <!--l. 246--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;OK, I&#8217;ll call you.&#8221;
 <!--l. 248--><p class="noindent" >After collecting the tools and some luster terminals
 from the garage, her flashlight and the spool of
 new cable from her room, Daria climbed into the
 crawlspace again. She called for her father down
 the trap door.
 <!--l. 252--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;<span 
class="ecbx-1095">DAD!</span>&#8221;
 <!--l. 254--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;On my way!&#8221; said Jake and soon after he
 ascended the fold-down ladder to the attic &#8211;
 and promptly hit his head on one of the low
 rafters.
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
<!--l. 257--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;<span 
class="ecbx-1095">Gah! </span>My head! Dammit! This place is cramped.&#8221;
<!--l. 259--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Tell me about it, dad.&#8221;
<!--l. 261--><p class="noindent" >Since Daria was about an inch taller than he was,
he didn&#8217;t have to. Once he got his bearings
back, he took a quick look at the unknown
territory.
<!--l. 264--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You know what&#8217;s behind that door?&#8221;
<!--l. 266--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Same as here. Beside dust bunnies and dead flies:
nothing.&#8221;
<!--l. 268--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Seems dry up here. We can use this as storage
space.&#8221;
<!--l. 271--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yes. But things likely get baked up here during
the summer months. Look over here, dad.&#8221;
<!--l. 273--><p class="noindent" >Using her flashlight to point at the appropriate
places, Daria told her father about her findings.
<!--l. 279--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;They installed additional 2-by-4s to reinforce the
room&#8217;s walls, likely when they converted it into
the padded cell. See those loose ends of cable?
That&#8217;s the phone line, it wasn&#8217;t long enough to go
around the new beams, so the just cut it. No idea
about the TV, though.&#8221;
<!--l. 281--><p class="noindent" >Jake got the flashlight from Daria and carefully
moved towards her room inspecting all visible
cables and pipes.
<!--l. 285--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Looks like the antenna cable was reinstalled
when the room was remodelled. Nothing visibly
wrong with that.&#8221;
<!--l. 287--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Told you I didn&#8217;t see a thing. That needs to be
looked at again.&#8221;
<!--l. 289--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;ll see what we can do, Daria. Let&#8217;s fix that
phone line!&#8221;
<!--l. 293--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hm, dad, it&#8217;s too cramped up here to do that
together without constantly blocking each other.
And somebody needs to pull the cable to my
room, so why don&#8217;t you go down there.&#8221;
<!--l. 295--><p class="noindent" >Daria looked at her father who pondered her
words.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Pull the cable?&#8221;
<!--l. 300--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;It needs to go through the wall&#8217;s hollow, dad. I
just fix the new cable to the old and you pull the
old cable out of the wall in my room. Et voila,
we&#8217;re done.&#8221;
<!--l. 302--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Oh, yes. Sure!&#8221; said Jake as he went down to
Daria&#8217;s room.                                <!--l. 304--><p class="noindent" >
 <h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-8000"></a>*****</h4>
 <!--l. 306--><p class="noindent" >The whole process didn&#8217;t take much time. Together,
 they put the new cable quickly into place, and
 Daria connected the cable to the socket in
 her room. Before connecting the cables, Daria
 made sure everybody knew that the phone
 could act up and no calls were currently being
 made.
 <!--l. 311--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;ll use my cell phone&#8221; was her mother&#8217;s answer,
 and Daria went to notify her sister next.
 <!--l. 314--><p class="noindent" >

 <!--l. 318--><p class="noindent" >Quinn was still on the phone when somebody
 knocked at her door.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;...and it&#8217;s just facade? That&#8217;s ridiculous. Hold a
 moment, someone wants to see me.&#8221;
 <br class="newline" />Quinn covered the receiver and invited her guest
 with a brief &#8220;Yes&#8221; without getting up from her
 bed.
 <!--l. 324--><p class="noindent" >Her sister entered, took in the scene, and pointed
 at the telephone.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;I&#8217;m fixing my line, and that&#8217;s gonna interrupt
 your call.&#8221;
 <!--l. 327--><p class="noindent" >Quinn made pleading eyes at Daria, so her sister
 would not make her interrupt the phone call
 immediately.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Just a moment. Please.&#8221;
 <!--l. 331--><p class="noindent" >Daria nodded at her indicating that she gave her
 some more time, but a gesture told Quinn to
 hurry up. Once Daria had left her room, Quinn
 resumed the conversation.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Stacy, that was my sister, I&#8217;m going to have to
 end the call soon.&#8221;
 <!--l. 336--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Oh. Your sister.</span>&#8221; Stacy&#8217;s voice sounded unhappy.
 <!--l. 338--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Yes, she&#8217;s fiddling with the broken phone line to
 her room.&#8221;
 <!--l. 340--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;<span 
class="ecti-1095">She&#8217;s gone, now?</span>&#8221;
 <!--l. 342--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">What was that about?</span>&#187;
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Yeah, she&#8217;s gone downstairs and waiting for us to
finish. But I guess it&#8217;s just the &#8216;good byes&#8217;
that are left. We meet at school tomorrow,
anyway.&#8221;
<!--l. 346--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;<span

<span 
class="ecti-1095">before lunch.</span>&#8221;

At least during the practical parts.&#8221;
<br class="newline" />&#171;<span

<span

<!--l. 353--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;<span 
class="ecti-1095">We&#8217;ll talk there, Quinn. Bye then!</span>&#8221;
<!--l. 355--><p class="noindent" >Quinn knew it was now - or not for a long time.
&#8220;Stacy, hold a sec. I...&#8221;
<br class="newline" />Quinn&#8217;s voice suddenly lacked her usual
self-assuredness.
<!--l. 359--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Hmm?</span>&#8221;
<!--l. 363--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Stacy, I&#8217;m really glad you&#8217;ve called me. I ... it&#8217;s
not like I have that many people to talk to. Right
now, after the move. If you&#8217;d give me your
number...&#8221;
<br class="newline" />Quinn walked over to her desk where her note
book was laying.
<!--l. 366--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Sure, Quinn. Got pen and paper?</span>&#8221;
<!--l. 368--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Right here.&#8221;
<br class="newline" />Quinn was relieved. Things were on the way back
to normal.
<!--l. 371--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-10000"></a>*****</h4>
<!--l. 373--><p class="noindent" >Daria hadn&#8217;t finished the soda she had retrieved
from the fridge when Quinn came downstairs and
told her that she had cleared the phone.
<!--l. 376--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Thanks. I&#8217;ll try to make this quick.&#8221;
<!--l. 378--><p class="noindent" >Daria immediately went to the attic and connected
the cables with the luster terminals. Once she
didn&#8217;t pay enough attention and shortened two
wires, causing all phones in the house to emit an
irritated ring, but beside that there were no ill
side effects. All phones were working afterwards,
and her own phone finally produced the dial tone.
With the receiver at her ear listening to the dial
tone, Daria noted that something was still     missing:
 <br class="newline" />Someone to make a call to.

 <!--l. 389--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Daria, are you done cleaning the peas?&#8221; Jake
 asked while stirring the large stewpot that sat
 on the cooker. Daria, who was busy peeling
 potatoes looked shortly over her shoulder at her
 father.
 <!--l. 393--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No Dad, I haven&#8217;t even started.&#8221;
 <!--l. 396--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Damnit, Daria, we need to add them now to
 the stew so everything is cooked at the same
 time.&#8221;
 <!--l. 398--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No Dad, the potatoes need to go in first, they
 take longer to cook.&#8221;
 <!--l. 400--><p class="noindent" >Done with the peeling, Daria started to chop the
 potatoes to bite size.
 <!--l. 403--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;m doing the cooking today and you&#8217;re just
 helping. It&#8217;s my recipe, and that says the peas
 need to go in now!&#8221;
 <!--l. 405--><p class="noindent" >Jake left the cooker and focussed his attention
 solely on his daughter.
 <!--l. 409--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You may be cooking, it may be your recipe, and
 sticking to it will turn the peas in a lovely gooey
 mess without the tiniest amount of remaining
 bite.&#8221;
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">Dad, the basics!</span>&#187;
 <!--l. 412--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;My recipe says they need to go in now.&#8221;
 <!--l. 414--><p class="noindent" >Daria put the knife down and looked again at her
 father, who had his arms akimbo and glared at
 her.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;I&#8217;d really like to see that!&#8221;
 <!--l. 420--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;You can&#8217;t because I have it memorized! A decent
 cook doesn&#8217;t need a written recipe. Reading
 instructions breaks your concentration. It will
 take a while for you to understand that.&#8221;
 <!--l. 422--><p class="noindent" >&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">My memorized recipe says so. Sure.</span>&#187;
 <br class="newline" />Daria turned around and folded her arms.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;A decent cook <span 
class="ecbx-1095">knows </span>that potatoes take
 longer than peas and deduce that the recipe is
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
wrong.&#8221;
<!--l. 427--><p class="noindent" >Jake took a half-step towards Daria.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;Are you saying that I&#8217;m not a decent cook?!&#8221;
<!--l. 430--><p class="noindent" >Daria saw her father&#8217;s temper rising, and tried

recipes.&#8221;
<!--l. 434--><p class="noindent" >Jake had not even listened to her answer and
raised his voice well above domestic level.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;NO ONE SAYS I&#8217;M A BAD COOK!&#8221;
<!--l. 438--><p class="noindent" >Daria felt her own temper rising. Her willpower
would not hold much longer. She matched her
level to her father&#8217;s to keep the chance to get
through to him.

 mother sitting in the love seat in front of her
 numerous files. However, she wasn&#8217;t working, but
 looking in at the partially opened door leading to
 the kitchen. Through that door Daria&#8217;s and
 Jake&#8217;s voices didn&#8217;t drift, but washed into the

 <br class="newline" />&#8220;They are at it once again?&#8221;
 <!--l. 479--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Hear for yourself.&#8221;
 <br class="newline" />Helen made a gesture towards the kitchen,
 frustration clearly in her voice. These rants made
 her always uncomfortable. She had tried many
 times to calm Daria and Jake down, but her
 efforts had usually made things worse - she had
 been sucked into the matter. And while Daria
 and Jake did take no real offence during these
 proceedings, Helen did. And Daria had some
 prime choice nasty comments for everything if she
 wasn&#8217;t keeping her tongue in check. The result
 had been that Helen was angry beyond belief at
 both of them while they were already best friends
 again.
 <!--l. 489--><p class="noindent" >Trying even the simplest physical gesture was out
 of question for Helen. Being the smallest &#8211; and

THING? TRY BEING ME!&#8221;
<!--l. 501--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Mom, what are they going on about? Cooking?&#8221;
<br class="newline" />Quinn asked her mother to divert her, sensing her
discomfort. Their voices were loud enough
to understand every single word - out in the
backyard with all doors closed. Helen just nodded.
<!--l. 506--><p class="noindent" >Quinn hoped that the new house had enough
space around it that the neighbours wouldn&#8217;t
notice. Or at least ignore it and not call the
police, as had happened twice back in Highland.
That was the worst outcome of their shout-outs.
Otherwise, they would stop eventually, wonder
what they had been yelling about, shrug, and go
on with whatever they had been doing before, not
caring what effects the fallout of their ranting had
on the people around them. For example scaring
her mother.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;I guess they&#8217;ll be done any minute.&#8221;
<!--l. 515--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I really hope.&#8221;
<!--l. 517--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;I&#8217;ll have a look. Maybe I can calm them a
little.&#8221;
<!--l. 519--><p class="noindent" >Helen looked at her daughter, wondering why
she simply wouldn&#8217;t stay clear of a ranting
Daria. Or Daria and Jake ranting at each other.
Jake on his own was easily distracted, but
with the two of them at it, the best option
was to wait until they calmed down on their
own.
<br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">But there&#8217;s no way to concentrate on the files</span>

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a

<!--l. 528--><p class="noindent" >Quinn entered the kitchen and saw her sister and
her father standing inches apart, their faces
red, shouting at each other. Just shouting,
there was no communication involved in the
process.
<!--l. 532--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;...ALL YOUR CARING WON&#8217;T GIVE YOU ACLUE IF YOU DON&#8217;T USE YOUR BRAIN!&#8221;
 <!--l. 534--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;...BUT NO, I HAD TO DO IT <span 
class="ecbx-1095">HIS </span>WAY!&#8221;
 <!--l. 536--><p class="noindent" >Quinn walked towards the fridge with the intention
 to get herself a soda, and purposely chose a path
 that would require Daria and her father to step
 aside to let her pass. But she didn&#8217;t make it that
 far.
 <!--l. 540--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;WHO CARES ABOUT... what&#8217;s that smell,
 dad?&#8221;
 <!--l. 542--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;DO NOT TRY TO DISTRA...yeah, that smells
 really funny...GAH! THE STEW!&#8221;
 <!--l. 544--><p class="noindent" >Jake immediately returned to the stewpot that
 still sat on the cooker. Not being stirred during
 their rant, it had started to burn. He was quick
 enough to stop himself from stirring the stew
 now.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;Daria, get another pot!&#8221;
 <!--l. 549--><p class="noindent" >Jake&#8217;s command was unnecessary, as Daria was
 already busy looking for another pot big enough
 to hold the stew; at least, the uncontaminated
 remains.
 <!--l. 552--><p class="noindent" >Quinn tried not to smirk too much while she got
 herself the soda.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;You think you&#8217;ll be able to save it, or should I
 order something?&#8221;
 <!--l. 555--><p class="noindent" >Daria and Jake were busy transferring the top
 portion of the stew into the second pot. Daria
 sampled a little.
 <br class="newline" />&#8220;No, I think this&#8217;ll be ok for dinner; stop Dad, we
 won&#8217;t get a complete second meal out of it
 anyway.&#8221;
 <br class="newline" />There was a slight hint of burned taste, but it was
 faint and about half of the ingredients were still to
 be added.
 <!--l. 562--><p class="noindent" >Quinn looked at her sister. Her, she did believe.
 Her father&#8217;s definition of &#8216;edible&#8217; was too different
 from her own, though. She returned to the living
 room, and behind her Daria and Jake busied
 themselves with the dinner. She sat across from
 her mother, who still hadn&#8217;t returned to her
 files.
 <!--l. 567--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;They&#8217;re done. Saved by the stew.&#8221;
 <!--l. 569--><p class="noindent" >This was good news for Helen, and her face spoke
 volumes. She sniffed and noticed the faint burnt
                                                                                      

                                                                                      
odor that emerged from the kitchen.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;And saved from the stew?&#8221;
<!--l. 574--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;No, they could salvage enough for dinner. I
already offered to order out.&#8221;
<!--l. 576--><p class="noindent" >Helen nodded, and had a look at the table full of
the files.
<br class="newline" />&#8220;I wish they wouldn&#8217;t do that.&#8221;
<!--l. 580--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Me neither, but it&#8217;s just what they do. And as
long as they limit it to the house...&#8221;
<!--l. 582--><p class="noindent" >Quinn took another sip from her soda giving her
mother some time to think about her argument.
<!--l. 585--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;There&#8217;s that.&#8221;
<!--l. 587--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;And it doesn&#8217;t happen out of the blue by a
loooong way.&#8221;
<!--l. 590--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;There&#8217;s that as well. And luckily Jake rants far
less often on his own since they started doing
that.&#8221;
<!--l. 592--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;Must be a group activity.&#8221; Quinn shrugged.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-14000"></a>*****</h4>
<!--l. 598--><p class="noindent" >Jane looked at the two sketches of &#8216;Darius&#8217; and
&#8216;Daria&#8217; she had drawn at the beginning of the
week, and was finally able to appreciate the
humor of the whole situation.
<br class="newline" />&#171;<span 
class="ecti-1095">I bet some higher entities are pointing their</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">fingers, tentacles, or whatever at me and laughing</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1095">themselves silly.</span>&#187;
<!--l. 604--><p class="noindent" >Trent had not dared to wake her up before nine
o&#8217;clock, but that was just because &#8216;daring&#8217;
required being awake. Jane had gotten up around
eleven, caffeinated herself, and used the pleasant
autumn weather for a breakfast run. Getting a
drink from the fridge showed her that there
was still food left from Monday&#8217;s trip to Food
Lord. Trent had somehow managed to keep
the band away from the kitchen. After her
shower, Jane treated herself to a nice brunch
consisting of pop-tarts, cup ramen, and some
peanuts.
<!--l. 612--><p class="noindent" >Now Jane, after she had grudgingly brought her
homework to the &#8216;can-barely-get-away-with-it&#8217;  level, browsed through her work-in-progress art
 and had come across the sketches. She really
 had to get Daria to model for her, and after
 some days had passed (and two PE classes that
 had left nothing to imagination) Jane was
 sure she would be able to paint her without
 going insane. Daria&#8217;s body was unusual, she&#8217;d
 be an unusual model, and Jane loved her art
 unusual.
 <!--l. 620--><p class="noindent" >Daria&#8217;s sister would be a more suitable model
 if Jane wanted the classical model qualities.
 However, Jane was not sure if she had what it
 takes to pose for a painted picture. Photography
 was likely more suited to capture her, but that
 wasn&#8217;t Jane&#8217;s medium. And somehow Jane had
 the hunch that the girl was already on her way to
 become a professional model. Her walk and
 posture did not seem natural, but rather schooled
 and honed.
 <!--l. 627--><p class="noindent" >The difference between the girls still puzzled Jane
 as much as their adult appearance did. Daria
 was chunky as her sister was dainty. There
 was no doubt about the outcome if sibling
 rivalry ever got physical between those two. Jane
 was even less than Daria&#8217;s sister, in size and
 weight. She shuddered at the possible things
 a malevolent Daria could do to her without
 breaking a sweat.
 <br class="newline" />&#171;<span

 <!--l. 647--><p class="noindent" >&#8220;It was very nice, the food was really good, the
 party pleasant and I met some really influential
 people.&#8221;

clear that he did not believe a single word.
