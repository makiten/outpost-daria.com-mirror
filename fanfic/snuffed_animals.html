<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Author's Note: This
story arose from a comment on the Daria Wiki, stating that an
alternate universe version of the episode Fire! had been a rare
occurrence.  I decided to see what difference one small change &ndash;
namely a fire extinguisher &ndash; would make to the events of both
Fire! and Dye! Dye! My Darling.

One</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"'Of <I>course</I>
it's decaf!' Damn sadistic waiter. I should have stiffed him
when I had the chance!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake Morgendorffer
searched through the refrigerator for the milk carton while grumbling
about his insomnia to nobody in particular. He found the carton near
the back of the fridge and took it over to the stove. Milk had really
helped him relax lately, tryptophane or not, and warm milk was even
more effective. He got the pot onto the stove, but knocked over the
milk carton as he turned on the gas burner. "Damn milk!"
he swore at the spilled container. He reached for the paper towels,
which seemed to catch on the holder. The towels stretched over the
range top, and when Jake replanted his foot for leverage, he stepped
right into the spilled milk. This caused him to slip, his chin
slamming into the counter. "Damn it! Where does Helen hide the
mop?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Jake went to a
nearby closet to find the mop, he failed to notice the paper towels,
forgotten in the chaos, which had fallen onto the open flame of the
burner. Jake sniffed the air. "Funny, I could swear I smell
smoke." He turned back to the stove, and saw that the stove and
counter were covered in flames. "Yaaaaah! Fire! Fire!" he
yelled as he grabbed the red cylinder that Helen had insisted on
buying after Jake's last attempt at his Five-Alarm Chili
recipe.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upstairs, Helen
Morgendorffer was semi-conscious, yet talking on her cell phone with
her boss, Eric Schrecter. "No, Eric, it's only 1:00 a.m. Of
<I>course</I> you didn't wake me." Jake's voice came up
from downstairs, snapping Helen into full consciousness. "Oh,
my God, Eric, the house is on fire! I'll have to call you back."
Helen paused to hear what her boss responded with. "No, I <I>don't
</I>know when!" Another short pause, and then, "No, you
<I>can't </I>hold!" She hung up the phone and put her
boss to the back of her mind. "Gotta get Daria and Quinn out of
the house."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn, who'd
overheard the commotion because she had been on the house phone with
her friend, Sandi Griffin, ran around the room panicking. "Damn
it, the house is on fire!" Quinn looked into the mirror, and
gasped, realizing she was in her pajamas, her hair was frizzed out,
and she wasn't wearing any makeup. "Sandi, this is
terrible! I don't even have time to pack, and I can't run out of the
house looking like this!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen ran into the room
and grabbed Quinn. "Quinn! Come on!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn tried to protest,
but was only able to say "But..." before being
pushed out of her bedroom door.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen grabbed the
cordless phone Quinn had been talking on. "Sandi? She'll have
to call you back." She paused once again to hear what Sandi had
to say. "No, I <I>don't </I>know when!" She hung up
the phone and raced across the hall to get her other daughter, Daria,
since Jake hadn't come up for her. "Daria, wake up!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria, wearing her
usual nightshirt and shorts, grabbed her glasses and sat up in bed.
"Mmm, but it's so relaxing to hear calming voices all
around me."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen wasted no time
grabbing Daria by the hand. "Daria, we have no time for your
sarcasm now. Get moving!" She pulled Daria out of bed and out
the door. "But thank you for not being on the phone," she
muttered under her breath, making Daria smile a little.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn was at the foot
of the stairs as Helen and Daria came down, which made Helen ask,
"What are you doing? Move!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake called from the
kitchen, "Fire's out, dear! The extinguisher worked like
a charm!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen sighed in relief.
"Thank God. You girls should still get out in case it spread
further."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn groaned, "But
Mo-om!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen looked at her
daughter sternly. "Now, Quinn." She eased up as she
looked at her older daughter. "You too, Daria."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria looked at her
mother, her eyes somewhat less than half-open. "At least Dad
didn't try to burn the house down in February." She
folded her arms as she went out the front door.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen went to say
something, but Daria had already left. <I>You have a point, </I>she
thought, as she walked over to the kitchen. "Jake, are you sure
it's out?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake coughed, still
trying to clear the combined smoke and extinguisher exhaust that
partially clouded the air. "Yep; it flared back up a couple
times, but it's done now. I covered the burner too, and that
helped suffocate the flames."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen walked over to
her husband. "Thank God you're all right. What happened?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I was making
some hot milk, the damn milk spilled, I slipped trying to get paper
towels over to the spill, and when I went for a mop, the stove was on
fire."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen looked at Jake,
her concern replaced with anger. "Jake, leaving paper towels by
an open flame? What were you thinking?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake looked thoughtful,
trying to remember. "Well, I remember thinking, "Damn it,
damn waiter with his damn phony decaf." Then I was thinking, "I
need some damn milk..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen cut him off. "Oh,
never mind. I should know better than to ask what you were thinking."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A frown grew on Jake's
face. "What's that supposed to mean? Damn it, Helen, it
was an accident!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Well it was no
accident I bought that fire extinguisher. I'll have to get it
refilled on my way to work tomorrow."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Oh, so I don't
burn the house down tomorrow? When are you going to show some damn
faith in me?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen's voice was
practically a hiss by this point. "How about when you start
deserving some damn faith?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside, Daria and
Quinn stood at their sidewalk, able to hear their parents through the
windows Jake had opened to vent the kitchen. As the fight continued,
Quinn leaned against her sister, and Daria instinctively put her arm
on Quinn's shoulders. A fire truck pulled up, and a firefighter
got out. "Excuse me, but we got reports of smoke from this
address. Is the fire out?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn went to say
something, but the sound of her father's voice quieted her, so
Daria spoke. "It depends on which fire you're talking
about."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
Two</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The next day, an
insurance adjustor came over to inspect the damage. He was just
finishing as he spoke to the four of them in the dining room. "You're
pretty lucky. Having the fire extinguisher kept the damage to a
minimum." Helen smiled as she looked at Jake, whose face
drooped. "Still, it's a good thing the fire was put out
right away, or the extinguisher might not have been enough."
Jake now smiled, while Helen rolled her eyes. "Outside of
repainting the kitchen and replacement of the rangetop, you were
pretty much unscathed. We should be able to have painters in Monday
and a new rangetop by Wednesday. Until then, I recommend Mama Leone's
on Clements and 47<SUP>th</SUP>. They don't pay me to say that,
but in my line of work, 'Where can we get a good pizza?'
comes right after 'Will this raise my rates?'" The
man chuckled a bit at his own joke.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen, not laughing
with him, asked, "So, will this raise our rates?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I'm not in
charge of that, but I don't believe it will. Accidents happen;
that's why we're here."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn spoke next. "It's
almost too bad it wasn't worse. I wouldn't mind having to
spend a few days away in a luxury hotel or resort or something."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Actually, nice
might be pushing it. With your coverage, you'd probably have
enough for somewhere like the Dutchman Inn."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn looked at him
incredulously. "That place with the giant clog?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria spoke up. "Would
that be a room in the hotel or the clog itself?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The adjustor smiled. "I
think the going rates are about the same, and the clog might be a bit
bigger than the rooms. Anything else before I head out?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen put on her best
in-court smile. "No, thank you. I'm just happy we're
all alive, but not having to worry about restoring our house is very
comforting."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"All in a day's
work. Enjoy the rest of your day."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"So Dad almost
burned the house down, and then Mom tried to burn him down,"
Daria said into her phone a few hours later.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane Lane, on the other
end of the line, smiled. "At least Jake can still fight fire
with fire. Can you imagine Mr. O'Neill standing up to your
mother?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Yes, I see him
standing tall and proud, telling her how concerned he is about her
well-being. And then, Mom would show up." Daria paused. "Do
you mind if I come over tonight? My room still smells a bit like a
barbeque, and there's not a rack of ribs in sight."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Actually, I was
planning a little alone time with Tom tonight."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria's voice
sank. "Oh."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane, realizing she was
shutting Daria out, came back with "Say, if they're going
to be painting tomorrow, you should come over here. I know better
than most how dangerous paint fumes can be."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Hmm, on the one
hand, paint fumes could lead to brain damage. On the other hand, the
Fashion Club meeting scheduled for that day would make sense."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Both of those
hands sound like they're headed over here."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Definitely; the
first one could be a bit dangerous, but the other is just plain
scary."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
Three</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"How about
<I>Screecher II</I>? I heard those blood-sucking eyeballs look really
cool when they burst."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom looked across the
couch at his girlfriend, who had just made the suggestion. "Actually,
I'm kind of in the mood for a movie with a plot." <I>As opposed
to the last five you wanted to see</I>. "Hey, Daria left me a
message about a Fellini film festival."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Oh yeah?"
<I>Great, another European "Arthouse" movie, just the
kind of thing Daria loves. Wait. </I>"You gave Daria your
number?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"You did. So we
could go rescue her from 'mother/daughter bonding day'?"
<I>Damn it, Jane, stop jumping to conclusions!</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Right, right,
right." <I>Damn it, Jane, stop jumping to conclusions!</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom knew he had some
breathing room. "I guess she remembered the debate we got into
on Fellini's symbolism."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane smirked. "I
do, too; one of the best naps I ever had."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Here we go again.</I>
"Hey, the cinema can be more than bursting eyeballs."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"The <I>cinema</I>?"
<I>Pretentious, aren't we?</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Yes, the cinema; you
know, like the movies, except you have to think. </I>"Look, do
you want to see <I>La Dolce Vita</I>?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Like I want a poke
in the eye.</I> "I think I'll pass." <I>I bet Daria
would just love to take you instead.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Fine."
<I>What's going on lately? Every time we hang out, we end up
fighting, and Daria inevitably comes up. I might as well go out with
her if I'm going to put up with the insinuations.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane stole a sideways
glance at her boyfriend, still brooding over the discussion. <I>God,
you talk about her more than I do. I need to talk to her...but
definitely not right now.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From the TV, the
announcer said, "Is there really a secret underwater railroad
smuggling flounder to freedom? Get on board the sole train, tonight
on <I>Sick, Sad World</I>!" Jane and Tom would have found the
railroad reproduction somewhat lacking, had either been watching the
program before them.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
Four</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria stared at her
computer screen, as she had been doing for the last 15 minutes. <I>Damn,
still no spontaneously generated story ideas. Well, except that one,
but hearing what people are thinking has been done to death. Hmm,
what was it Mom said about that writing assignment O'Neill
gave? Something honest. How about boredom on a Sunday afternoon? No,
I already tried to write that one last week, and it went nowhere. I
guess that's fitting.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria stood up, and
started pacing in her room. <I>Maybe it's time for another stab
at figuring out what's eating Jane. Probably Tom, as usual.
</I>Daria stopped walking and shuddered. <I>Damn imagination; you
know that's not what I meant. </I>She continued. <I>It's
like ever since Tom's started to be a decent person, Jane's
become unreasonable. Just because we can get along now and have a few
conversations, it's not like he's going to jump off her
and onto me. </I>She stopped again. <I>Is he? No, can't be. Why
would he take an interest in me? I mean, sure, we're able to
have some good debates, but if he's going out with Jane, why...I
need to stop thinking about this. Maybe Mom, Dad or Quinn will bring
some measure of entertainment.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria inched open her
door and listened. From Quinn's room, she heard, "Of
course one meeting will be enough for faux tanning lotions. It's
not like we're going to need them 8 months out of the year.
This will free up more time to prepare for the blush evaluation the
week after this. Besides, we've already eliminated half of the
lotions from previous winters. Another 10 shouldn't take that
long with four of us." Daria decided that taking Jane up on her
offer of sanctuary was the right thing to do, paint fumes or not.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As she walked
downstairs, she heard her mother on her cell phone. "Of course,
Eric. Well, if they knew the money was counterfeit, why would they
have paid taxes on it? Did they really say 'We didn't
want to break the law' under oath? Oh, don't worry; I'll
make sure they have their stories straight before I leave tomorrow,
even if it takes all night." With that, Daria was certain she
wouldn't be missed tomorrow night.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria walked into the
kitchen where her father was trying to figure out the take-out Sushi
he'd ordered from Samurai a Go-Go, the more respectable
Japanese restaurant in town. "Hiya, kiddo! How's your
homework coming?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria grabbed a glass
and filled it with ice cubes. "I did my homework last night,
and since they didn't assign any today, I'm still done."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake, who was paying
more attention to his food than Daria, as per usual, replied, "Good
for you, Kiddo! Now, you take the piece of sushi, add a small amount
of this mint paste, cover with the red thing..." Daria
filled her glass with water as she watched her father put a pea-sized
ball of wasabi onto the slice of tuna and covered it with a leaf of
ginger, and lifted it to his mouth. She set her glass down on the
dining room table in front of Jake, just as he bit down on the piece.
"GAAAAAAH! Water! Water!" Jake grabbed Daria's
water cup, and first gulped down water, then tried balancing one of
the cubes on his tongue. "Whew, thanks kiddo!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Any time, Dad.
You know, wasabi's almost as strong as horseradish."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I knew that damn
waiter was giggling as I left. Mint paste my..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria interrupted with,
"Sushi's good for your heart, too."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Yeah!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria rolled her eyes
when she knew her father wasn't looking. "Hey Dad, since
Quinn's friends are having their usual meeting here, would it
be ok if I spent the evening at Jane's studying?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake thought it over.
"I guess that would be fair. You're going to miss out on
curry from that new Hello Delhi restaurant."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I should be able
to handle it. Just let me know how their food is." <I>Assuming
you survive it.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Sure thing,
kiddo. Hmm, maybe if I cut down the green stuff to half as much..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria walked away from
her father to get a new glass of water. <I>This sushi might even be
healthy enough to counteract the stress it causes. </I>Jake flailed
around as he realized he had once again used too much wasabi<I>. Nah.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom walked to the door
with Jane. "I'm glad we had the chance to make up."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane smiled. "Make
up or make out?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom smiled back. "Hey,
two great things that go great together. You want to get together
after school tomorrow?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane panicked a little
inside. "Actually, I was going to spend the night with Daria.
Her kitchen is getting repainted after that stove fire her dad
started."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom frowned at first.
"That's right. It's a good thing that didn't
get out of hand." Tom smiled again. "Hey, why don't
the three of us go out for pizza, my treat? Trent could come along
too if he's free."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Hmm, Trent
probably won't be back from tonight's practice by then;
especially since he hasn't left for it yet. I'll ask
Daria tomorrow and let you know if she's up for it. Bye hon."
She kissed him on the cheek and watched him go out to his car. <I>After
all, if you're both in front of me, then you can't do
anything behind my back.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom walked away
smiling. <I>All right! Jane's happy, and I get to spend time
with her and Daria tomorrow. Intelligent conversation and the chance
for some more making out before the night's over. Life's
pretty good.</I> He looked towards Jane, who put on a quick grin and
waved as he got in the car. <I>Or I'm a dead man.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Timothy O'Neill
looked over his classroom. "Now, as you mull over the title,
<U>The Red Badge of Courage</U>, who besides me hears the Cowardly
Lion in your head singing 'If I only had the noive?'"
He laughed at his own joke, then realized that he was the only one
reacting, and sighed.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Mr. O'Neill's
class, Daria and Jane walked out of the classroom together. Jane
spoke first. "Oh, Tom wanted to know if you were interested in
all three of us going out for pizza after school."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria shrugged. "Hey,
pizza's better than whatever Dad's getting for Indian
food, and you and Tom sure beat the Fashion Fiends for dinner
companions."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Hannibal Lecter
would beat the Fashion Fiends for dinner companions."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Replace beat
with eat, and I'm feeling better already."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane smiled. "That
too. Oh, by the way, uh, thanks for leaving that message on Tom's
machine about <I>La Dolce Vita</I>." <I>Thanks for another
pointless argument.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Hey, watching a
dead fish wash up on shore always puts me in a good mood."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"But you know;
you don't have to go to all the trouble of calling Tom. I'm always
happy to pass messages along."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>The hell?</I> "Sure,
I just..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane saw her art class,
just like she planned it. "Well, here's my classroom,
bye."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria put her hand on
Jane's shoulder. "Wait a minute; what are you trying to
say?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Damn it.</I> "Um,
that this is my classroom, and I have to go into it."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>You know what I
mean.</I> "Why do you have a problem with me calling Tom? You
gave me his number, remember?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I know; I know.
Look, it's not that I don't trust you."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria became more upset
at that. "Trust me? Trust me with what?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Hold on."
<I>Damn it, I don't want a scene.</I> "I trust you. I
just don't trust..." <I>Say it, Jane. Just say it.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Don't
trust what? My judgment? My hormones? My sister? What?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane finally blurted
out, "Tom."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria's jaw
dropped. "Oh."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane snorted. "Yeah,
'Oh'. We haven't been doing so well lately, and
when you two start debating and going on about all that stuff you
read, it makes me feel like I'm being left out of my own
relationship. As much as I know you're just having a
conversation, I feel like he's interviewing you for my
position."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria sighed. "Look,
I probably know less about what he's thinking than you do, but
I don't believe he's that interested in me. I can promise
you that I'm not trying to take him away from you."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I know. I just...I
just wish I could figure out what he wants. I'm not even sure
he knows what he wants."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Well, I know
what I want, and that's not to get detention for being late to
my next class. See ya." <I>Tom's not interested in me. I
don't want Tom to be interested in me. I'm not interested
in Tom. So why do I feel so guilty?</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Bye."
<I>You're my best friend. I believe you when you won't
steal my boyfriend. So why does it feel like you already have?</I>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen came into her
house through the front door. "Helloooo! The case wrapped early
today." she called out.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake, in the other
room, just home after getting dinner, called back, "Hi honey!
Kitchen's looking great!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen walked into the
kitchen. "Oh, my; this is wonderful. You could hardly tell you
almost...um, that anything happened."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake smiled, missing
Helen's intended statement. "Yep, and the crew even had
most of the paint fumes out before I got back with dinner!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen's smile
went away. "You left the painters here unsupervised?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake's smile also
went away. "I had the girls looking after them. I'd
already paid them, and the four of them were enough to keep them
honest."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen smiled as she
poured herself a cup of coffee. "Ah, that sounds much better."
She took a sip, then frowned. "What do you mean, 'the
four of them'?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Quinn and her
friends, remember? They're having one of their meetings, so I
had them hold it downstairs until the painters left."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I see. Why
didn't you get Daria to do it?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Oh, she asked
yesterday if she could spend the evening at Jane's."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen gulped the sip of
coffee that had just entered her mouth. "What? Damn it, Jake;
this was one of the few times we'd get to have dinner together,
and she just blows it off to spend more time with her friend. It's
like she doesn't even want to spend time with us!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"She'll be
all right, Helen. I promised I'd tell her how good the curry
is."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Jake, are you
listening to me? This isn't about the food; it's about
Daria not spending time with us!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake started to get
angry at that. "Oh, and you wouldn't understand someone
in this family not spending time with us!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"What's
that supposed to mean?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"What do you
think it's supposed to mean?


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As her parents'
voices rose, Quinn sat on the top stair, listening to her parents
argue again. She had left the meeting to get their steamed vegetables
and rice, and stopped when she heard her parents' voices. Their
arguments had gotten worse since the fire, and showed no signs of
improvement. Quinn buried her head in her hands.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy had walked out of
Quinn's room after Sandi suggested she check up on Quinn. She
had just said, "Quinn," when Jake's voice rang out
loud. Quinn looked back at Stacy with a tear in her eye. Stacy sat
down next to Quinn and put her arm around Quinn's shoulder, and
Quinn leaned onto Stacy for support.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom had just received
the change from the cashier at Pizza King. "I'll bring
the pizza to the table."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane held out her hand.
"Oh, no, I insist. You pay, I'll stay."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom smiled. "Ok,
thanks Janey."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom and Daria made
their way over to the booth. Daria sat on the far side and Tom on the
near side. Daria commented, "You seem to be in a good mood."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom shrugged. "I
guess so. Jane's happy with me, I'm hanging out with two
cool ladies instead of Dad's stuffy hangers-on, and I'm
about to sink my teeth into some Bacon-Tomato Overdrive Pizza. All in
all, it looks like a pretty good evening."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria looked over at
Jane. "You make it sound like Jane being happy with you isn't
a sure thing."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom sighed, the smile
on his face finally fading. "Well, lately it hasn't been.
It's like lately I can't help but suggest things she
doesn't like. I tried suggesting that Fellini Festival and she
practically bit my head off."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria smiled on the
inside, thinking of her conversation with Jane earlier. "Well,
if you had sold it as watching a dead fish washing up on shore, she
might have gone for it."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I'm
starting to realize that."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria let that pass at
first, but then caught something in the tone that didn't sound
right. "What do you mean?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Come on, Daria.
We both know Jane's not much for giving any movie that makes
you think a fair shake. Any time I try to bring up something on a
higher intellectual plane than Mario Bava, it's like I'm
talking to a brick wall."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"So what, you'd
rather have a brain for a girlfriend?" Daria tried not to let
it show that she had only realized what she had said after it had
been said.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom, for his part,
hadn't noticed the wording. "Well, it'd be nice to
have a conversation on a higher level than 'Did you see the
last episode of Sick Sad World? Wasn't that weird?'"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Come on, it's
not like Jane's stupid. So she's not the Nietzsche and
Ingmar Bergman type. It's not like she's going on about
her mascara database."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"It's not
what she doesn't know; it's that she won't even try
to get interested in what I have to say. When she puts down something
I care about, it's like she's saying that she doesn't
care about me. I just wish she had your taste so that we could have a
few decent conversations."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"As opposed to
the arguments we usually have?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom twitched at hearing
Jane behind him. He turned around, and saw his girlfriend behind him,
holding their pizza over his head.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria attempted to
break the tension by saying, "You know, even if he paid for the
pizza, I'd kind of like a chance at a slice before you dump it
on him."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane eyed Daria. "Oh,
I figure I could salvage a slice or two to throw at you." She
then set the pizza down on the table and sat down next to Tom. "I
couldn't do that to a pizza anyway. It never did anything to
hurt me."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom rolled his eyes.
"Jane, neither have..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane turned sharply to
her boyfriend. "'I just wish you were more like Daria.'
Do you realize what that sounds like?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom replied, "That's
not what I meant! It's just...when I'm with you, I
feel like I have to pretend that a lot of myself doesn't exist,
whether it's my interest in foreign films, or philosophy, or
just about anything my family does."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane frowned. "Oh,
so now <I>I'm</I> the one who doesn't want to talk about
your family? Excuse me, Mr.
Thanks-for-getting-me-out-of-that-stupid-banquet, but you're
the one who stopped bringing them up."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Because you
always made some sarcastic remark, no matter what they did. They buy
me a new set of clothes, and you tell me that I can't dress
myself. They pledge money for a charity ball, and you complain about
it being another High Society event. Would you prefer if they just
gave all their money away and lived in a shelter?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria spoke up. "Hey!"
Both Tom and Jane looked at Daria. "If you two are just going
to fight through dinner, then I might as well take my share to go."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane grimaced. "Sure,
run off like you don't have anything to do with this."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"What?" Tom
and Daria said in unison.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Oh, come on;
you're telling me you can't see that you're the one
he's going to pick up after he drops me?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom was starting to get
angry at that suggestion. "Whoa, whoa, I am not planning on
picking up anyone. Sure, I'm not overly optimistic on our
future, and sure, I'd ask out Daria if we weren't going
out, but I'm not just going to see her behind your back or
anything."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria scowled at Tom.
"Oh, so you would ask me out if you weren't going out
with Jane? Then you're just waiting for the breakup to become
official before you made moves on me?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom looked defensive.
"That's not what I said! I want this relationship with
Jane to work, but it doesn't seem to be working. If you were
just a cool person I knew, and didn't know who I'd dated
in the past, would you have an issue with me asking you out?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria was flustered.
"Well, I, no, but..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane took over. "Wait
a minute, what do you mean it doesn't seem to be working?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom looked at Jane. "Do
<I>you</I> think it's working?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane stopped, thought
for a moment, and sighed. "No, it's not. Damn it, so it's
over then?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom put his hand
tentatively on Jane's near shoulder. "I don't know.
I like you. I like being with you. We seem to have some pretty major
issues, but if you want to try to work them out, so do I."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane sighed. "And
if they don't work out, you'll start going out with
Daria?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom shrugged. "Maybe,
but that's not really up to me. I know how strange that would
make these pizza sessions."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria pitched in, "To
say nothing of the sleepover parties. Look, Tom, you need to realize
I'm in a tough position."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom replied, "I
know. Going out with your best friend's ex is a strange
concept."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria shot back, "Not
just that. If that was it, I'd say no and move on. On the other
hand, you're a decent and interesting person. I can see what
Jane sees in you. Combine that with my less-than-stellar dating
history and the temptation is something I can't just ignore."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane eyed her friend
warily. "So you <I>have</I> been thinking about taking him
away?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria quickly
responded, "No! I mean, he's a decent guy, but I'm
not going to take my best friend's boyfriend away from her."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"But you thought
about it?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I once thought
about going out with Upchuck too, and I rejected it only slightly
more quickly. I don't want to sacrifice our friendship for a
date that could go nowhere."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom jumped in to say,
"I'm not trying to ruin your friendship. I'm just
trying to hang out with two girls who are more interesting than all
the girls my parents have tried to set me up with combined."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane sighed. "Then
we need to figure out where we stand. You put your grievances on the
table, I'll put mine next to them, and we'll figure out
what's left. If we're done, we're done. If not, we
get past this and our relationship is stronger than ever."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom exhaled, thankful
that the situation had diffused. "Deal. I'll be honest
with you if you'll be honest with me, and that goes for what is
said and what's not said."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria stood and added,
"And on that note, I'm getting a to-go box for my share
of the pizza. Even if I thought I could help, there are some
relationship details I'd rather not hear."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
Eight</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria returned home and
found her mother at the kitchen table going through some legal
briefs. Helen saw her daughter enter and greeted her without looking
up. "Hi Daria. Back so soon?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria spoke in her
usual monotone. "Tonight's return home has been rained
out, so we are showing footage from a previous return home instead.
We apologize for the inconvenience." Daria looked around. "Um,
where's Dad?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen popped up her
head. "Oh, um, he went out to get some pizza. Quinn's
vegetables were all right for her, but the curry didn't agree
with either of us."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria looked at the
wall and saw a splatter of sauce. "It looks like the curry
wasn't the only thing disagreeing."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen saw the splatter
herself, noticing it for the first time. "Hmm? Oh, yes. I
suppose your father and I were a little worked up when I got home."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria grimaced. "Just
like the night of the fire? Mom, are you and Dad all right?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen, inwardly
cringing at her daughter's perception, tried to put on a bright
expression. "Oh, Daria, nothing's wrong with your father
and..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria interrupted,
"Mom, candy-coat it if you must, but tell me the truth."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen sighed. "Okay,
so we're fighting a little more often lately. I'm a bit
worried, but with both of our tempers, it's bound to happen
from time to time. We make sure to talk it out after we've
cooled down every time, though. You seem more worried than I am."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Well, the way
you're describing, it almost sounds like what Jane and Tom are
going through. They argue, make up, and don't address the
problems causing the arguments. Well, until today, anyway."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen made a mental
note of Daria's last statement. "Oh, well honey, that's
where your father and I are trying to be different. We don't
just apologize to each other and pretend it never happened; we try to
get to the bottom of what's causing the problem, and take steps
to fix it. Like this weekend, for example."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria perked her ears
up at that. "What about this weekend?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"After we got the
assessment from the fire, your father and I talked out the argument
we had that night. We looked at our finances and decided we had
enough to spend the weekend at a hotel. Le Grande Hotel is one of
Jake's clients, and they were able to cut us a good deal on the
weekend. We'll leave Friday night after work and come back
Sunday. You can have Jane over, but I need someone to make sure Quinn
doesn't start a party or stay out all night. That's why
we're not telling her until Wednesday."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Quinn might not
be able to coordinate her wardrobe in two days, let alone set up a
party she could get away with."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen rolled her eyes.
"All the same, I want you to be responsible for her actions. If
Quinn leaves the house, you'll be with her."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"And my
compensation for this?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Will be
negotiated Wednesday when Quinn's here to make counteroffers.
After all, she'll be pretty upset at being left with you as
well."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Not to mention
she'll need to have something to bribe me with to keep her
quiet."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Oh, you
shouldn't worry about that. I figure letting Sandi, Stacy and
Tiffany stay over will keep her from getting too tempted. She's
proven that she's smart enough to know when she's giving
Sandi blackmail material."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria nodded her head
approvingly. "You're getting good at this."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Thank you,
dear." Helen sighed, thinking about her husband and their
latest argument. "Don't worry too much about us. We've
had our issues, but we've handled worse times. We just need
some time to ourselves."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria ran her finger
over the splotch on the wall, brought it to her tongue, and frowned.
"If this didn't kill anyone, I guess you'll be all
right."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A couple hours later,
Daria was sitting in her room, typing away at her computer. Quinn
walked into the room, saying "Hey, Daria," in a somewhat
muted tone.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria replied, without
looking up, "Daria's not in right now. Please leave a
message at the tone."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn rolled her eyes.
"Whatever. Look, have you noticed that Mom and Dad have been
fighting more lately?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"There has seemed
to be a recent increase in the indigenous hostilities."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn sat down on the
bed. "Do you ever think that, well, maybe one day they'll
have a fight they can't get over?" Daria turned around
and faced Quinn. "And please be honest. If there's
something going on, I should know."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria sighed. "Quinn,
as far as I can tell, our parents' marriage is fairly safe. If
it can survive that curry sauce, it can survive anything."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Actually, that
was what stopped the fight."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"What?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"They were both
ranting and raving, and then Dad said he just wanted to eat his damn
curry. I heard him stop, and then he started yelling that it was
worse than the mint paste."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Ah, the wasabi
from Samurai a Go-Go."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn giggled a bit at
that. "That's Dad all right. After that they kind of made
peace and Dad offered to run for pizza. Are you sure they're
okay?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria shrugged. "I'm
as sure of that as I can be. I've seen a relationship on its
last legs, and this isn't that. Look, can you keep a secret?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn looked somewhat
confused. "Hmm, as long as I don't tell Stacy, or Sandi
if it might come back to hurt me, or Tiffany if..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Quinn!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn startled at the
interruption. "Oh, sorry. Yes, I can keep a secret if I need
to."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Mom and Dad are
spending next weekend at a hotel to, um, work out their issues."
Daria added finger quotes to the last phrase.
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn understood the
meaning. "Ewwwwwww."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"My thoughts
exactly. The upshot is that we're here all weekend, Jane and
your Fashion Fiends can come over, we'll get food money, and I
have to make sure you don't do anything crazy. No parties; I
mean it."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn spread her hands
out and said, "Don't worry. Sandi's been itching
for something to hang on me lately, and an unauthorized party would
be just what she wants." The doorbell rang. "When are
they going to tell me?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria rose to her feet.
"Wednesday; be sure to act surprised." Daria walked to
the stairs as Quinn went back to her room. When she was most of the
way down the stairs, she saw her friend, Jane, standing in the
doorway where Helen had greeted her. Her eyes were large, and her
lips drooped. Behind her, Jake stood with a pizza in his hand and a
worried look on his face. Daria waved her up to her room. Jane was
speechless as she ascended the stairs. When she got to Daria's
room, she closed the door.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn listened from her
room. <I>The only other time I heard Jane crying was that stupid
self-esteem thing, but that was obviously a fake. So that's
what Daria meant by a relationship on its last legs.</I>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane stared,
unblinking, at the ferocious beast before her. The large feline
stared back at her, as if preparing to pounce on its prey. Jane's
expression was deathly calm, as she pondered the predator before her.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane's brother,
Trent, walked up to his sister and asked, "Okay?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane took one final
look at the caged tiger before her, made sure she hadn't
forgotten anything, and finally said, "Okay."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Trent drove Jane
home from the zoo, she told him, "Thanks for the company,
Trent."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trent smiled at his
sister. "Hey, no problem, but why didn't you ask Tom, or
Daria?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane frowned. "I
broke up with Tom, remember?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trent frowned back.
"Mmm, that's right. I wasn't sure if I dreamt that
or not."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane rolled her eyes at
Trent's perception of reality. "And since I'm
spending the weekend at Daria's, I figured I'd spend some
time with you so that I don't accidentally O.D. on Daria. I can
only handle so much monotone voice."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trent looked
thoughtful. "So you chose to hang out with me?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane smiled. "Ok,
bad example."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trent cocked his eye at
Jane. "You're not still mad at her for Tom taking an
interest, are you?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane's smile
evaporated and she answered quicker than she'd intended. "No!
I mean, I don't think so. It's not like she was trying to
take him from me at the pizza place."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"It'd be
pretty hard to do that while you were watching her."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane continued, "And
at any rate, Tom promised not to ask her out until after the summer
to give me time to get over it, and Daria agreed to not even think
about it until summer started. I still get the feeling she's
interested in him, but I trust her." Jane turned away as she
ended her statement.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trent nodded, and
decided to change the subject. "Why'd you want to see the
tiger again?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane brightened at the
topic change. "I told you; it's a surprise. You'll
find out when everyone else does, which should be after this weekend,
if I can finish phase one before then."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"And how's
the painting coming?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Oh, just
finishing up the last part." Jane sat silent for a moment, but
then realized what Trent had said. "How did you know it was a
painting?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trent grinned. "Because
if it was me, phase one would probably be song lyrics."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane arched her
eyebrow. "I thought your phase one of your plan would be
'nap'."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trent shrugged. "I
don't really plan my naps. They happen whether I plan them or
not."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The next morning at
class, Jane and Daria were at their locker talking. "So, when I
come over to your house, you can help me out with phase two of my
break-Jane-out-of-her-funk plan."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria looked at her
friend, who'd been looking a bit better after the last two
days. "I told you, I'll be happy to beat him up, but I
won't kill Tom for you."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane looked
thoughtful"How about just a light maiming?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria shrugged. "I'll
think it over. So what is my part of this plan?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane held up her index
finger and shook it at Daria. "Ah, ah, ah! You'll find
out this weekend, and that's the soonest anyone will know about
it."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Anyone other
than you, or are you keeping yourself in the dark as well?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Actually I'm
hoping to lighten up the dark a bit. That's all the clues
you'll be getting today. Anything more and you'll figure
out the riddle."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria deadpanned, "I
don't know what you mean, Ms. Sphinx."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Down the hall came the
Fashion Club, with Sandi and Quinn leading and Stacy and Tiffany
following, as always. Sandi was talking. "Then it's
agreed, we will keep our Friday dates, then meet over at Quinn's
house that night and stay for the rest of the weekend to prepare for
our upcoming blush evaluation."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn followed up with,
"That's such a great plan, Sandi."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany added, "This
will be a fun weekend."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy came in with,
"It's so good of your parents to invite us for the
weekend, Quinn."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn smiled, and said,
"I know. It'd be nicer if they let me invite some guys,
but you know how parents are."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria, listening from
her locker, commented, "Yeah, they have a thing about letting
hot guys sleep in the same house as their daughter."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane smiled. "They
didn't seem to have a problem with you sleeping at my house."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria, undisturbed,
replied. "That's because Trent's your brother, and
if he tried to make a move, he'd fall asleep halfway through
and forget about it."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane arched an eyebrow.
"I notice you didn't argue the 'hot guy'
designation for Trent."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria considered this,
trying to keep from blushing. "I'd imagine that with how
often he shuts down, his core temperature has to run pretty high."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thursday night the
Morgendorffer family sat down to dinner, Jake's latest attempt
at Chicken Stroganoff. Jake and Daria read their respective sections
of the newspaper, Quinn thumbed through the latest issue of <I>Waif</I>,
and Helen spoke with her boss on the phone. "No, Eric, I won't
be reachable over the weekend. I'll have my phone on, but I'll
only be able to check it maybe once or twice a day. So that you can
leave a message if any extreme emergencies come up. No, a golf outing
does not count as an extreme emergency."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria looked up at her
father. "Dad, you're letting her bring the cell phone?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake looked over the
paper in front of him at Daria. "Well Daria, this weekend is
about building trust, and if I can't trust her to stay off the
phone, then what can I trust?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria smirked, "That
Mom said those exact words to you, and that Quinn is dying to give
the phone a new case to match her shoes."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn didn't look
up from her magazine as she said, "Please, at that point I'd
just get a new phone that isn't as chunky-looking. It'd
be like putting a 24-karat gold finish on a plastic necklace. Ugh!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen, still on the
phone, half-shouted in an exceedingly polite tone, "Look, a
fire, flood, theft, even a settlement would be important, but please
don't leave a message asking which tie to wear to court Monday.
Oh, well, I'd go with the navy tie myself."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria looked over the
section of news that Jake had been reading. "Where did you say
you were staying this weekend?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake smiled. "Le
Grande Hotel; it's such a luxurious resort, and because they're
one of my clients, we got a really good deal!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria pointed at an
article. "I would imagine so; after that arrest they'll
need all the good publicity they can get."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Yeah! Huh?"
Jake asked, looking at the article Daria pointed out. "'Bobby
Stuart was arrested today on multiple charges relating to the
near-fatal assault on an 18-year-old woman. Stuart, 19, met the
woman, whose identity has been withheld by the police, at Le Grande
Hotel, Lawndale, and allegedly convinced her to meet at the C'Est
la View Restaurant on March 27<SUP>th</SUP>. The woman was found
unconscious the next morning at the base of a cliff below the
restaurant. According to officials, Stuart was posing as a bellhop at
the hotel and bought various items for her from the hotel, charging
them to her credit card and deleting the charges from the hotel
computers before they were run.' What kind of a hotel doesn't
realize that one of its bellboys was never hired?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria put her hand on
Jake's hand. "The kind that's going to be in need
of a new ad campaign in the very near future."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake perked up a
little. "Hey, yeah! How about: "Le Grande Hotel: now 100%
genuine bellhops!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria shook her head.
"If I were the hotel, I wouldn't want to hear the word
bellhop any more often than I already have."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn looked up from
her magazine. "I'd focus on the comforts. That place is
so relaxing. I've heard they even have those cute little
plastic sandals you get in the spa that massage your feet when you
walk."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake smiled. "I
love those!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen ended her call,
upset as usual. "And he wonders why the crisis priority system
failed when he made my opinions on restaurants a critical priority."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria replied, "Unless
he's going out with a fake bellboy, at which point it might be
accurate." She handed the article to Helen to make her point.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen read through the
article, her eyes wide from the description. "Oh my, how awful!
I'm sure glad that didn't happen this weekend."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria deadpanned, "And
that you've stopped going out with bellboys."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake sat up firmly and
yelled, "What?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen rolled her eyes.
"Jake, Daria was joking. I wouldn't give you up for all
the bellboys in the world."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria chimed in with,
"Including the fake bellboys."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
Eleven</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Friday afternoon came,
and Daria waited for Jane in the living room, attempting to watch
some random sitcom. This was a compromise, as Quinn, who was also in
the living room, refused to watch <I>Sick Sad World</I>, and Daria
wouldn't agree to watch <I>Fashion Vision</I>. Quinn grumbled,
"I can't believe Mom cancelled my freaking date tonight.
It's not like that weird stalker guy was my date."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria, who was watching
the show about as much as she was splitting the atom, replied, "Yeah,
then she might have a complaint."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Like I would
even date him. I mean, sure he's kinda cute and stuff, but a
computer geek?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I'm fairly
sure the victim was unaware he did anything with computers before
their date."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn continued, not
acknowledging Daria's remark. "Anyway, Mom's backup
reason was just silly. Why would it matter if I'm home when the
other girls got here?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria smirked. "For
one thing, a little quality time with your friends could be a good
thing. Stacy could probably be talked into seeing things my way as
long as it didn't get her thrown out of your club, and Tiffany
would just agree with whoever's talking anyway."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn laughed at Daria.
"You wouldn't." Daria stared back at her sister,
who started to panic. "You wouldn't!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria exhaled. "No,
those two aren't the type of henchmen I'm looking for. On
the positive side, Sandi won't have the chance to snoop around
for incriminating evidence while you would have been out on your
date."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"True, but if she
found herself the first one here, she'd immediately head back
out, not wanting to look like her date was a total loser."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria looked at Quinn
sideways. "You really have your friends scouted that well?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn shrugged. "After
the whole dance near-fiasco, I knew that I had to be ready for her
power plays."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Shouldn't
the President be the one who doesn't need to make a power
play?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Only if she
wasn't convinced I was after her position. Honestly, why would
I want to be President and have to do all the work of keeping us
together, when I can be Vice-President and just lead by example?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria stood as the
doorbell rang. "Some day you two are going to bite each others
heads off."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn shuddered.
"Eeeeew! Vampirism is so gross! Well, except for that Interview
with Brad Pitt movie; he's good in anything."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria had opened the
door, where Jane awaited, so Jane overheard the comment. "I'll
bet he's even better in nothing. Hey amiga; ready for the big
reveal?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria shrugged. "As
long as you're not revealing you're secretly a vampire,
go for it."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Do I look like
Brad Pitt?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"No, but your
stubble is getting there."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Funny,
Morgendorffer." Jane carried her equipment to the center of the
room. She set up the easel with a canvas covered by a purple drape.
"Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your eyes!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn squinted at Jane.
"Romans?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane continued,
undaunted. "Behold, Phase One! Ta-da!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With that, Jane removed
the drape. Underneath was a picture of herself, which was very
realistic when compared to Jane's usual abstract style. There
were, however, two major changes: Jane seemed to be coming out of
some sort of jungle foliage, and her hair had several blonde stripes
running through it.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria commented, after
taking in the picture, "Um, very nice; or is it a cry for
help?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane replied, "Don't
you get it? 'The Lady or the Tiger!' Now you don't
have to choose."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Does this mean
you'll be ordering the pizza with entrails?" deadpanned
Daria.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane continued,
undaunted. "This is going to be my new look. And <I>you're</I>
assisting in the procedure."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria looked a bit
distressed. "I am?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn, who had looked
over the painting after Jane had revealed it, chimed in, "She
is?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane turned to Quinn
looking somewhat annoyed. "Yes; you see, Daria and I need to
bond after the last week and I'm pretty sure coloring hair is
one of those things us girls are supposed to do to bond."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn stood up,
defensive. "Look, what you two do for your bondage or whatever
is up to you, but dying black hair blonde is not for the amateur;
especially not stripes!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane, choosing to
ignore Quinn's first choice of words, responded, "The
<I>amateur</I>? Come on, it's just hair."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn frowned. "Hey,
if you want to end up with random patches of Upchuck-orange hair, go
for it, but if you want to look like this," Quinn pointed to
the painting, "then you'll need someone with experience.
I mean, if you wanted to paint the ceiling of the Christine Chapel,
you wouldn't get Joe's Painting to do it."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane thought this over.
"You have a point. So what, the Fearsome Foursome would be
willing to do this for an outcast?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I'll tell
them about your plans, and then I'll tell them Daria was going
to do the dye job. If that doesn't make them see my point,
nothing will. Besides, Sandi's always talking about reaching
out to the fashion-challenged."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria folded her arms.
"And I'm sure there will be the matter of compensation."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Well, normally
I'd say let me reschedule my date for tonight, but with the way
Mom's been that could be dangerous, and besides Brandon was a
last-minute replacement anyway. As long as you'll pay for the
dye and let the group of us shop for it at the Mall of the Millennium
tomorrow, I'd be satisfied."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane put her hand to
her chin, impressed. "Deal. I have to admit that I was
expecting a pretty deep gouge. What's the catch?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria answered that.
"Mom and Dad paid us pretty well for the weekend, but she has
to stay with us the whole time, so she's making us go to the
mall with them so that they can spend the money; what other catch do
you need?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake and Helen entered
their suite at Le Grande Hotel, as did a bellhop carrying their
luggage. Helen spoke first. "What a lovely room. This should be
a very comfortable stay."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake went to a dial on
the wall. "Look Helen, a dimmer switch!" He emphasized
his point by turning the dial several times, bringing the lights down
low and then back to full brightness in rapid succession.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen saw the bellhop,
who had set down their bags and was now looking bored. "Jake,"
she said calmly, as she gestured to the bellhop.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake took his hand off
the dimmer switch, then reached for his wallet, pulling out a
five-dollar bill. "Oh yeah! Say, how do we know you're a
<I>real</I> bellhop?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Jake!"
Helen snapped.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bellhop, for his
part, reached into his wallet and pulled out a laminated card. "Here
you go, sir," he said without any particular enthusiasm.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake read the card.
"Hmm, 'George Winsted, official bellhop at Le Grande
Hotel, signed Richard Johnson III, owner.' Neato!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen let go of her
frustration at Jake's lack of tact. "I suppose you've
gotten that question a couple times since last weekend."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">George shrugged,
saying, "About seven times so far today."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen looked at Jake,
and then to the money he was about to hand to the bellhop. Jake, for
his part, pulled out another five dollar bill and handed both to
George. "Well, here you go! Don't spend it all in one place!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">George betrayed no
emotion at the 100% increase in his tip. "Thank you for your
generosity, sir."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the bellhop walked
out of the room and closed the door, Helen said, "All right, my
phone is officially muted and put away. I've promised to not
talk about cases at work and you've promised not to bring up
your father or Corporal Ellenbogen."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hearing those names
brought Jake into a familiar frame of mind. "Lousy damn..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Jake!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I'm good!
So what's the plan now?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Well, there are
two things I wanted to do before the weekend is done. We need to have
a serious discussion about where our marriage is going, but I'm
not sure we should start off with that."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake hit his right fist
into his left hand. "You're right, Helen. We need to rest
and relax while we're here. Say, I wonder if we could get those
sandals that Quinn was talking about..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen scowled. "Jake!
That's not the other thing I wanted to do!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Oh yeah? Well
what was the other thing?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen's scowl
melted into a seductive expression. Jake's building anger
immediately subsided as he comprehended his wife's intentions.
<I>This is going to be a good weekend after all.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
Twelve</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Golden Heather
Blonde, Dewy Cornfield Blonde, April Wheat Blonde...I just want to
bleach my hair, not start a freaking farm."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria turned to Jane,
who'd been poring over the selection of hair dyes at Makeup
Mill. "Well, I'm looking for "Blonde as a Bat," but
so far no luck. It's a good thing we decided to let the Fashion
Freaks lead the way on this."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I'm still
not convinced the Fashion Freaks were necessary for this." Jane
looked around. "Where are said Fashion Freaks anyway?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"There was a new
display of waterproof mascara. I told them that if it took longer
than ten minutes, I'd come back for them."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At that moment, the
members of the Fashion Club were walking towards Daria and Jane after
their analysis of the display. "So why are we hanging around
your cousin and that art chick anyway?" asked Sandi


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany added, "They're
sooooo weird."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn answered Sandi's
question. "Well, Mom said that if we were going to go anywhere,
they had to be with us. However, the more important reason is that
we're preventing a major hair dye faux pas. You know how that
art chick's hair is jet black? She wanted my cousin to dye it
with stripes of blonde."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy looked terrified,
as usual. "Oh no! She'd end up with orange splotches
everywhere!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn continued, "And
since I was able to restore Brittany's color after that
terrible dye job..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany interrupted,
"Grey is sooooo not her color."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn again continued,
"I decided that the only decent thing was to do the job for
her."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi sneered. "Black
with blonde stripes? Like, is she trying to join the punk scene?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn shrugged. "I
think it's one of her art things. I'll show you the
painting she did before we start. It's a little weird, but at
least she's trying." They reached Daria and Jane, and
Quinn saw Jane reaching for a box that read "Autumn Barley
Blonde" and shook her head. "Jane, do you even know what
you're looking for?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane looked at the box
in her hand. "Well, I imagine I need something that says
'blonde' on the box, but otherwise no."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria chipped in with,
"I'm guessing a picture of an overly perky woman would be
a prerequisite, apparently."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn sighed and shook
her head. "You'd think an artist would know the
difference between hair dye shades."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane smirked. "That
was before I knew we needed a combine harvester."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake and Helen relaxed
in the whirlpool just beyond the hotel pool. "Ah, this is the
life," said Jake, who put his hands behind his head and
stretched. "I can't remember when I've felt so
good."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen looked over to
her husband at the other end of the pool. "It's good to
feel good, isn't it?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Oh, yeah. Kinda
makes you forget about me almost burning down the house, you know?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen shook her head,
embarrassed by her blowup. "Oh honey, I shouldn't have
jumped on you for that. It was a simple mistake, and I blew it out of
proportion. You put it out right away."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake looked to console
Helen, knowing he wasn't blameless. "Maybe, but I
shouldn't have let Daria go over to that friend's house
without letting you know."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I know, but
that's okay. You had a point about how I always seem to be
away."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two had been
inching closer the whole time. "Yeah, but that's what you
have to do for your job."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen raised her
eyebrow. "I thought we weren't going to talk about my
job."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake shrugged. "Well,
you weren't, but you didn't really say anything about
me."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Oh, so I guess I
can talk about your Father and how he ruined your childhood."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both Helen and Jake's
voices were slowly rising, and their expressions grew more upset.
"And I can say how Eric's making you do all his dirty
work so that he can take clients golfing!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"And I can
complain about how your father made you angry at the world and made
you reject authority!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"And I can argue
that if Eric didn't force you to be at his beck and call, you'd
be able to relax when you came home!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen's angry
look twisted into a smile as her voice lowered into a seductive
growl. "And I can beat you to those pink fuzzy handcuffs back
in our hotel room."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake smiled back.
"You're on!" Both parents scrambled out of the hot
tub and playfully teased each other all the way back to their suite.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
Thirteen</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane surveyed the scene
in front of her. In the center of the living room, a chair sat in
front of a large pillow. Quinn sat in the chair, with Sandi at her
right side and Tiffany to her left. To either side of Quinn were
small folding tables. Behind Quinn, Stacy was mixing ingredients
within a bowl in her hands. "You know, if you're trying
to convince me this isn't a sacrifice to the fashion gods, it
isn't working."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria, just behind
Jane, commented, "At least they haven't pulled out a
knife...yet."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany turned to the
two outcasts before her. "Knife? Wouldn't you cut hair
with a scissors?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi rolled her eyes.
"Tiffany dear, you can't cut hair at home and expect
fashionable results. Everyone knows that's what stylists are
for."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane snickered. "Tell
that to Trent. He still thinks that home trimmer kit's the best
investment he's made besides his guitar."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn, undeterred by
Jane's comment, spoke up. "Jane, you're about as
tall as me, and if you sat on this chair, I couldn't really get
to the back of your head very well. This will go a lot smoother with
your head between my knees."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane couldn't
stop a smile from forming on her lips. "I really wish that was
the first time I'd heard that."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria, catching her
meaning, rolled her eyes and said, "Am I going to have to smack
Tom?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane shrugged. "No
complaints here, but it wasn't him who said that. Thank Trent
for that one." Daria's eyes got wide. "He didn't
say it to me!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy, who, along with
the rest of the Fashion Club, either didn't comprehend their
conversation or wasn't listening, said, "The dye is ready
to go."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria smirked. "Last
chance to back out."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane shrugged. "Eh,
I might as well go through with it. Worst case scenario, I have to
dye it back to black. I have to at least try this. Besides, when it
works, I'll be making myself a work of art."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria shrugged back.
"And if it doesn't, we can still put you up on the
refrigerator."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane walked over to the
pillow and sat down. Quinn put on the gloves provided with the kit,
and motioned to Stacy. "All right, hand me the brush."
Stacy handed her the brush, and she continued. "Now, the bleach
in this dye might cause a little bit of pain, but after all, pain is
beauty."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane countered with,
"I'm willing to suffer for my art."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Quinn began brushing
the dye into Jane's hair, Sandi spoke up. "You know,
since you're making a change to your hair, this could be an
excellent time to reevaluate your wardrobe."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy jumped in with,
"Yeah, with two colors of hair, you have more options for what
outfits will coordinate with it."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany added, "Have
you considered hoop earrings?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane looked over to her
friend, who had a bemused look on her face. "I knew there was a
catch."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen looked over at
her husband lying next to her. "Honey, did you mean what you
said about Eric?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake was brought out of
his haze by that comment. "Hmm?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"When you said
he's making me do all of his dirty work and expects me to be at
his beck and call."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake exhaled, trying to
choose his words carefully. "Oh, well, yeah. I mean, that's
what it looks like to me."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen looked away. "And
to me, too. That's probably part of the reason I get so angry
at home. I spend so much time trying to hold his hand through his job
that I come home intolerable."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I've
noticed you tend to be more...sensitive after you talk with
him."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I know. He just
gets me thinking that I'm not doing my job if I'm not
pulling my share, his share, and whoever else's share he
decided to promise that day."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake, seeing where the
conversation was going, decided to say, "I guess my problem is
not thinking."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen, startled off of
her rant, said, "Hmm?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Like the fire. I
know it was an accident, but if I wouldn't have been so angry
at the waiter, I would have paid attention to the milk, or maybe
turned off the burner before I grabbed the towels. I definitely would
have turned off the stove before getting the mop."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Jake, sweetie, I
know you've thought through that moment over and over in your
mind, but it all worked out for the best. Both of us and the girls
are safe and there was hardly any damage."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I know; I just
wish I had thought more about it then instead of just reacting."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen put everything
together in her mind. "So I need to think less and react more,
and you need to react less and think more. Shall we try it?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"It's worth
a shot. Do you know what I'm thinking right now?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen looked up at
Jake, interested. "What?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake smiled. "Just
about holding you in my arms for a long, long time."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I think you'll
be pleased with my reaction."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane walked up to
Daria's room, wearing one of Quinn's older pink towels on
her head. "Well, that wasn't so bad."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria turned from her
computer. "Which part, the hair dyeing or the inquisition?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Oh, it wasn't
that bad. After I got them frustrated with my complete inability to
care about popular fashion and makeup options, it was fairly
entertaining. It's almost too bad you didn't stick
around."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"A discussion
with those four that didn't involve fashion or makeup? What did
you talk about?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"The effect of
Dadaism on contemporary culture, what else?" Jane tried to
convince Daria non-verbally that she was telling the truth, in vain,
and finally sighed. "Tom."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria's eyes got
wide. "Really?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane shrugged. "Hey,
you're a bit too close to the situation to be objective, and
talking to Trent about it is like talking to a brick wall, even when
he's awake."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"So you talked to
the gossip gals about it?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"It's not
like there are any rumors to spread about it, other than him dumping
me to get with you."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria frowned at this.
"Hey, I told you I'm not..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane held out her
hands. "I know, but that's apparently what the rumor
mill's been trying to run with. I really wasn't trying to
accuse you of anything."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria's face
softened. "I'm sorry; I guess it's still a touchy
subject. So what did they have to say about it?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane smirked. "Funny
you should ask..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
Fourteen</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane rolled her eyes
for maybe the seventieth time since her hair treatment began. "Look,
I appreciate your help and if I ever want assistance in choosing eye
shadow, I know where to get it, but please, please, PLEASE can we
talk about something, anything other than makeup and clothing!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn, trying patiently
to finish the stripe she was in the middle of, said "Okay,
okay, but don't expect us to starting debating Kevin Pollack
paintings or anything."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane exhaled. "Don't
worry about that. So what do you fashionistas talk about besides
fashion?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy answered, "Well,
um, there's guys, and upcoming social events, and, um,
nutritional options and stuff."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi added, "Not
to mention the latest news on what other popular people are doing,
especially when they jeopardize their popularity."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany came in with,
"We could also talk about guys."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi turned to
Tiffany. "Tiffany, I believe I just said that."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy looked
thoughtful. "Hmm, I could have sworn I..." She
noticed Sandi glaring at her. "Eep!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane let Stacy off the
hook with, "Well, I can't really help much with guys,
other than saying Tom is an elitist ass who deserves a good swift
kick in said ass."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn, now on to the
next stripe, said, "Tom Sloane, right? With that much money and
those looks, I'm not surprised."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane frowned. "He
seemed so much different when I met him. I mean, here was a decent
guy, loved bad movies and making fun of the world around him, and
treated me like an equal. All of a sudden, Daria finally starts
talking to him, and now I can hardly stop them from putting me to
sleep."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi smirked. "So
I guess that explains why Daria's going out with him now."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane turned her head
quickly. "WHAT?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn scowled. "Damn
it Jane, keep your head steady. It's a good thing I wasn't
applying when you jerked around like that. Sandi, Daria's not
going out with Tom."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi folded her arms.
"Oh? And how would you know that?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"She's my
si...cousin, and I have to keep track of her to make sure she's
not going to embarrass me. She hasn't gone out with anyone
since that Ted guy dumped her for a computer game."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi smirked. <I>Quinn
almost admitted that girl was her sister. So close.</I> "Well,
all the recent gossip has been that Tom dumped Jane to get to Daria.
One of the cheerleaders said she heard you arguing about that very
topic at Pizza King."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane sighed. "I
made that accusation, and they denied it. They promised they wouldn't
even discuss it until after the summer, and if I'm not over it
by then, there's something wrong with me."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi raised an
eyebrow. "And you believed them?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn glared at Sandi,
but Jane answered, "I believe Daria. Tom I trust about as far
as I could throw, but Daria will keep her head about her."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy shrugged. "Well,
thinking is what brains do, right?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany came in with,
"Sooooo then, this Tom guy is single?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane, hardly believing
Tiffany's question, replied, "Yes, but he thought I
needed to be smart like Daria. I doubt you four, no offense, would
fare much better."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn shook her head.
"As if you're not smart. I mean, maybe you don't
have the grades that Daria has, but look at how much you know about
art. I couldn't tell a Vermicelli from an Al Del Greco."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane looked confused
for a moment. <I>A who from a what?</I> "Oh, you mean a
Botticelli from an El Greco?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn shrugged. "See
what I mean?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi rolled her eyes.
"Of course; a rich, good-looking, reasonably fashionable male
and he's looking for a brain. No wonder he's going out, I
mean, rumored to be going out with Daria."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane raised her
eyebrow. "Jealous?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi, defensive, said,
"No, just remarking on the waste of a perfectly dateable guy
looking for a brain. I must compliment your taste in men."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Well, I didn't
go out with him because of his money; if he'd shown you his
blue rusted-out Pinto and told you he was rich, you'd call him
a liar. He didn't even mention his family's money until
the restaurant that night, and that was only because he mentioned he
went to Fielding Prep. I didn't even know he was a Sloane until
the third or fourth date."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn smiled at that.
"Wow, imagine going out with a guy for that long and then
finding out his parents are rich."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy added, "The
last time I found out something important on a third date was when
Craig told me he had to go away for a while, and that he wanted me to
wait for him."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn's smile
went away. "Stacy, wasn't that the guy who went to jail
for robbing the Stop and Snack a few months back?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy looked nervous.
"Um, well, that's why I broke it off. That and he left me
to pay for our dinner that night. I didn't find out until after
I got home that he was arrested trying to run from the Chez Pierre
when he said he was using the restroom."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane rolled her eyes.
"Stacy; for your own sake, please start questioning what people
say every now and then; at least for people you don't know
well." Sandi's grimace from the first statement faded
somewhat after the second part. "Anyway, like I said, I didn't
care about his money. He does look really good, but it was more his
attitude that attracted me. I gave him my lousy singing voice and he
laughed it off. We'd sit in front of the TV, make fun of whatever we
saw; it was the perfect relationship."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn looked at Jane's
hair quizzically. "That's a relationship? God, that
sounds more like what you and Daria do." Quinn thought for a
moment, and then gasped. "Wait, does that mean that you two
are..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane felt the eyes of
all four Clubbies upon her. "No, that rumor isn't true
either," Jane said forcefully, before adding, "Not that I
haven't tried."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All four Fashion Club
members yelled "Eeeeeeeew!" at this.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane smiled. "I'm
kidding; I'm kidding. We're both straight, from
everything I've seen. In fact it's the fact that we like
one guy that's the problem right now."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy spoke up. "Well,
has Daria ever let you down before?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane shrugged, afraid
that shaking her head would disturb Quinn's manipulations,
which had ceased a while back. "Not that I know of."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi butted in. "Well
then, I don't think you have anything to worry about. Daria
wouldn't be so uncaring as to throw away a friendship over a
guy she likes." Her tone of voice suggested to Jane that Sandi
may in fact believe this to be the case.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane returned with, "I
guess. Hey, how long is my hair going to take, anyway?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn answered, "Oh,
it's been done for about five minutes. It'll just be
twenty-five more to set."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane scowled. "Then
why didn't you tell me?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany responded, "It
was a good conversation."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy seconded, "Yeah,
it's not often we talk with someone outside our social circle."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi arrogantly
smirked. "Like, this experience will help us in case we have to
help any other unpopular people in averting fashion crises."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane grimaced as she
stood. "Glad I could be your window into the other side."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"You've got
to love how condescending shallow people can be when they're
trying to help," replied Daria, after Jane had finished telling
her about the conversation.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane smiled. "I
guess I can take comfort that they weren't trying to get me out
of their hair at the first opportunity. Speaking of hair," Jane
removed the towel from her head, "am I striped yet?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria looked at her
friend's hair before her. "Um, no, not quite yet."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane frowned and tried
to look up at her hair. "Is anything happening up there?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria looked
frightened, a look she had practiced in case this situation occurred.
"Um, I think I had better go downstairs to see what Quinn's
up to."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane walked over to a
mirror. "Oh, come on, how bad could it..." Jane
froze as she looked into the mirror. True blonde stripes alternated
through Jane's usual black tresses. Jane looked almost exactly
the way she had in her painting. "It's...it's...perfect!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria put on her
Mona-Lisaesque smile. "I'll warn Quinn about how it
turned out."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane, her mouth still
gaping at the vision in the mirror, came back with, "You do
that. Tell her that when I come down and kiss her, the rumors are
still false."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
Fifteen</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake looked over at his
wife Sunday morning and noticed the look of frustration on her face,
as well as the cell phone being thrown at the bed. "Bad news?"
he said, hoping that there was at least some justification for
Helen's messages.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There wasn't.
"Thirty-seven messages." Helen picked up her notes.
"Eighteen 'Just called to see how you're doing,'
seven blatant attempts to get me into the office, five vague
emergencies without any details, which I explicitly told him to give
if there was a real emergency, four requests for good jokes for his
golf buddies, and two inquiries about whether I, or my phone, was
dead."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake thought over the
numbers in his head. "That Eric is sure persistent. What was
the other call?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Hmm?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"The messages you
mentioned totaled thirty-six, and you said there were thirty-seven."
Jake was inwardly happy that he had paid attention and added the
numbers in his head.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen frowned and
looked over her ledger, trying to think of what she missed, but
inwardly happy that her husband was thinking instead of reacting.
"Hmm, that does...oh wait; I didn't mark down Eric's
wife. She said something about Eric shaking like he was going through
withdrawal and that I should call him back to calm him down. Dealing
with that man had better put me next in line for partnership."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake thought this over.
"Hmm, Vitale, Davis, Horowitz, Riordan, Schrecter, Schrecter,
and Morgendorffer; when you want the best legal representation, call
1-800-VDH-RSSM!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen's frown
evaporated. "Oh honey, I'm pretty sure they'll lose
one of the names before I get put up there. Either Mr. Davis or
Eric's father should be approaching retirement in the next
couple years."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"A couple years?
I'm surprised they haven't made you partner already!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen, not happy with
Jake's tone, answered with, "Well, they just put me on
the fast track this past fall after that retreat, and there are four
others that have seniority over me for partnership matters. Granted,
one of them has been on the "fast track" for the last
fourteen years. As you can imagine, she was none too pleased to be
passed over for Eric."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake considered this
thoroughly. "Helen, does anyone actually get promoted to
partner from the inside?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen took a step back,
thinking it over. "Well...Vitale and Davis were there from
the beginning along with Riordan's father, and Eric's
father was signed over from another firm that disintegrated after he
left. Horowitz was promoted to partner nine years ago after twenty
years with the firm, and Eric was promoted after six years, though he
obviously had some help."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"So by the time
you have the chance to make partner, you could be ready to retire."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Jake, it's
all dependent on who retires when. That woman in front of me has been
an attitude nightmare since I've known her, and one of the most
vicious backstabbers you'll ever meet. They don't have
grounds to fire her, no matter how many times they've tried,
but they'll never make her partner. That's why I'm
as cordial as I can be towards Eric. Two people ahead of me are
fairly likely candidates, but both Vitale's and Davis's
kids aren't going into law. All in all, my odds aren't
amazing, but they're worth the effort. Starting over at another
firm would be a crapshoot."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake sighed and sat
down on the bed. "I guess. I just realized this weekend how
much I missed having you around. I don't want you to give up on
becoming partner, but I do miss having you to myself."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen put her arm
around Jake. "I know; I've missed you too. I wish this
weekend could go on forever; well, with the kids in the next room. I
called Quinn while you were in the shower. Daria's friend Jane
actually agreed to let Quinn and her friends dye her hair. She said
it was supposed to be the Lady or the Spider."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake flinched. "Spider?
Ewwww!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen rolled her eyes.
"Relax, she probably meant The Lady or the Tiger. There's
an old story where a man has to choose between two doors: one has a
lady, the other a tiger."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake pondered this.
"Hmm, sounds like a good idea for a game show. The final wager:
give up all the money you won for a chance at two doors. Behind one
is a tiger in a cage, which means you lose. Behind the other is a
beautiful lady with a new car!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen looked at her
husband, trying not to just blurt out that Let's Make A Deal
had already been done. <I>At least he's trying to think.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Jake merged onto the
freeway, Helen was on the phone with Eric for the first time since
Friday. "Yes, Eric, I'm back to being available. Oh,
Eric, that's cute, but you know that's not what I meant.
No, really, that's not what I meant."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A careless Sunday
driver tried to merge into Jake's lane at the point he was
driving. "HEY! Watch where you're driving!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"What? They need
me in court tomorrow? I thought we'd agreed to a settlement!
They paid the fine with more counterfeit money? How did they pay for
our...no, forget it. If I'm representing them, I'd
rather not know how they can afford us, would I?" Helen sighed.
"That's what I thought; thank you for confirming my
suspicions."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Meanwhile, a pickup
truck tried to cross all four lanes of the highway in five seconds
right in front of Jake. "Dammit! Where did you learn to drive?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen looked over at
Jake, briefly concerned, but then switched her attention back to her
phone. "They're still not ready? Wasn't Ed supposed
to have those finished by this weekend? Next weekend; oh, right, but
doesn't he have some sort of wedding he's planning for?
Yes, his mother. I thought he asked for half the week off. Oh, don't
worry; I'll make sure he's on task, one way or another."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The car in front of him
slowed drastically, but did not have working brake lights, which
forced Jake to jam on his brakes and honk his horn. "Lousy
punks and their $100 cars! Why can't you change a lousy light
bulb?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen, scowling at
Jake, said, "Hang on a sec, Eric. Jake, calm down. You want to
give yourself another heart attack?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake, upset that this
particular saying had made a return, countered with, "Dammit
Helen, that car didn't have brake lights! I could have hit it
without knowing it was coming at me!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"At this rate,
you're going to cut somebody off or hit someone. Calm down!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I am calm,
Gah-dammit!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria crept down the
stairs to the sound of Jane snoring. Quinn's posse had already
left, and Quinn herself was in the kitchen preparing a light lunch of
a medium salad with a diced roasted chicken breast and a light
balsamic vinaigrette dressing. "Good afternoon, Daria."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria looked at the
clock. "Hmm, my clock said it was still before noon. I guess I
need to reset it." Daria went to the fridge to hunt for a meal.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn put her hand to
her head. "Oh, and tell Jane they make these strips that go
across your nose that help you breathe better at night. After seven
o'clock, none of us could sleep over her snoring. How did you
sleep so late?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria smirked.
"Earplugs; I've slept at Jane's house enough times
to know better."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The phone rang, and
Quinn picked it up. "Hello? Oh, hi Tom." Daria turned
towards Quinn as she spoke Tom's name. "Um, yeah, she's
here. One moment." Quinn put her hand over the receiver. "I
thought you two weren't speaking with each other."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria walked over to
the phone. "So did I." She took the phone from Quinn's
hands. "Tom?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the other side of
the line, at the Sloane mansion, Tom said, "Hi Daria! How's
it going?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria, flat as usual,
replied, "Oh, almost as well as before you and Jane broke up."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom's face fell.
"Oh. How's she been taking it?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Well, after the
first couple days she stopped asking for your head on a platter.
Right now she'd probably settle for a paper plate."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom rolled his eyes.
"Daria..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria knew what Tom was
going to say. "She's doing pretty well, considering. She
just had her hair dyed and she's been happy about that."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"That's
cool. Hey, that theater that had La Dolce Vita last weekend has 8 &frac12;
tonight. I was wondering if you wanted to go see it."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria's eyes went
wide at this suggestion. "Tom, both of us promised not to date
each other until after the summer, remember?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I'm not
asking you on a date; I just wanted to know if you wanted to see some
Fellini with me. If Jane or anyone else you know wants to come, she's
more than welcome."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Tom, even if
Jane hadn't slept through 8 &frac12; the first time we saw it,
I doubt she'd want to go anywhere with you right now."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom sighed. "Look,
I didn't mean anything by it. I was just hoping I could salvage
a friendship out of this."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria thought it over.
"I know. We're still friends, Tom, and I think that once
she gets over the breakup, Jane will be your friend too. We can talk
about it later, though. Right now she's staying over here, and
if she finds out I'm on the phone with you, she might get the
wrong idea."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Oh, I didn't
know...that would be awkward, wouldn't it?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Yeah. Well, I
guess I'll talk to you later. Bye."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Bye," said
Tom as he hung up the phone at the same time Daria did.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Bye," said
Jane, after both Tom and Daria had hung up. She put down the phone in
Daria's room and said to herself, "The Lady or the Tiger;
which will you be, Daria?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
Sixteen</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen walked into the
kitchen on Monday morning in her best court-appearance outfit.
"Sorry, no time for breakfast; taking this weekend off has put
me way behind on this case. I'm sorry, but the trial can't
wait..." Helen trailed off as she grabbed her
meal-replacement drink and looked around the empty kitchen, and
remembered why it was deserted. "Oh, that's right: nobody
would be up at 5 AM but me." She paused. "So who am I
talking to now? Damn counterfeiters getting me worked up!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Later that day, Jane
was at Daria's locker at school. "Look, I realize that
it's newer technology, but Action Dan the Action Man is a
completely superior game to Mutant Zombie Space Pirates Four."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria rolled her eyes.
"That's what you said about Splatter Up three months
ago."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane, undaunted,
countered with, "It was completely superior too, for the two
hours it took to finish it, anyway."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jodie chose this moment
to walk up to the pair. "Hey Daria; hey Jane. I love the hair."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane played with the
tress that covered her right ear. "Thanks. The person or
persons that performed the job wished to remain anonymous; otherwise
I'd recommend them highly."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jodie smirked at that.
"So I guess I should ask you: is it the lady or the tiger?


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane looked over at
Daria with a strange look in her eye. "Actually, I haven't
really decided. I guess I'll need to wait and see."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria noticed Jane's
gaze and started to speak when the Fashion Club came from behind her
and Jane.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi spoke first. "All
right then, our evaluation of blushes begins officially tonight with
presentations on some of the highlights and lowlights of the most
recent blush technology innovations."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany was next. "I
love technology."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn added, "Thanks
for volunteering your house this afternoon, Stacy. I promised Mom I
would keep everyone out tonight to prepare for the roundtable
tomorrow afternoon at my house."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy smiled as she
said, "Oh, I'm just happy to offer my home! I'm
pretty sure Mom was able to pick up the right refreshments, but if
something's missing, let me know."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria spoke as the
foursome passed. "I could tell her what's missing, but I
imagine she'd think a spinal column was gross."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane smiled. "Only
if you showed it to her in person. I'm sure they've done
posture lessons on how to pose their back to maximize their
cuteosity."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria added, "I
would call you on making up a word like that, but since they actually
used it on the cover of one of Quinn's magazines, I'll
give you a pass."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jodie groaned. "Don't
you guys ever get tired of picking on them?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria responded. "I
don't really consider that picking on them. I'm just
pointing out a fact. Stacy needs a backbone like Kevin needs a brain
and Upchuck needs a clue."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane added, "And
with that, they're off to see the wizard, the wonderful wizard
of Li!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jodie shook her head.
"Somehow, I see her as the last person I'd go to looking
for a gift."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn came home from
Stacy's house at about 6:05pm. She went into the kitchen and
saw Jake preparing in his Lasagna Carbonara and rolled her eyes at
the scene. "Dad, if you put in that much cheese and bacon in
without adding more sauce and vegetables, it'll get too greasy
and Mom's going to have a fit." <I>Not to mention I've
gained five pounds just looking at it.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake concentrated on
the pan before him and said under his breath, "It's a
little late for that."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn was fairly sure
she heard her father, but not that she understood him. "What?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake, realizing what
she said, looked up and said, "I mean, I've already put
one in the oven for tonight. This one's for later in the week."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn thought Jake was
covering up what he said, but noticing another pan was in the oven,
she responded. "Oh, well at least the next one will be a little
healthier. I've got to go up and make sure I didn't miss
taking off any blush from tonight's presentations."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake acknowledged
Quinn's plans, and set about to adding extra sauce and broccoli
florets to the pan before him. Quinn headed upstairs, but instead of
heading to her door, she knocked on her sister's door.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Would tonight's
mystery guest sign in please?" said the voice from Daria's
room.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn opened the door,
and found Daria at her computer, as usual. "Hey, Daria. Have
you seen what Dad's making for dinner tonight?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria stopped what she
was typing. "No, but he described it to me and I felt my
arteries harden as he spoke."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn shook her head.
"I know; it's like he doesn't care if I gain
weight. Not that you don't have room in those clothes for
another fifteen pounds or so."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria cocked her
eyebrow at that, then lifted her shirt to expose her midriff. "So
you want me to pack on the pounds?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn held out her
palms. "No, no. Even with all that junk food you eat, you're
at pretty much the weight you should be at. I'm just saying
that you could overeat for a month and those clothes would still
fit."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria shrugged. "I
like them a bit loose. They're comfortable."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn countered,
"They're hiding your body. I'm not saying you need
to start wearing skimpy outfits or anything, but please, try
something that lets people see what you look like. Tom might really
want to see that."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria got angry at
that. "Tom? I'm not even speaking with Tom. I don't
know why he called me up, but I'm not going to turn my back on
Jane!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn tried to pacify
Daria. "Okay, okay. I'm sorry." <I>Geez, touchy.
It's like that Shakespeare thing in English: I think she's
being too much of a protester.</I> "So how have Mom and Dad
been?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria snapped out of
her anger. "Oh, they've been quieter, especially since
Mom left to go back to the office."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn looked at Daria
questioningly. "Eric called her back?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria nodded her head.
"You'd think he could remember his day planner, or at
least go and get it himself. At least, that's what Dad argued."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn's face
fell. "Not again."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria sighed. "They
kept their voices down, but you could tell they were arguing."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn sat on Daria's
bed and punched her pillow. "Dammit, and they were doing so
much better when they came home yesterday."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria nodded. "It's
her job; I'm sure of it. Eric pushes her around because he can,
so she has to push Dad around, and Dad can only push her back,
thankfully not literally. They were probably fine at the hotel
without any distractions, but with everything back to normal,
everything's back to normal."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn looked angry. "I
hate this. We're their kids, but it's like we don't
even have a say! I almost want them to just break up and be done with
it."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria's eyes went
wide. "Whoa, I know you don't mean that."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn looked at her
sister. "But I do! If they're going to break up anyway,
then get it freaking over with. Otherwise, stop freaking arguing
every single freaking day! I just want them to be happy so that I can
be happy again." As she finished saying this, she started to
cry.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria walked over and
sat next to her sister on the bed. Quinn buried her face into Daria's
shoulder. "There, there. It'll be okay. We'll get
through this." Quinn dried her eyes. "Hey, if you feel
that way, tell them about it. I've told Mom and Dad how I feel,
but we both know you're more persuasive than I'll ever
be."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn sighed as she
wiped her eyes. "I know. I keep meaning to, but every time I
try, they seem like they're getting better, or it's the
wrong moment, or something else comes up."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria patted Quinn on
the back. "You'll tell them. You're my
relation-of-an-undetermined-nature after all."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn smiled at that
description. "Come on, Daria. Everybody knows by now that
you're my sister, except..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria finished the
sentence. "Sandi; and I can imagine why."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn smirked. "Well,
you tell me. Your chief rival for popularity wants to know something
that you think will ruin your popularity; not to ruin you right away,
of course, but to have something to hold over your head. You could
keep anything you think could be dangerous to yourself and worry
about what you're forgetting, or you could pretend that people
knowing that we're sisters is devastating, but let everyone
else know, confidentially, that it's the case."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria saw the genius of
the scheme. "Sandi thinks she has an H-bomb, so she stops
searching. When you force her to use it, it blows up in her face. And
why don't you put that kind of research and planning into your
homework?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn cocked an eye at
her sister. "Why don't you put that creative brain of
yours towards finding clothes that express your personality instead
of hiding it?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria looked down,
knowing she was beaten. "Touch&eacute;."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
Seventeen</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The next morning, Daria
walked down the sidewalk on her way to Jane's house before
school. Her thoughts had been unfocused until she got to the block
before her first destination, where a blue rusted-out Pinto pulled up
beside her. "Hey Daria," called Tom from inside his car.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria, her thoughts now
incredibly focused, waved back. "Hey."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom gestured towards
Daria as he rolled down the street. "Care for a lift?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria, seeing Jane's
house in the near distance, shook her head. "Thanks, but I'm
heading to Jane's house, and seeing you might set her off."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom scowled at that. "I
can't believe she's still that ticked off at me. We broke
up over a week ago. It's not like I cheated on her or hit her
or anything. Are you sure she's that angry?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria shrugged. "It
seems that way any time I bring up your name. I mentioned that we
could ask you for help with an economics assignment, since your
father works with the stock market, and she unfavorably compared it
to napalming the school."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom smiled. "At
least that would be fun, and you wouldn't have to worry about
the assignment anymore."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria smirked at that.
"That's what Jane said. Look, I'd suggest trying to
talk to Jane first. If you really want to stay friends with us, you
don't have to worry about my end of it."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom raised his eyebrow.
"So you like being friends with me?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria stopped walking
and blushed as she stammered, "Um, yeah; friends. It's
uh, good to have a third person to pick on. Well, that's Jane's
house. I gotta get going. Thanks for the offer."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"No problem. Good
luck surviving school." Tom drove off and smiled to himself. <I>I
knew it. Daria's ready, even if she doesn't want to admit
it. I guess tonight's the big night after all.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria continued walking
towards the house, unaware of the eyes that had watched her
conversation from behind a Venetian blind at Casa Lane.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anthony DeMartino stood
before his class after writing "Benedict Arnold" on the
board. "Continuing with our discussion of the Revolutionary
War, we will now discuss one of the more INFAMOUS military leaders in
American HISTORY. Does ANYONE know who Benedict Arnold was? KEVIN?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kevin Thompson,
disturbed from his thoughts of trying to implement a play-action pass
play on his next makeout session, responded, "Um, was he the
guy that made that breakfast with that Holland-Dice sauce?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mr. DeMartino tried, in
vain, to suppress his anger. "That's EGGS Benedict!
Brittany?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Brittany, concentrating
on wrapping her hair around her finger, responded, "Um, did he
marry Roseanne?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Mr. DeMartino
struggled with his inner desire to strangle half his class, he saw
Jodie raising her hand. "Jodie, would you please SAVE us from
this Wisconsin DEATH TRIP?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jodie lowered her hand
and said, "Benedict Arnold was a general in the Continental
Army that sold secrets to the British that would have undermined the
Colonist's base at West Point."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anthony exhaled. "Thank
you, Jodie. Now, does anyone else know what IMPORTANT location is
found at West Point TODAY? KEVIN?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kevin attempted, and
failed, to think this over. "Um, that's the factory where
they make that sauce, right?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anthony closed his eyes
and gave in to the pain he felt from banging his head against the
blackboard. <I>If anyone's going to hurt me THIS much, it had
better be ME!</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---<BR><BR>"Are
these rodents cute and cuddly, or has a disease driven them insane?
It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Squirrel, next on <I>Sick Sad World</I>!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria looked up from
the TV and over at Jane, who'd been quietly painting since just
after they had arrived at Jane's bedroom. "That's
just the kind of thing my Dad needs to see to drive him off the deep
end again."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane, not looking up,
said, "Mmm."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria, noticing Jane's
lack of response, added, "If he's not getting mad at his
father or his military school days, he's complaining about
squirrels."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane continued
painting. "Mmm."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria, wanting to make
sure Jane was listening, said, "Which is a natural reaction
after they tried to hold Mom for ransom."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane kept painting.
"Mmm."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria realized she was
getting nowhere. "Jane!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That got Jane to stop
painting. "Hmm, what?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"As much as I
don't want to go home to Blush-o-rama, it'd be nice to
talk to someone besides myself."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane muttered under her
breath, "Then why don't you go ask Tom."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria heard. "What?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane realized what she
had said. "Damn. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say
that." <I>Out loud.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria wasn't
convinced. "Come on, Jane. It's been over a week. You
can't be angry at him forever, especially when you both agreed
to break up. It's not like he dumped you for another woman."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane arched her
eyebrow. "Oh really, Morgendorffer."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria looked confused.
"What does that mean?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Come on, Daria.
I saw you walking along with Tom's car this morning."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria scowled, thinking
of the morning's uncomfortable conversation. "Hey, he
drove up to talk to me. It's not like I was rushing off into
his arms."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane asked, "What
did you talk about?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"He wanted to
make sure both of us would still be friends with him," Daria
said, which wasn't a lie, even if it wasn't exactly the
truth.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Both of us?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Especially you.
I told him that you were the one to talk to, since you were the one
still angry at him that your relationship didn't work."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane stomped her foot.
"I'm not angry with him!" Daria stared at Jane, and
Jane sighed. "Ok, so I'm still angry with him. It's
just that he made me feel like I was an idiot because I couldn't
care less about those bizarre arthouse films or the boring philosophy
books he'd been reading. We were going along fine, and then he
starts trying to intellectually one-up me every chance he got. I
swear it was like a game to him."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane sat down on a
chair facing Daria. "Look, I don't think he did those
things on purpose. He genuinely likes a lot of that stuff, and he
told me that when you dismissed most of the topics he wanted to talk
about, that it made him feel like you didn't care about what he
had to say."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane put her head in
her hands. "Yeah, I guess I can understand that." Jane
looked up suddenly as a thought came into her head. "Wait, when
did he tell you that?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria folded her arms,
upset with the direction this was turning. "At the Pizza
Parlor, just before you came back to threaten him with a new
definition of a pie in the face."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane thought this over.
"So it wasn't during one of your phone conversations?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria's eyes went
wide. "What?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane crossed her arms.
"Oh, don't try to deny that you two have been talking on
the phone."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria, getting upset,
replied. "He called me, once. We touched base, we talked about
you, and I ended the call. End of story. And how the hell did you
know about that anyway?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane, becoming equally
upset, answered, "I picked up the phone Sunday to call Trent to
see if we had anything resembling food in the house. I heard you
talking about me, so I stayed on the line. And to think I told him to
wait until after summer."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria's temper
kept rising. "To ask me out, not to talk to me. He didn't
think he was asking me for a date."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane snorted at that.
"Believe what you want to believe."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria narrowed her
gaze. "What does that mean?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane stood firm. "If
he's alone with a girl, that's a date to Tom. He told me
that himself when we were setting up what I counted as our first
date, but what he said was our second. Apparently going to Burger
World to grab a bite to eat counted as a date, so I would imagine a
freaking Fellini film would count too."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria shook her head,
trying one last time to calm things down, and at the same time
convince herself that Tom wasn't angling for her. "Even
if he was interested in me, I would never break my promise. You know
that."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane's
frustration would not be abated. "I thought I knew that. Now
I'm not sure of anything: not myself, not you, and definitely
not Tom."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria had had enough.
"You know, maybe I was wrong; maybe I should be at home. I can
turn up my headphones and drown out the Blushathon, and at least
there I won't be accused of betraying my best friend!"
With that, Daria stormed out of Jane's room.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane stood up and
yelled after her. "Wait! I didn't mean to..."
She sank back down into her chair as she watched her bedroom door
slam. "Good one Lane."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
Eighteen</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the time Daria had
gotten to within a block of her home, she had walked off most of her
frustration. She had even resolved to apologize for acting childish
when she went over to Jane's house the next morning. Maybe Jane
would admit she was being childish too. However, her plans went out
the window the moment she saw the car parked outside her house.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"So what I'm
trying to say is that just because a blush doesn't have one of
the top three brand names, that doesn't mean that you should
dismiss it automatically."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi looked across the
circle at Quinn, who'd just made the last statement. Ever since
the debate had moved from the kitchen table to Quinn's room for
the preparation of dinner, Sandi had been losing ground. "I'm
not saying that we should only focus on the top three brands, but
we've tested the other brands in the top ten, and they're
hardly comparable."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn returned the
volley. "That may be true, but Stacy found some really good
results from some of the new startups that haven't been around
long enough to make the top ten."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi looked over at
Stacy, who was preparing to back up her findings, and said, "With
all due respect, Stacy could have just as easily found more duds than
studs. Not everyone needs to take a shot in the dark on an unknown
brand when they look their best with the big three." Sandi
smirked as she finished her statement, knowing she'd made
another step towards proving her superiority, while Stacy's
self-confidence took another hit. Tiffany's silence on the
matter could be considered a smart position, though without any
additional information to add, the position was a matter of default
rather than choice.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn wasn't
about to let Sandi have the final word. "Sandi, just because a
brand..." Quinn cut herself off, however, as she heard the
voices from below her.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Dammit Helen,
I've had it! If I have to hear one more time about that damn
folding coffee cup..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen's response
to Jake's latest rant was inaudible to the four girls, likely
because Helen was trying to keep both of their voices down. Quinn
shook her head and went to begin again, but was interrupted again by
Jake.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"But I've
had my successes too! If only I'd spent more time with that
firm down in Highland..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen's response
this time was easily heard. "Oh, so it's <I>my</I> fault
you're on a downward skid?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake's responses
were getting louder. "Dammit, that's not what I said!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn buried her head
in her hands; she wasn't crying, but the only way she could
react was to hide from the situation.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy looked on in
concern, Tiffany looked on in confusion, and Sandi tried to take
advantage of the situation, as per usual. "Gee, Quinn. Having
both of your parents constantly arguing is quite an unfortunate
situation. I hope that this development will not cause you too much
stress, because that could drastically accelerate your aging process,
and I know you wouldn't want to develop any premature
wrinkles." Sandi finished her statement with a self-satisfied
smirk, unaware of the consequences of her action.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Inside Quinn, a switch
had been flipped. Her doubts, her insecurities, her desire to run
away from the pain; it had all been pushed aside. In its place, an
anger that had been building for several weeks had taken over her
mind. Quinn's head came up. Stacy and Tiffany saw immediately
her eyes filled with rage; her teeth gritted in determination; her
face red with frustration. From her lips, four words emanated in a
tone so even and calm, they brought fear into the hearts of both the
secretary and treasurer of the Fashion Club. "This meeting is
over."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi, who hadn't
been watching this transformation, began to say, "Excuse me,
but I believe that I, as Pres..."



<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn grabbed Sandi by
the lapels of her blouse and brought Sandi's face within an
inch of her own. As her eyes flashed with anger, she repeated, "I
said, this meeting is over."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sequence of events
scared Sandi more than the thought of someone finding pictures from
when she was forced to wear braces. "Um, er, yes, moved and
seconded, meeting adjourned," she said as quickly as possible.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All three friends
gathered their material and hurried to leave. Stacy, being the last
one to exit, stopped at the bedroom door. It took all of her courage,
self-control, and determination to turn around and say, "Q-Quinn,
if you need a place for the night..." Stacy cut herself
off and cringed as another volley was fired in the battle now being
waged in the kitchen.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was all Quinn could
do to nod her head and say "Thank you," before Stacy ran
off.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi ran along with
Tiffany and Stacy out the front door of the Morgendorffer house. She
had decided to wait until Stacy came out to be sure this wasn't
just some plot of Quinn's trying to get Stacy on her own. Even
in her panic, she was aware that the last thing she needed were her
friends becoming Quinn's allies.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As they ran off, she
realized there had been a car parked in front of the house; a blue,
rusted-out Pinto. She turned to look inside the car and grinned
evilly. <I>Heh, what do you know? At least the night wasn't a
total loss.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn stalked down the
stairs towards the kitchen and her parents. When she got to the
doorway to the kitchen, she saw what she expected: her father and
mother shouting at each other and pointing their fingers randomly
around the room. On the counter sat a half-full pitcher of a clear
liquid and olives, which she knew by then had to be Martinis, and an
empty bottle of relatively cheap wine, which to Quinn's
knowledge had been half-full last time she'd noticed.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen's latest
volley was, "I'm so sorry that I can't be around
every night for your pleasure, but the last time I checked, I was
paying most of the bills around here!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake's
counterstrike was, "Oh, so it's all right for Jakey's
business to be tanking three minutes ago, but now when you're
defending yourself, it's the main problem again!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn attempted to
interrupt. In a small voice, she started, "Dad..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen didn't
notice Quinn was in the room. "I'm not saying that at
all! Just don't make me a demon for needing to stay late every
now and then to keep my job!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn wrapped her
fingers around the empty wine bottle. She tried again, almost
undiscernibly louder. "Mom..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake hadn't
noticed either. "Every now and then? Try every single damn
night! If you're going to be gone all the damn time, I might as
well not even..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Jake had started to
edge his argument towards separation, Quinn raised the bottle over
her head and brought it down swiftly onto a sharp corner of the
counter.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The argument ceased as
the bottle shattered. Shards of wine-covered glass flew through the
air and onto the table and floor below. Quinn's adrenaline was
flowing as she watched glass fly around her, oblivious to the neck of
the bottle she still held like a weapon.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen was the first to
speak. "Quinn?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn immediately
responded. "Stop it! Just stop! I have had enough of this!
Every freaking night you're fighting like freaking dogs. I
can't take it any more!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake attempted to fill
the lull after Quinn stopped talking. "Honey, we're not
fighting about you..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn held out her
hand, palm facing Jake. "Stop. Don't even try that. I
know it's not about me. It's never about me or Daria. If
you stopped for one freaking moment to think about us, you wouldn't
be fighting. You're tearing yourselves apart and taking us
along for the ride. I just want peace!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen chose her words
carefully, somewhat afraid of her daughter's mental state.
"Quinn, what are you asking?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn swallowed some of
her anger. "I don't want to live through another two and
a half years of this. Talk this out, get some counseling, take some
time apart, even get a freaking divorce if you have to, but stop
fighting."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jake gulped at that.
"Divorce?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn shook her head,
the adrenaline wearing off. "I want you two to be happy
together. I want to have my mom and dad love each other forever. But
I'd rather get used to living without one of you than live
through you two destroying each other every night. I...I..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She trailed off as she
dropped the neck of the wine bottle. She took three long steps,
narrowly missing broken glass around her, and reached her parents,
who had by then moved together. As Quinn put her arms around her
parents, she broke into a full cry. Helen joined her, and Jake
allowed more than a few tears of his own to join them.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They didn't
notice when the fourth member of the family came in the front door,
walked quietly up to her room, and shut the door.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom watched as Daria
came up the sidewalk to his car. "Hey."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria scowled from the
moment she saw Tom's car. "What are you doing here?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom shrugged. "I
wanted to talk to you. We didn't get much of an opportunity to
talk this morning."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria looked at Tom. <I>He
seems fairly straightforward and honest right now. I'll ignore
the sirens going off in my head for now. Still, I'm going to
need some potential witnesses.</I> "Did you want to come
inside?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom shook his head.
"No, there are these girls in there, trying to redo the
Lincoln-Douglas Debates with makeup instead of slavery."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria let a grin escape
her expression. "That's just the current stage of the
Blushathon. In a moment they'll be breaking the discussion to
ask for pledges."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom smiled. "Well,
at least they're not trying to hold a Toyotathon. Why don't
you get in the car?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria's grin was
quickly forced off her face as she contemplated Tom's motives.
<I>Oh, what the hell. Maybe I can figure out what he wants.</I> She
opened the door, sat down in the passenger seat of the Pinto, and
closed the door behind her. "So, I'm guessing you haven't
talked with Jane, since she's been with me pretty much all day.
Did you want to talk more about her?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom shook his head.
"Nope."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria was a little
worried when that was all the answer he gave. "Um, so what
then?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom paused slightly. <I>No
guts, no glory.</I> "About our situation."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>I knew it.</I> "Our
situation? We can't have a situation, remember? I gotta get
going." Daria started to open the door.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom stopped her. "Wait,
why are you so mad at me?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria turned to face
Tom. "Why? WHY? Because when I moved here, I was certain that I
would spend my High School years alone and adrift, just like I spent
Junior High, and the only thing that stopped that from happening was
a chance meeting with another outcast; one who gave me a reason to do
anything more than keep my parents off my back. And now you come in
here and offer me the chance to throw all of that away for a freaking
date? Who do you think I am, Quinn?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom stopped her
ranting. "Look, all I did was find the same outcast and go out
with her for a while. It got boring, we broke up. It happens every
day. Now, because she's holding a grudge that I wasn't
her Mr. Perfect, you treat me like a pariah when all I want is
someone to hang out with that's less stuck up than I am."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria realized he was
telling the truth, but she wasn't about to back down. "I
promised Jane that I wouldn't even think about going out with
you until summer. Didn't she make you promise the same thing?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I promised I
wouldn't go out with you until after summer. I didn't say
I wouldn't spend time with you or talk to you, and I damn sure
didn't promise not to think about you."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria was starting to
let down her guard. "All right; like I said before, I want to
stay friends, but I'm not giving up my friendship with Jane to
do it. In her eyes, if we were to start doing anything right now,
we'd be cheating on her."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom nodded. "Exactly,
and what kind of jerks would that make us?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Exactly."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"All right then."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Fine."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both teenagers paused
for almost exactly two seconds. Then both turned their heads towards
each other. Daria was planning to make a point to Tom, but it was
quickly forgotten as Tom's lips met hers. They kissed
passionately, and both pairs of eyes instinctively closed. After
about five seconds, Daria's eyes flew open as she realized what
she had been doing. She pushed Tom's face away, and Tom barely
kept his head from bouncing off the window behind him. "Damn
it! Damn this car, damn that kiss, damn my promise, and damn you!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom rubbed his mouth
and scowled. "Hey, damn yourself while you're at it. You
liked it too."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria who was also
scowling, stared daggers at the boy who had dared to kiss her. "I
know; more than anything, damn me." With that, she dived into
Tom's waiting lips.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Minutes passed, and
finally Daria broke off the kiss. "Wow."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom smiled. "You're
not so bad yourself; even better than Jane."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mention of her best
friend brought Daria crashing back to reality. "Oh no; she's
going to kill me, and I'll deserve it."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom tried to calm her
down. "It's all right, Daria. If it helps, you can blame
me for it. I probably should have waited, but I just couldn't.
Just tell her it's all my fault"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria sighed. "I
can't do that. I can't lie to Jane."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom's eyes lit up
at that. "So you..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I'm just
as guilty as you are. Look, I gotta get going. I'll call you
after I put the pieces back together. However, since I've
already broken my word..." Daria reached over and gave Tom
one last kiss. "See you around." She fumbled for the door
handle before leaving the car.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Good night,
Daria." Tom watched Daria walk, unsteadily, back to her front
door before he restarted the car and drove away.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
Nineteen</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria woke up the next
morning. For her first hour of consciousness, that was the only thing
she was sure of. Her mind replayed the events of the last night
several times as she went through the motions of getting ready for
school. Her argument with Jane had seemed silly at the time, but now
seemed much more appropriate. The sit-down talk both parents had
insisted on to assure her they would do more to stop fighting seemed
like nothing but a blur. She was fairly sure her parents were too
busy trying to convince her they weren't getting divorced to
notice there was anything wrong with her. And then there was Tom. She
still didn't have an answer for that one.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She walked down the
stairs and into the kitchen. Her father was reading the newspaper and
talking to himself. "They're going to make it illegal to
shoot squirrels? What is this world coming to?" He saw Daria
walk in and sit down at the table. "Oh, hey kiddo!" Daria
didn't respond. "Still got a little stardust in your
eyes, huh? Don't forget, if you're upset about me or your
mother, we're here to...you can't drown them either?
Dammit!" Jake looked from the paper in front of him to his
watch. "Uh oh; gotta go! We can talk when you get home from
school if you want." With that, Jake ran off to his car to get
to work. Daria still had not said a word since she woke up.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn was the next one
to enter the kitchen. Any signs of the anger she'd shown the
night before had disappeared into her usual, upbeat manner as she
started fixing her breakfast. "Oh, Daria, I just wanted to tell
you that the Fashion Club will be completing the final phases of our
blush evaluation here tonight after all since Sandi's mother
wouldn't allow her to use their living room, so I'd
imagine you'd want to steer clear of here after school. I mean,
you're welcome to join us and stuff, but I know you care about
makeup about as much as I care about those weird philosotography
books you like so much. Okay? Thanks!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria, for her part,
barely moved.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn noticed this.
"Daria? Are you still worried about Mom and Dad? Because I
think my going off the deep end finally made them confront whatever
it was that was tearing them apart, and they spent most of the night
in the living room cuddling and talking instead of just going into
their bedroom and...you know..." Quinn shivered as she
usually did when she had to think about someone, especially someone
she was related to, having sex.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria finally looked
up. "Is Mom around?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"What?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria sighed. "I
think I need to talk to Mom. Not about the whole fighting thing
though."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn exhaled a bit,
relieved for a change in topic. "Oh, well good luck. She's
gone every morning before I'm even thinking about getting up."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria thought it over,
and finally decided to ask the only person she expected to see before
the inevitable showdown. "Quinn, if your best friend made you
promise one thing which seemed kind of silly at the time, but then
you broke the promise without them knowing, would you tell them?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn rolled the words
around in her mind, but they didn't seem to fit together any
way she arranged them. "Why would I promise something that
seemed silly? That sounds too much like something Sandi would do.
God, Daria, you've got to lay off all those books before it's too
late!" With that, Quinn grabbed the bowl of cereal and skim
milk with bananas she'd prepared and went back up to her room.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria walked down the
sidewalk past the Lane's house. She'd made the decision
to not walk to school with Jane, in case she needed witnesses when
she told Jane the news. As much as she wanted to dismiss what Quinn
had said, she kept thinking about it. <I>What if she made me promise
her so that I would break the promise? She's been mad at him
for far too long. If only I hadn't walked out on her. It made
sense at the time, but now...</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane saw Daria walk
past her house without stopping, only turning her head to glance at
the house. <I>Damn it, she's still mad at me. I better get out
there and apologize</I>. She grabbed her bookbag and ran out the
door.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane reached Daria
before she had gotten to the end of the block. "Hey!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria stopped. <I>Damn
it.</I> "Oh, um, hi."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane continued. "Hey,
I'm sorry about last night. I got worked up about Tom and
assumed things that obviously weren't true."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria sighed. <I>At the
time, maybe.</I> "Jane, you don't have to apologize."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane stepped in front
of Daria. "Yes I do. I've been acting like an idiot, and
you haven't deserved it."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria fought to keep
her composure. "No, really, you have nothing to apologize for,
Jane. If anything, I need to apologize to you."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane shook her head and
smiled. "Come on; you were justifiably upset with me. Besides,
it's not like you actually kissed him or anything."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria focused on the
ground beneath her feet.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane's smile left
her face and she became concerned. "I said, 'It's
not like you actually kissed him or anything.'"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria forced herself to
look Jane in the eye, but remained silent.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane's eyes went
wide. "I knew it. I freaking knew it!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria's gaze went
back to her feet. "It wasn't until last night."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane seethed, ready to
spring at Daria for thinking that had anything to do with anything,
but finally turned to leave. She said, in a restrained voice, "Go
to hell, Daria. I'm going home."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria reached for
Jane's shoulder. "Jane..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Daria's hand
touched Jane's shoulder, Jane turned around, drew her hand back
and slapped Daria across the face, yelling, "Don't you
ever touch me again, Morgendorffer! Leave me alone!" She turned
back and ran at top speed back to her house.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria stood there,
watching her former friend run away from her, and then sat down to
let the tears flow.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn gathered the
Fashion Club around her locker before third period. "I really
want to thank you guys for forgiving my temporary mental breakdown
last night."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi replied, "You're
more than welcome. The pressures of being one of the elite at
Lawndale High can get to almost anyone."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy chipped in,
concerned, "And please, if you feel like you might lose it
again, feel free to talk to me...or Sandi, or Tiffany for that
matter." She added the last part after Sandi started staring
daggers into her.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany, oblivious to
Sandi's stare, added, "We're here to help each
other."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn smiled, at least
on the outside, at her friends. "Gee, thanks guys. I don't
know how I would have made it through this without you."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just then, Jodie walked
up to the group. "Hey guys. Quinn, have you seen Daria at
school today?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn shook her head.
She only now realized that she hadn't seen Daria since she got
to school. "She was in the kitchen when I got breakfast, but
she was gone before I left. It's not like her to miss school."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jodie nodded. "I
know. Have any of you seen Daria, or Jane for that matter?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi spoke up, eager
to use her latest ammunition. "I haven't seen that brain
since last night, when she was sitting in an old, beat-up car in
front of Quinn's house."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn looked at Sandi,
confused. "That's strange; Daria doesn't have a
car, and why would Trent be driving Daria home five blocks?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy, suddenly
remembering the events of last night, chimed in with, "That's
right; I saw that car too! It was this blue, rusted out Pinto. Kind
of an ugly car if you ask me."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany tried to bring
the description and her memory together. "Blue, rusted out
Pinto...it's like I've heard those words before..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn remembered the
description from Jane's conversation, and then heard Daria's
words in her head. <I>Quinn, if your best friend made you promise one
thing which seemed kind of silly at the time, but then you broke the
promise without them knowing, would you tell them? </I>"Oh
Daria, you didn't."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen paced back and
forth in her office, ranting at nobody in particular. "How do
these people expect me to get anything done for them when they refuse
to do anything for me?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Marianne, Helen's
able secretary, came to the office door. "Helen, there's
someone here for you."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as Marianne
finished getting her words out, Helen responded back. "Who is
it? I told you I have no time for visitors or anything else until we
have a case!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Marianne stepped back,
and Daria, her face still somewhat red from her tears and Jane's
slap, stepped forward. This snapped Helen out of lawyer mode.
"Daria?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
Twenty</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Settlement was a
popular restaurant for tourists and locals alike. Tourists came for
the d&eacute;cor and the "Best Crabcakes in Maryland"
(making it one of only 247 Maryland restaurants to have been given
that distinction by one media source or another.), while locals came
back for the fast service and reasonably priced lunch specials, as
well as the "Best Waffle-Cut Fries in Lawndale" (which
was a much more unanimous decision).


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On this particular
afternoon, Daria and Helen Morgendorffer sat at one of the booths in
The Settlement, splitting a basket of said fries (with Helen
deferring the cheese cups to Daria) while Daria explained the last
couple weeks. "So that's pretty much it. I finally get my
first kiss, and it's from the one guy my best friend
specifically asked me to avoid for the sake of our friendship. Now
I'm lost and confused and I don't have anyone to talk to,
so here I am talking to you."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen, sounding
disappointed, said, "Oh."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria shook her head.
"That's not the way I meant that to come out."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen, understanding
and more upbeat, replied, "Oh. Well, Daria, you're going
through a lot of changes and things are..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria interrupted,
"Mom, I need another puberty speech right now as much as I need
a rant about squirrels. I kissed my best friend's ex after she
practically threatened me not to."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I'm sure
it was just a quick, innocent..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"For about two
minutes straight."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen put her head into
her hands and sighed. "It's a terrible spot to be in,
Daria, but it's not like you helped Tom cheat on her."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria conceded that,
partially. "By a matter of days. She was already convinced we
were going out when they broke up. I wanted to prove that her
friendship meant more than any feelings I had for Tom."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen arched her right
eyebrow. "And to do that, you denied that you had any feelings
for him whatsoever. Then, when the moment arrived, you were mad at
Jane, sick of denying the way you felt, and taken by surprise, so the
offer was tempting enough that you couldn't refuse it. Then,
after that one kiss got through your wall, the dam burst."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria sighed. "That's
the part I really don't understand. After the first quick kiss,
I could have gotten out of the car and told Jane that Tom tried to
kiss me. She'd get mad at him and we'd continue on."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen shook her head at
her daughter. "And you'd lie to yourself and Jane about
your feelings until the next moment of weakness. Look, let me use an
example that's purely hypothetical and in no way relates to my
current caseload."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria, realizing that
Helen meant that it came directly from the case she'd been
working on, said, "Okay."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen began her story.
"Suppose there's this man who wanted to be a law-abiding
citizen, but life was hard for him, and everywhere he turned he saw a
way to get everything he wanted for almost nothing. Let's say
he'd learned how money was printed and how to get the materials
he needed from working for the US Mint for ten years. He tried not to
think of it for months, even years, after leaving the job, but it
kept creeping into his mind. Then, one day, his friend tells him that
he's got a printing press for counterfeiting money, but that
the quality is terrible. The friend really needs the money, or else
he'll lose his house, his car, his job, and his child.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"He finally
agrees to show the friend what he was doing wrong; the press ran too
hot, the ink was wrong, that sort of thing. Eventually they started
making realistic counterfeit money that seemed to be his ticket out.
His friends were getting out of debt, he was living on real food
instead of ramen and bologna, and nobody was on his back about old
debts he'd run up trying to live on food stamps and odd jobs.
Before he knew it, he'd made $4,000,000 worth of some of the
most convincing fraudulent currency the US government had ever seen.
You see, after you take the first step forward, the next thousand are
that much easier to take."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria frowned. "So
you're comparing me to a counterfeiter?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen rolled her eyes.
"Daria, I'm not trying to call you a criminal. I'm
just saying that you may have done the wrong thing, but it was for
the right reasons. Now you can be strong and do the right thing for
your friendship, or you can keep doing the wrong thing over and over
until you're attempting to pay for your defense with
counterfeit money and illicit drugs, allegedly."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria's frown
softened at that. "Thank you for reminding me why I'm not
going into law school. So what were the right reasons again?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen swallowed the fry
she'd popped into her mouth while Daria spoke. "The main
reason was that you wanted to get yourself out of a no-win situation.
You knew how Tom felt about you. Jane knew how you felt about him,
even if you wouldn't admit it to yourself. You knew she was
being unfair in asking you to wait that long. If you hadn't
kissed him, she'd probably continue getting more and more
paranoid until your friendship was ruined anyway."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria wasn't
fully convinced. "At least then it wouldn't be my fault."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen shook her head.
"No, then you'd have gotten angry with her again for what
she's been doing, your friendship would be just as ruined, and
she'd be the one looking for guidance from her mother."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria smiled a little
at that, thinking about Amanda Lane's response, or at least
Jane's likely version of it. "If you hold a butterfly in
your hands it will die. You have to let it be free, and hope it
doesn't land on your best friend's hands. If it does,
you'll have to squash it. And her."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen smiled. "See
what I mean?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria looked at her
mother, taking in what had been said. "Mom, thanks again for
seeing me, considering your case load."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Helen took in the sight
of her daughter before her. "Oh that's all right, Daria.
Think of it this way: my daughter, who rarely opens up to me and
keeps her problems to herself 99% of the time, shows up in the middle
of my workday looking like she's ready to come apart at the
seams. On the other hand, I have some lowlife scum with somewhat
decent intentions whom I've never met and are trying to get my
firm in deeper trouble to cover their behinds, allegedly."
Helen held out her hands. "Daughter in trouble; scum that could
cost me my job." The hand she gestured to first sank down,
while the other rose up like a catapult. "And anyway,
considering the way you looked when you showed up, I thought you were
going to tell me you were pregnant."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria smirked at that.
"Trust me, Mom; if I was, you'd have to prepare the guest
room for three kings."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane sat at the kitchen
table at her house. Her thoughts were scattered, but they became
focused as a familiar musician entered the room.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Yo," said
Trent.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Hey,"
replied Jane, still staring at the table.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"What'cha
doing?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Thinking."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Hair came out
great."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Thanks."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Talk?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane considered this.
She had to tell someone. "I don't really know."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trent, aware enough to
know that Jane would normally be in school now, said, "Come on,
you only miss art class when it's serious."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An hour later, Jane sat
in Trent's car while Trent drove. "Hey, you know, about
the whole thing with Daria, it'll be okay."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane sighed. "Yeah,
I know. A part of me thinks it was better to have it happen now than
after summer anyway."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trent shrugged. "Maybe
it was."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"So how come I
feel like I'm being stabbed in the back?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trent looked over at
his sister. "I don't know. Did Jesse leave the hanger for
his vest on the seat again?" He smiled as he finished.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane smiled back, in
spite of herself. "Idiot."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trent turned back to
driving, and then realized he'd lost an important bit of their
previous conversation. "Where did you say you wanted to go?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane's smile left
her face as she leaned onto the door. "Tom's house, then
Daria's."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The doorbell rang at
the Sloane Residence. Tom came to the door, not expecting anyone.
When he opened the door to see Jane standing there, he was concerned;
partly because he hadn't expected to see Jane in a long time,
but mostly because her hands were clenched in fists. "Oh, hi
Jane," he said, without any particular enthusiasm.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane's voice was
even less enthusiastic, "Yeah, hi."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom tried to lighten
the mood. "So, would you like to come in, or would you rather
stab me here in the entryway?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane shook her head as
her lips came as close to a smile as she'd let them get. "Nah,
your corpse would look much better slumped over the sofa."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I'm a real
idiot," said Tom, sitting on the swing set in his parents'
backyard.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Who's
arguing?" said Jane, sitting on the next swing over.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I should have
made my peace with you first before I went after Daria."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane cocked an eye at
Tom. "You mean you should have never gone after Daria in the
first place."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom shook his head.
"No, I would have done that regardless of whether I'd
kept my promise to you or not. I would have waited until the first
day of school, and asked her then if I had to. I even had it planned
out."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane looked down at the
grass. "I guess I was hoping you'd find someone else, and
I'd be able to keep Daria to myself."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I'm not
taking her away from you. She talks about you more than you talk
about her, if that's possible. Sure, we'll want some
alone time from time to time, but you'll still probably see
more of her than I will."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane smirked. "Unless
she lets you past second base."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom realized what Jane
meant. "Hey, that didn't bother me. The physical end of
the relationship was never an issue. If I had a statue of your body,
I'd never sell it."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane considered this.
"Thanks. You're not getting me to make that statue, but
thanks. Daria's not so bad to look at herself."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom shrugged. "I
haven't really thought of her that way. I mean, I probably will
eventually, but right now I really like getting into conversations
and debates with her."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane rolled her eyes.
"Great, all that stuff that put me to sleep will make her come
to life."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Jane, I never
had a problem with what you didn't know, but I always figured
that if it meant enough, I could at least tell you about it. I just
couldn't get past all those times you shot me down for bringing
up something I thought was interesting. It made me feel like I didn't
mean anything to you."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane thought this over.
"Yeah, I can see how you could think that."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom chose his next
words carefully. "You're a really cool person, Jane. I
hope someday we can make another attempt at our friendship."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane looked into Tom's
eyes. "Me too; especially since you might end up dating my best
friend."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom smiled a bit. "I
really hope Daria still wants to go out with me after this."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane looked back at the
ground. "I'm sure she will. I'm just not sure
whether she'll still be my best friend when she does."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
Twenty-One</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria had returned from
lunch with her mother three hours before when the front doorbell
rang. She turned off the television in the living room and walked to
the entry. She found the person she'd expected ever since she
came home on the other side of the door. "Hi," she said.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Hello,"
Jane responded.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Pizza?"
Daria offered.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane shook her head.
"I'm not hungry."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria nodded. "Neither
am I."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria led Jane into the
living room. With no parents around and Quinn not expected back for
another hour or so, the two girls were alone. "Jane, I'm
sorry I kissed Tom," said Daria, sinking into a chair.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane sat down on the
sofa. "No, you're not."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria looked up,
confused. "I'm not?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane shook her head.
"No, you're sorry that you had to do it behind my back."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria thought that over
for a second. "That may be a more accurate depiction of my
feelings, yes."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane posed a question
to Daria. "Do you know why I asked you to wait until summer,
Daria?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria tried to figure
out what answer to give. "Well, I imagine you didn't want
to see Tom any time soon, but you also wanted me to prove I wasn't
trying to take him away from you before you broke up. I kinda botched
that one."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane folded her arms in
front of her. "Big time; it's a good thing that wasn't
my reason."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria looked across the
room at Jane. "Oh, so what then?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane sighed. "I
was giving Tom enough time to find someone else to go out with."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Ah."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Yeah. I mean,
it's April. That's, what, five months before the end of
summer, and more than enough time for Tom to find someone new if he
wanted to. Then I wouldn't end up losing both of you."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria was still trying
to see Jane's point of view. "Why would you be losing
both of us?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane sat forward to
lean towards Daria. "Look, if you're spending all your
free time with a guy that I don't want to see for a long time,
I'm not going to see all that much of you, am I? I wasn't
ready to face that."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria shook her head.
"Jane, I wouldn't spend all my free time with Tom."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane held out her index
finger. "Hey, that's what I said the day after I met him
at the Zon. Wasn't that a fun couple months for you? We got to
see each other, oh, twice a week after school, maybe? How many of our
daily walks to and from school were shortened by a blue, rusted out
Pinto?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria couldn't
argue. "You're right. I'd probably spend a lot more
time with him, and you'd have that much more time alone.
Whereas, if you got your way, Tom would have found someone else and
left both of us alone and we'd be back to where we started.
Except..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane continued Daria's
sentence. "Except that all summer you'd be questioning
what might have happened. Well, here's what would have
happened: Tom would have shown up on the first day of school and
asked you out."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This surprised Daria.
"Really?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane looked down. "I
got it straight from the jackass's mouth. And as much as I knew
it would hurt me now, it would probably hurt me just as much then,
knowing that he only waited because I asked him."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria looked down as
well. "So does that mean you're not upset that I kissed
him?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane's head
snapped back up suddenly. "Of course I'm upset! I told
you to stay away from him! What made you get into his car?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria held up her
hands, defensively. "I just wanted to find out what he was
doing at my house! At least, I think that's what I thought."
Daria sighed. "I should have just left after he said he didn't
want to talk about you."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane smirked. "The
Lady or the Tiger; I guess my choice didn't matter after all."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria replied, "I
told you, Jane; I tried to do what you..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane explained, "That's
not what I meant. Look, I knew I couldn't have Tom. At the same
time, a part of me knew that you would be happier with him than
without him. My options were to let him go after you or try to rid
him from my life entirely. I was so angry at you, him, and myself
that I tried to unleash the tiger on everyone, but you wound up
together anyway. I guess it was meant to be."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria shook her head.
"I don't know if anything's meant to be. I don't
even know if we're still friends anymore. I want to be, but
that's kind of out of my hands right now." She looked
over to Jane with hopeful eyes.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane looked into
Daria's eyes, contemplating her likely future with or without
Daria as a friend. "Be honest with me. Before Tom and I broke
up, were you thinking about going out with him?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria paused before
answering. "I didn't think so at the time, but looking
back, I realize how jealous I was, and how much I had wanted a Tom of
my own. I fought it for a long time because I didn't want to
lose you as a friend. I thought that if you knew I had feelings for
Tom, you'd blame me if and when you two broke up. Once you two
did break up, there was only the promise to hold me back, and last
night that promise wasn't enough. After holding back for so
long, I couldn't help myself. I know that it doesn't
excuse what I did, but it's the truth. If you never want to see
me again, I understand."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a moment, time
stopped. Daria's explanation was exactly what she wanted to
hear, the unvarnished truth, but it didn't make Jane's
decision any easier. In the end, the words she spoke were the truth,
but they were still the hardest words Jane had ever had to say.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"You're
still my friend, Daria."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria's face
softened with relief, grateful for what those words meant to both of
them. "You're still mine, Jane."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The moment passed, and
Jane felt the need to lighten the mood a bit. "Just don't
expect me to tag along with you and Tom for a while. Ex or not, I'm
not ready to buddy up with the boy whose corpse I just painted in as
many poses as I could think of. I'm calling it 'The 1001
Deaths of Tom Sloane', but that's really just hyperbole.
I don't have nearly enough canvas for that, and I haven't
come up with that many ways of killing the bastard just yet."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria shrugged. "Hey,
by the time all of this is over, I may be able to help you come up
with more. After all, I found a reason to fall for Tom, just like you
did, so maybe I'll find a reason to dump him, too."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane smirked at that.
"Now, now; don't go getting my hopes up. Seriously, you
two have a good time and try to make it work. As much as I want to
see Tom suffer, I still want to see you happy. I mean that. Also,
it'll be that much more satisfying when you do dump him for
being the loser I've come to know."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria returned the
smirk. "See; I knew you would eventually warm back up to him."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane shook her head.
"Going through hell tends to warm people up quickly. Speaking
of which, I'm really sorry I slapped you."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria rubbed the side
of her face. "That's all right; it was an appropriate
response, given the situation, and I was pretty numb to the world at
the time. Besides, now I know who to call if my sister ever fails to
repay a loan."
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane smiled and stood
up. "Ten percent is all I ask. Listen, I think we should take
the rest of the week off from the whole 'best friends'
thing. I've dealt enough with you and Tom for the last two days
to last the rest of the week."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria nodded. "Yeah,
I can imagine you could stand to put me out of your head for a while.
See you in class, though?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane nodded. "Yeah,
I can't really afford to miss the rest of the week over this.
See you before school Monday at my house?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria smiled. "I'd
like that."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane smiled back,
sadly. "I hope I will too. Bye." With that, she walked
out the door, leaving Daria standing alone.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn walked up to
Daria's open door. As she looked in, she saw Daria sitting on
her bed, staring at the cordless phone in her hands. She watched for
a few seconds, as Daria made no movement to suggest she would be
dialing any time soon. "Hey Daria," Quinn said without
energy as she walked into the room.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria turned to Quinn
and said, "Hey."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn sat down next to
Daria. "Trying to call Tom?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria set the phone
down and looked down at her feet. "Yeah, but not getting
anywhere. So Mom told you about Tom and me?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn shook her head.
"No, Sandi did."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria turned her head
sharply towards her sister. "Sandi?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"She saw you two
kissing as she was running from my tirade last night."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria calmed her
nerves. "Oh; that makes sense."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn continued. "How
did it go with Jane?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria shrugged. "She
slapped me, ran away, came back and ran me down for what I knew I did
wrong. Somehow, after all that, she still wants to be my friend."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Wow, she must
really care about you to forgive you like that."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"I'm not
sure if she forgives me or not, but at least she isn't blocking
me out of her life."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn looked at the
ceiling. "Just imagine, the stress finally gets to both of us,
and you're the one going out with a boy behind someone's
back."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria smiled a little.
"And you're the one snapping at your parents and breaking
things, although I found that hard to believe this morning when you
were your usual chipper self."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn sighed. "You
know, life's not exactly a bowl of berries for popular people
either. Forcing myself to look happy is how I get through my life. I
wake up, shower, put on my clothes, put on my makeup, and put on my
attitude. Granted, most days that's easy to do, because it's
the way I really feel. Days like today though, well, that's why
I do it. If I came to school looking depressed or crazy, forget it.
The teachers would be all over me, Ms. Li would force me see Ms.
Manson, and my whole public persona would unravel. It'd be like
you showing up looking concerned for someone's well-being or
passionate for some cause instead of making wisecracks and being
sarcastic."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria remembered a line
from a song she'd heard on the radio. "'I'm
not a man of too many faces. The mask I wear is one.'"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn didn't
understand. "Hmm?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria shook her head.
"Just something I heard once; don't worry about it. You
know, you're really not as dumb as you act."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn started to get
upset, but then gave Daria a bashful smile when she realized what
Daria meant. "Yeah, I know. You're not really as
heartless as you act."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria smiled back. "No,
but..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both said together,
"Sandi is." Both laughed when they heard their voices in
unison.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn got up to leave,
but turned around before she did. "You know, maybe that's
why I'm afraid to tell people I'm your sister. Maybe if I
was the one that had to wear glasses at age three, I'd be you
and you'd be me."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria saw what Quinn
was saying. "Maybe; I think you'd still be a brat, but
who knows?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn smiled. "Hey,
if you could pull off being a brat, you would too."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria replied, "Maybe;
I guess it's a good thing for both of us that I got the
glasses."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn laughed. "Yeah.
Imagine trying to pick a Jane out of the outcasts in my class. Well,
good luck calling your boy." As she walked out of the room, she
added, "Quinn."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria understood what
Quinn meant and smirked. "Thanks, Daria." As Quinn left
the room, Daria picked up the phone. After holding it for a few
seconds, she dialed a number she'd memorized that night. The
phone rang twice.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A familiar voice picked
up. "Hello, Sloane Residence."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria smiled. "Hi
Tom."
