<p class=MsoNormal>The black line snaked across the white canvas, twisting and
turning, following the lead of the moistened bristles.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It looped back upon itself, spiraled,
and ended on a point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Soon, other
lines of color followed, tracing out an abstract pattern, filling the white space,
until the whole of the canvas was alive with color, bursting with energy and
emotion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The patterns looked as
though they wished to leap from their two-dimensional world and envelop all of
the world around them, transferring both the melancholy and the joy of their
creator to all viewers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That's it for class today, everybody.<span

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane Lane cleaned her brush before placing it into the
storage jar, satisfied with her work for the morning, and took off her
paint-splattered apron.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
assignment had been to create a spontaneous abstract work in the space of a
single three-hour class period, and looking over the result, she was satisfied
with the way that it had turned out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>School had long since disabused her of the notion that creativity
required special inspiration, and she was confident that she could now turn out
a quality piece of art on demand, even within three hours if necessary.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This abstract wouldn't stand among her
best work, to be sure, and all the training two years at BFAC could give her
couldn't replace time to refine and mold, but, for the conditions under which
it was born, Jane could feel proud of this particular work.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And fairly certain of a good grade,
which Jane had never felt was absolutely necessary (at least, not as long as
she passed) but certainly never felt bad either.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As she stood there in quiet contemplation, a shadow fell
over the vibrant hues of the painting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Jane looked over to see that it belonged to the instructor, Professor
Patrick Simpson.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just Patrick,
really; Jane had never heard him referred to by anything but his first
name.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was even how he signed
his own works, some of which Jane had seen hanging in a few local
galleries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane stood aside to
allow him a better view.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's not quite Jackson Pollack," she said, "but then, you
haven't seen my work on a truly grand scale."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She smiled at an old memory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Very nice, Ms. Lane" Patrick responded, turning from the
canvas to face Jane directly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I
certainly wouldn't mind seeing more of your work; in fact, I want to talk to
you about something that could lead to exactly that.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Could you walk with me to my office?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You can come back and get your
equipment later."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Am I being kept after school to clean erasers?" Jane said
as they started to walk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Nothing that unfortunate, I assure you," Patrick answered
with a chuckle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"In fact, something
the very opposite of unfortunate, I think.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Are you familiar with the Patterson Gallery?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Are you kidding?" Jane said.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"That place is great!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I did everything but sleep there my first few months in Boston.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They had some of the most interesting
pieces I've ever seen there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
didn't have anything even close to that back home in Lawndale."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I thought you might be a fan," he said as he opened the
door to his office and motioned Jane to a chair.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The place was cluttered with art supplies, as well as a few
works-in-progress, but the chair was empty at least.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And comfortable, too, Jane thought as she sat down.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Patrick leaned back in his seat across
from her and a foot up on a third chair to his left.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"I'm a friend of the owner, Katherine Patterson, and every
year she has a showing for up-and-coming artists, to introduce people she
thinks are going somewhere to the community at large.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And every year she asks me to suggest my most promising
students for the exhibit."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
paused, and Jane could feel her frame locking into place and her eyes widening
in anticipation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"This year, I
want you to be one of the new artists on display."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane's heart leapt up, and she could feel her breathing
quicken.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was the moment that
she had been working towards for two years; really, this was the moment she had
been working towards her entire life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Her inauguration into the wider world of art.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Stay cool</i><span style='font-style:normal'>, she
thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>Don't act like
an idiot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Show him that you're
ready for this.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'll be sure to leave a note for my posthumous
biographers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You'll get the credit
for realizing my genius before I died."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><i>Well, maybe that's a little too cool</i><span style='font-style:normal'>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But Patrick just laughed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm trying to make sure that I get that credit much
sooner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a tremendous
opportunity for you, Ms. Lane.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Are
you up for it?"</p>

</span>Wine, cheese, big artistic mucky-mucks from all around Boston . . . that

the two of you to be there."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane, Daria, and their mutual friend James McCarthy sat in
their usual Tuesday lunch spot, a table in the corner of the BFAC Student
Center cafeteria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Conversation
buzzed around them, but the excitement emanating from one particular member of
the group drove all that away, leaving no distractions from her good news.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That's great, Jane," Daria said, and the smile on her face
made her sincerity obvious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"You
really do deserve this."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, I do, don't I?" Jane responded, and turned to James,
who was in the process of chewing a mouthful of the fries he had ordered with
his hamburger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She didn't say
anything, just cocked an eyebrow. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, I totally agree," he said, after swallowing.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"That's fantastic, Jane.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Congratulations."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His response was not underwhelming, but
there was no doubt that the news delighted him less than it did Daria.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Still, he had only known her for two
years, as opposed to Daria's more than five, so Jane was willing to let it
slide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Is this going to be some hoity-toity
affair?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Black tie, and all that?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"God, I hope not," Daria said with a grimace.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Jane gets irritable in heels."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I do not," Jane replied, with an indignance that was only
partly feigned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Just because I
lightly tossed them away when I was done with them didn't mean that I was
irritable."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane, the heel lodged an inch inside our wall!"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>James did his best to suppress a giggle
at Daria's reminder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"All that means is that we live in a cheap apartment."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane turned to James, who was still swallowing
a chuckle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"And as for you, didn't
you say that you were going to fix that hole sometime?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'll get to it," he said.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"Besides, you haven't exactly offered to make it worth my
while."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Maybe after my show, I can afford to."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What makes you think that it's money I want?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Listen, virgin-boy, money is all you could handle from me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>James's cheeks gained a slight red glow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So," Daria said emphatically, as she wondered which of the
two of them to douse first with her cup of ice water, "black turtleneck and
beret, then?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"And if you could grow one of those pencil-thin mustaches,
that would be great," Jane said, switching gears with the ease of long
practice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I guess I'll have to stop waxing, then."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>James's forehead hit the table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I did <i>not</i><span style='font-style:normal'> need to
hear that," he said, his voice muffled by the plastic tabletop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You'll recover," Daria said, "unless you've suffered severe
psychological shock, in which case I'll get my mother to pay for your shrink
bills."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She turned to Jane.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"When is the big event?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"This Sunday night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Can you make it?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It should be fine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I have an assignment due Monday, but I have real problems if a few hours
Sunday night make a difference.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You have anything, James?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Nothing I can't procrastinate away," he said, raising his
head from the table.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I'll be
there."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Great!" Jane said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"It wouldn't be the same without the two of you.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, Jane Lane will be exposed to
the entire world!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Are you going to be holding the show at the Toppers
Gentleman's Club down the street, then?" Daria said with an upturned lip.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, not that exposed.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Not me, at least.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I will be showing that one picture of Eduardo . . . "</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane, I am so glad I never thought of dating you," James
said with an exaggerated sigh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I
would have just ended up another nude painting in your collection."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, but that would have been a small enough payment for
the education I would have given you."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Jane wiggled her eyebrows at him with a smirk.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>James kept silent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria rolled her eyes, wondering if James would ever realize that he
would never beat Jane at the innuendo game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Are there any non-obscene paintings you're planning to
show?" Daria asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"My Eduardo painting isn't obscene, just . . . celebratory."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Patterson Gallery was not large, just a few medium-sized

filled with paintings clamoring for attention.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The artwork filled every corner with color, contrasting from
the otherwise nondescript interior.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was obvious to Daria that the keepers of this place saw this building
as a tool for the preservation of the artwork it contained but that otherwise
stayed humbly anonymous.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
rather liked the effect; there were no distractions, no ooh-ing and ah-ing over
the house itself to divert attention away from the talents of the artists whose
work lay within.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other times Daria had come here with Jane, the place had
been nearly empty, and they had been able to enjoy the displayed pieces in
contemplative quiet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not so
tonight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>People milled everywhere,
filling every nook and cranny of the building, murmuring to each other - some
presumably about the artwork on display, others no doubt about completely
unrelated matters, as they were there solely to be seen - and carrying glasses
of wine and little paper plates of refreshments.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><i>I can't really fault them on that last</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>, Daria thought, looking down at her hands, which
held an identical set of items.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There had been a time when being confined within a crowd of this size,
constantly forcing strangers into her personal space, would have seriously
unnerved her; she wasn't that sensitive anymore, though she was still far from
at ease.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At least it wasn't only strangers being forced into her
personal space.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane was at
present trapped within the circle of well-wishers and art-lovers that had
surrounded her shortly after they had arrived, but James was standing just a
few feet away from her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He might
have been even less comfortable than her, however, since he was being forced to
contemplate Jane's rendering of Eduardo, and his face had turned decidedly
red.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria didn't know whether to
be glad or disappointed that Jane was not around to see him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Looking around, through the crowd, Daria could see most of
the works that Jane had on display.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Seeing the fruit of several years' work collected here, it was obvious
that Jane's pre-college fears had been baseless; she had not lost her own
style, her unique voice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rather,
her style had been refined and enriched.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She had incorporated influences from throughout history and around the
world, and had absorbed them into herself, to produce works that spoke her own
words with a vastly expanded vocabulary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Her styles were more varied now - though she still specialized in the
surreal and bizarre paintings of the kind that she had produced in high school
(now executed with a good bit more elegance and skill), there were also figure
studies (including that one infamous nude), abstracts, and even a few
landscapes (though landscapes far from the peaceful scenes popular in cheap
hotels the world over).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Seeing
this, Daria felt a swell of pride in her friend, a delight in all that Jane had
accomplished; she really did deserve this.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And the best thing of all was that Daria knew that Jane
enjoyed every minute of her work; she embraced every assignment and project
with relish, eager to bring another expression of her inner self into the
world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria only wished that she
could remember what that felt like herself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After a few minutes, the crowd began to move on to another
section of the building, leaving Daria and James more or less free.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria could just feel herself mentally
expand into the open space, relishing the freedom, as James turned from the
painting and walked over to her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Y'know, normally I like realism in art, but that's a bit
too realistic for me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Actually," Daria responded with a straight face, "I'm
pretty sure that's more Jane's fantasy than reality."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Is this the voice of experience speaking?" James asked with
both eyebrows halfway up his forehead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Just a basic knowledge of human anatomy."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>James continued to stare at her.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"And I accidentally ran into him one
time walking down our hall after a shower.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I think he and Jane thought I wasn't home.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At least, that better be what they
thought."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, I see," he said, and turned to stare at another
painting, this one an array of geometric shapes and abstract swirls.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After a minute, he tilted his head to
the side and narrowed his eyes, then gave a small sigh.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>James had once confided to Daria that
he did not "get" most of Jane's art and that he felt a bit guilty about that;
he had never told Jane herself that, and Daria had never broken his confidence,
but she wondered at times if Jane had an idea of it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If she did, though, she never brought it up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"And here I was thinking that you had stolen another one of
my boyfriends," Jane's voice said from behind her.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria and James both turned to see her grinning widely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Maybe a little too widely.</i><span style='font-style:
normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria wondered exactly
how many glasses of wine she had drank.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></span><i>She deserves to celebrate, though; I just hope she doesn't
regret it too much tomorrow.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Isn't this great?" Jane said.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"I've already met all sorts of artists, gallery owners, and
critics from all over the area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Some of them are pretty cool, too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There was this one creepy guy who kept trying to get me more wine, but
other than that, it's been great.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Actually, he was kinda cute; when this thing is over with, I might look
around a bit to see if he's still here . . . "<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She trailed off with a lopsided grin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Glad to see you're enjoying yourself," Daria replied with
only a hint of sarcasm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Everyone
seems to be enjoying your work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
think you're a real hit, Jane."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Her mouth stretched in a genuine, completely un-ironic smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria's right, Jane," James chimed in.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"It's a great start to your artistic
career."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"And to my ultimate scheme of world domination," Jane
replied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Soon, everyone here will
be enslaved by the subliminal messages I've hidden in all my paintings, and
will march forth to conquer the world on my command.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Don't worry; both of you will get high-ranking positions in
the New Order."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'll be happy with Chief Executioner, thank you," Daria said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Spymaster Chief for me, thank you," James interjected.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"And to get a headstart on that, I
think I'm going to check out some of the other artists here, if the two of you
don't mind."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I expect
a full report on my competition."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, ma'am," James said as he walked away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I thought you didn't believe in artistic competition,"
Daria told Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, I suppose I have learned a few things in art school,"
Jane replied with a sly grin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"And
speaking of the cutthroat artistic world, I have someone to show you."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane guided Daria through the crowd
into another room, which looked to be the new epicenter for the crowd.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She pointed out one man in particular -
tall, slim, with a thoughtful expression on his face.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>At present, he was standing in front of a large
cubist-inflected work, writing in a small notepad.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"Do you remember me telling you about Daniel Dotson, one of
my instructors at that art colony I spent the summer at?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"The <i>poseur</i><span style='font-style:normal'> who
nailed more of his students than his paper plates?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Is that him?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Nope.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That's
Franklin Cardonelli, an art critic for the <i>Globe</i><span style='font-style:
normal'>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daniel had a showing
here in town about a year ago, and Cardonelli completely ripped him to
shreds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He's the only critic I've
ever read who saw through that man's bullshit and called him on it."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The look in Jane's eyes was pure
admiration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So, he's your new hero?" she asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Not 'hero', exactly, but definitely a great guy.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And he's here to review <i>my</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> work; I can't think of anyone who is more likely to
get it."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane was practically
hopping in excitement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I have to
go say 'hi' to him."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane, are you sure this is a good idea?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You don't want to look like you're
kissing up."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'll be calm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I just want to meet him."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Without another word, she strode over to Cardonelli, with Daria doing
her best to keep pace behind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Mr. Cardonelli, I'm Jane Lane," she said when she reached
him, sticking out her hand with gusto.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Cardonelli took it, looking a bit surprised at this new presence at his
side.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, yes, Ms. Lane.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>One of our guests of honor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It's a pleasure to meet you."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He shook her hand firmly, with a pleasant but non-committal look on his
face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Really, it's my pleasure," Jane said.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I had to shake the hand of the man who
called Daniel Dotson a 'pretentious, vapid, laughable excuse for an artist'".</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cardonelli laughed heartily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Glad to meet a fan," he replied.<span style="mso-spacerun:

community."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I had to spend a summer with that blowhard.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Knocking him from the sidelines was one
of the few real bits of fun I had."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The two of them shared a laugh, and Daria coughed discreetly.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Oh, I'm sorry.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Cardonelli, this is my best friend,
Daria Morgendorffer."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Good to meet you," he said, shaking her hand, "and please,
call me Frank.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I haven't been over
to your room yet, Ms. Lane, but I'm looking forward to seeing the work of a
woman with such obviously good taste."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"We'll get out of your way, then, so you can get to it
sooner," Jane said, and the two of them walked away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That went well," Jane said, her smile splitting her face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next day, Jane showed up for lunch at Raft waving a copy

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"My review is here!" Jane declared, ignoring the both of
them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"My review is here!"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was sitting down at the table now,
but she looked as though it would only take the slightest encouragement for her
to be bobbing up and down on her ankles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class=MsoNormal><i>She must have run halfway here</i><span style='font-style:

must have been a great review.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Are you famous now?" James asked.<span style="mso-spacerun:

from now on?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't know," Jane replied, calming slightly.<span

together before the big unveiling."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Let's have it, then," Daria said, curious and a little bit
worried.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She hoped Jane wouldn't
be too hurt if the review was not wholly positive.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She never usually worried about critics, but she was rather
worked up by this one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria tilted the paper towards her body slightly, in an

yes">&nbsp; </span>Just one bastard's opinion."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She paused for a moment, staring down at her food and
bending her plastic fork over her fingers until it was almost to the breaking
point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I don't think I have much
of an appetite today, and I've got some stuff to do anyway.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'll see you later."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She stood up and walked away from the
table, the paper falling unnoticed to the floor beneath her.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>James stood up to follow her, but Daria
pulled him back to his seat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm going to see if she's alright," he said in protest,
shocked that Daria would stop him in his mission of mercy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Do you really not know the answer to that?" she said.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Trust me, she wants to be alone right
now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Hopefully, she'll be feeling
better tonight; you can come by then to check on her.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If she's still in the dumps, we'll both talk to her.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But not right now.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She's probably going running, since she
doesn't have class for the rest of the day, and there's no way you could keep
up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Which is exactly how she wants
it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>James nodded in understanding, or at least acceptance, and
the two of them went back to their meal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Neither of them really wanted to discuss the situation any more, but to
talk of anything else seemed absurd, so the rest of lunch was passed in
silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria arrived back at the apartment around eight that night,
after a long day of classes and a study session with some of her fellow
Journalism students.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was Jane's
night to cook - an event Daria usually looked forward to, since years of living
nearly alone had gifted Jane with cooking skills that Daria absolutely did not
possess.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But the table was bare
and the kitchen obviously unused.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It wasn't like Jane to forget or slack off about this, and Daria's
worry, which she had pressed to the back of her mind for most of the day as she
got her necessities accomplished, now hit her full force again.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>I had really hoped she might be
feeling better by now, just shaken it off and gone on.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If she hasn't, she must be really
hurting.</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The door to Jane's bedroom was closed, but the light was on
and Daria could hear motion within.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></span><i>I think she's probably been alone long enough.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Are you
there?" Daria called as she knocked on the closed door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yo, <i>amiga</i><span style='font-style:normal'>, come on
in."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The voice was muffled coming
through the wood, but other than that, it sounded pretty normal.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe Jane was doing alright after all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Opening the door, Daria could see Jane at her easel, working
intently on a new painting, her brush sliding rapidly over the canvas, the tip
of her tongue peeking out from the corner of her mouth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Keep that door open," Jane said as Daria walked in.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Even with the window, the fumes were
starting to get to me in here."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So, were you planning on eating tonight?" Daria asked,
starting out lighthearted to try to feel out Jane's condition.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Or are the paint fumes enough for
you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Dammit, today is Monday, isn't it?" Jane said, as her brush
never stopped moving.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Sorry,
Daria, I forgot all about it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've
been pretty busy all day, and I haven't even stopped to think about food, or
anything else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'll make it up to
you later, but tonight you'll have to do for yourself.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've got too much I have to do."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her eyes never left the canvas,
drilling holes into the cloth and wood before them.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><i>She's more intense about it than usual</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>, Daria thought, </span><i>but she is painting, and
that has to be a good sign.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
lunch, I was afraid she wouldn't be interested in working at all for a
while.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane, not paint?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How foolish can you be, Morgendorffer?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So, what is this?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Another class assignment?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Not exactly. <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>Patrick was out of his office today, but I called Ms.
Patterson after lunch, and she told me that any work I complete before my
showing ends in a month, I can switch for one of the paintings already on
display.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is my introduction
to the art world, and I want my best work out there."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane," Daria said, her worry increasing, "just because
Franklin Cardonelli said . . . "</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, this isn't about him, not just him anyway," Jane
said, interrupting her sharply.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I
know that's how the 'real world' is going to work.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Just because Frank's a bastard who stabs his friends and
admirers in the back - " she punctuated her words by stabbing her brush down at
her canvas, and as she continued to speak her strokes became stronger and more
aggressive, her choice of colors harsher "- doesn't mean he's completely
wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of my work is a bit .
. . underdeveloped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I'm going
to show all of them what Jane Lane is capable of.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm going to give them artwork that will make them stand
back in awe of what a human soul is capable of feeling.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm going to make that son of a <i>bitch</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> Cardonelli eat his words."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>With this last statement, she slashed a broad red line
across her painting, like the wound left by a heavy knife.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane, are you sure you don't want to talk about this?"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria realized that she had actually
stepped back a stride, startled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, I'm fine, really," Jane replied, the angle of her
eyes never changing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Yes, I'm a
bit angry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So what?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I think I have a right to be.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I need to do this anyway, and I'm
not going to be able to rest until I have work that will stand up to any
criticism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I know you're worried,
but you don't need to be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just let
me work."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This last was obviously
a dismissal, from the conversation if not from the room.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But it still hurt.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then Daria's stomach rumbled.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Well, cooking and eating will be a
distraction from all this, anyway.</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She walked out of Jane's room.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane waved a goodbye with her brush,
but remained focused on the painting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She had not looked at Daria once.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria quietly fumed as she ate her sandwich.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At lunch, she had been too much in
shock to fully register the effect of Cardonelli's harsh words on her friend,
but now that she had seen the results up close - the pain and anger in Jane's
stance and words, hidden behind a very thin smokescreen of determined work -
she was furious at the man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
one thing to not enjoy Jane's work, or even to think it lacking in talent, but
that review had been cruel beyond any excuse of criticism, to the point of
obviously intending to cause pain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And he had been so friendly in person, so personable; Daria could hardly
believe the review had been written by the same person.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Maybe he does this to everyone, sets
them up and then lowers the boom, just to satisfy some selfish need to make
himself feel important.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I wish I
had read his reviews of the other artists, but I don't have the paper anymore.</i><span
style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
felt personally betrayed, and she knew if she felt it, than Jane must feel it
double.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The bread and ham tasted
like ashes in her mouth, and she chewed and swallowed only out of habit, her
mind otherwise occupied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A knock at the door interrupted her internal tirade,
bringing her earlier instructions to James to the forefront of her memory.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>That must be him.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Well, Jane certainly isn't feeling
better, but good luck with talking to her.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>James strode in when she opened the door, and wasted no time
getting down to business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"How is she?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Angry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Bitter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Frustrated.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And very busy."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria waved to the closed door leading
to Jane's bedroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"She got
permission to replace some of her paintings at the gallery with new works, and
she's apparently been working on them all day.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I wouldn't try to talk to her, not unless you want your head
bitten off."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>James grimaced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'll take your word for that, though your head still looks
intact."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Fortunately, I had a spare, though I feel like this one's
going to explode.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I can't believe
what that bastard said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Well,
maybe I can believe it, but it still infuriates me to see him dismiss Jane so
casually.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She doesn't deserve
that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah, he was a real jerk for saying it that way, but did
you ever think . . . "<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>James
trailed off with a glance at Jane's door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes?" Daria prompted sharply.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She wasn't in the mood for verbal games or vacillation right
now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I want to talk to you about this," James replied, "but I'd
rather do it outside, in the hall."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Okay," Daria said, puzzled and a bit annoyed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Whatever he's going to say, he
doesn't want Jane to hear it.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once outside their apartment door, James hemmed and hawed
for a few seconds, avoiding Daria's eyes and shifting his weight from foot to
foot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria was about to break in
to this O'Neill-esque display when he finally spoke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, you know that I've never 'gotten' Jane's art," he
began, finally looking her in the eyes, though his voice still had the
slightest hint of a tremor, "and I've always felt a bit guilty about it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've always assumed that <i>I</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> was the one at fault, that there was some flaw in </span><i>my</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> perception that kept me from understanding her
work."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He took a deep breath, and
plowed onward.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"But did it ever
occur to you that this Frank guy might be right?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>That, maybe, the reason I don't understand Jane's art is
because she's just </span><i>not very good</i><span style='font-style:normal'>?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria couldn't believe her ears.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Here was this man, her good friend for almost three years
(with a few interruptions), taking the side of a man who had hurt her other
friend, who was his friend as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>How could he just dismiss Jane like that?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I can't believe you just said that," she said, incredulity
making her voice rise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"How can
you say that?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane's your friend."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, and I think she's a really great person," he replied,
"but that doesn't mean that I have to think she's a great artist.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They're not one and the same."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's not that simple," Daria said, hoping she could get
James to understand the ramifications to Jane of what he had just said.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"You can't separate the two out like
that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane's art isn't just
something she does; it's part of who she is.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Rejecting it is like rejecting her."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I knew this would happen," James said, halfway to himself,
his voice rough with frustration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"It's so typical of you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You can't take any criticism of Jane, even when you know it's not
personal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Don't you think that's
pretty condescending of you, Daria, assuming that Jane can't handle knowing
that a friend of hers doesn't think she's this great <i>artiste</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
waved his hand in the air for emphasis.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm not saying that Jane can't handle it," Daria replied,
her anger now shifting fully onto James.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"But I've seen how the harsh words of a man she admired hurt her.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't want you to hurt her too."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, I shouldn't have to be her fan to be her friend!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"If you are her friend, you will respect her art because it
is a part of her, if for no other reason.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And you won't jump to the conclusion that she's a bad artist based on
the word of a single self-important jerk."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She stepped back, trying to get control of her raging,
confused emotions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She didn't want
to be angry at James, no matter how wrong he was, but he wasn't giving her any
reasons to calm down, either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Oh,
you don't understand."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That was
the only thing she could think of to calm herself down.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, she said it aloud.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What the hell is that supposed to mean?"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>James finally lost his own cool.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Do you think that, just because I'm
not a creative person myself, that I can't understand your high-and-mighty
world?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For that matter, when was
the last time you were creative?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When was the last time you wrote anything that wasn't for some class
assignment or another?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's been
over a year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You haven't even
written any more of those ridiculous Melody Powers stories, and it's not like
those took some great reserve of creative talent!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It took a few seconds for Daria to respond, so unexpected
was this last salvo.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You . . . you told me you liked those stories," was all she

<p class=MsoNormal>The sound of a power drill running across the hall pulled
Daria out of a shallow and troubled sleep.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Groggy, she rolled over and strained to focus her eyes on
the oversized illuminated numbers of the digital clock beside her bed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It took a couple of moments before her
softened brain processed the meaning of the clock's readout.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>It's past four in the morning!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I can't believe Jane would get up this
early.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Has she stayed up all
night?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her light was still on when
I went to bed.</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The drill started whirring at an even higher pitch, becoming
even more effective at penetrating the doors between them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>Why is she even working on a sculpture?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I thought that gallery only took
paintings.</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Normally, she would get up and complain - normally, there
would be no need, since Jane was good about not disturbing her sleep - but if
this was what Jane needed to work through her anger, Daria decided that she
would let it go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This time.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>There's only so much sleep I
can lose.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Getting back to sleep was pretty much out of the question,
but the bed was still comfortable and cozy, so Daria just lay there, eyes
closed and body motionless, but still awake.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She couldn't remember her dreams, and she had a feeling that
she should be glad of that, but her mind still felt unsettled.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>James's words, the ones that had been
the final straw in his earlier argument with her, echoed through her head.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>When was the last time you were
creative?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When was the last time
you wrote anything that wasn't for some class assignment or another?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's been over a year.</i><span
style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
horrible thing was, he was right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>About that, at least.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
hadn't produced a single original work in over a year, something that just a
few years ago would have been unthinkable.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She just hadn't felt like writing.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>At first, she had justified it to herself by saying that she
was busy, that her assignments were taking up all her time and energy, and that
she would get back to writing again when the workload let up.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But even then, she had known, deep
down, that wasn't true; if she had enough time to watch </span><i>Sick, Sad
World</i><span style='font-style:normal'> marathons, she had enough time to
write.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But she had deluded herself
enough to not feel too bad about the loss.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And, eventually, even the need to fool herself had faded,
and writing didn't even enter her head, except as a fleeting thought every now
and then.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A flicker of an idea
that she might feel like sitting down and creating again someday.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But that "someday" was always far in
the future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because, in the
present, she just didn't feel like it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What she did feel was trapped.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Trapped by her chosen profession, by her Journalism
major.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Every day, she worked to
learn how to tell other people's stories, how to accurately convey other
people's ideas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Every day, she
learned how to write, but never how to create.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And she hated it; she hated it fervently.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had for some time, but she had
refused to admit it to herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And as she had worked on those assignments, as writing became more of a
chore for her instead of a pleasure, she had less and less of a desire to
create her own work, to write for herself.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>School had simply leached that desire away from her, so
slowly and subtly that she had never noticed it going.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now, all that was left was a hole where
her love of writing, her creative heart, had once been.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And she could feel the rest of her being
slowly sucked in to that void.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>But I was creative once</i><span style='font-style:normal'>,
she thought, almost desperately.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She forced herself out of bed and over to her desk, shuffling through
one of the drawers until she found what she was looking for.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A plain, spiral-bound notebook, several
years old, its age betrayed by frayed edges and bent corners.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Inside it were pages and pages of her
old Melody Powers stories, the spy satires she had been writing since high
school, that she had once been so proud of.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>So proud of that she had showed them to James shortly after
they had met.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>He said
that he enjoyed them, that they were a lot of fun</i><span style='font-style:
normal'>, she thought bitterly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She opened the first page, and began to read.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By the time she had finished, the sun was starting to cast
its glow over the pre-dawn sky outside her window.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She didn't notice, though, as she had come to one unavoidable
conclusion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The stories were
ridiculous.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She could detect
improvements over time, of course, but even the installments she had written
after coming to Raft were nothing but a m&eacute;lange of sex-and-violence
clich&eacute;s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even as satire, they
didn't work; they were too unsubtle, too obviously clever.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She would be ashamed to show these to
anyone now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>But even then, I
knew these weren't my best work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They were just a diversion, something for fun.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She flipped through the pile of papers a bit further, until
she came across something she had put a good deal more time and effort into -
her story for <i>Musings</i><span style='font-style:normal'>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But she couldn't even bring herself to
finish this one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>An

wrote it.</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria sat at their usual Tuesday lunchtime spot, quiet and
alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had shown up more out
of habit than anything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
their argument, she wasn't sure if James was going to come or not, and as far
as she knew, Jane had still not left her room.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria had been giving Jane a wide berth, as per her own
request, but she was starting to doubt if that was the wisest course of
action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It wasn't like Jane to
hole up for so long, and Daria was beginning to worry that this project of hers
was moving beyond a simple desire to put her best foot forward (if in fact it
had ever been so), and into something more disturbing.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The only question was, how long should
she wait before she took some action about it?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And what should that action be, when Jane had already made
it clear she wanted no interruptions?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, for now, she had no one with which to share her meal,
which was just as well, since she wasn't that hungry to begin with.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had come from her morning class,
and her stomach churned just thinking about it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Normally, she didn't mind it, though neither did she love
it, but after her reflections early that morning, she found herself actively
hating it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She could no longer
deny to herself her extreme dissatisfaction with her chosen field, and she had
sat through class resenting her presence there, resenting its very
existence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Which wasn't really the
fault of the class itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Had she
truly wanted to be a journalist, Daria was certain she would have found it
fascinating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But she wanted to be
a writer, a creator of stories and not just a reporter of them, and as such she
did not belong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her first year at
Raft, she had been a Creative Writing major, and then . . .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But that wasn't even worth thinking about.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had made her choice, and she'd had
her reasons, and here near the end of her junior year, it was too late to turn
back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She would stick it out until
she graduated, and then see what happened.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But if she did that, would she ever even consider writing
again?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Suddenly, Daria could sense a presence standing next to
her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She looked up in mild
surprise to see James, lunch tray in hand, and a shy smile on his face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hey, Daria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Do
you mind if I join you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Her anger did not come rushing back at seeing him, as she
had feared it would, and she waved him to the seat across from her, relieved to
have the chance to talk this over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Thanks," he said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Sorry for being late, but . . . well, you know . . ."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He dropped his tray onto the table, and
then completely ignored it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I
think you were the one who initiated apologies after our last . . .
disagreement, so I guess it's my turn," he continued as he settled into the
seat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm glad you showed up," Daria said.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I have some things I want to say to
you, too."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Okay, but me first."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Far be it from me to rob you of the moral high ground,"
Daria replied with a small twitch of her lips.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"Go ahead and be the bigger man."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Thanks, I think."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>James paused, unsure of how to start.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"Well, I have a couple of things to discuss, actually.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Um . . . I suppose I should say
something about Jane, first.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
still think that I can be friends with Jane without thinking that she's a good
artist, and I know you disagree, but don't you think that should be Jane's
call?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Absolutely."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What?" James said, obviously not expecting such rapid
agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"James, I'm not unreasonable.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Well, not usually, anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I was angry at Frank Cardonelli yesterday, and you just got
in the middle of that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I still
stand by what I said, but not the <i>way</i><span style='font-style:normal'> I
said it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I doubt that you can be a
good friend to Jane without accepting her art, not because I think that Jane
won't let you, but because Jane's art is so much a part of who she is that to
disparage it is to disparage her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I don't see how you can be friends with that much of a disconnect
between you."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She sighed in
resignation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"But, I know you
really like her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And if anyone
deserves the chance to prove me wrong in this, it's you."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Thanks for the permission," he said, only partly
sarcastically.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"That really means
a lot to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But what really
concerns me is this: can you and I be friends if I don't think Jane is a great
artist?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a pause as Daria seriously considered the
question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She knew this was
important, that this issue - however simple it appeared on the surface - was
going to be much trickier than it sounded.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><i>How do I really feel about that?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How do I feel about someone who has a
different, if not maybe lower, opinion of Jane than I?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Where do my loyalties lie here?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Where should they lie?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The moment stretched on, and James began to chew on the
inside of his cheek, while Daria sat in contemplation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"We can," she finally said.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"I know you mean no insult to her, no matter what your
opinions about her art.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But if it
ever does come down to a choice between you and her - "<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>James held up a hand to stop her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Please, Daria, don't," he said, his voice slightly
strained.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I know what you're
going to say, and I understand it, but I really don't want to hear it out
loud."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two of them were quiet for a moment, by some tacit
agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria hoped she was
wrong, that this wouldn't come back to haunt her later.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She'd been caught between two people
before, two people who both meant something important to her, though in
different ways, and she never wanted to go through that again.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, James broke the silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That's one thing out of the way, I suppose.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But it wasn't really an apology, so I
think the floor is still mine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria, I'm sorry I lost my temper with the whole 'you don't understand'
thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I know you didn't mean it
the way I took it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Did you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria shook her head, curious as to where he was going with
this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah, of course not," James continued.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"You're not that much of a jerk."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He grinned.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"You would think that, after all this time with the two of
you, I would have developed a thicker skin.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I suppose I'm just living up to this."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He grabbed a forelock of his red
hair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"But you hit me in a
sensitive spot, even though you didn't mean to.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I've always loved art in all its forms - literature, music,
painting, and all of that - but I've never been able to create <i>anything.</i><span
style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I try
and try, and nothing comes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I hate
that; I feel like there's some part of life that I'm missing, and I'm something
less than a whole person because of it."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"James," Daria broke in, "being able to create is a great
thing, I won't deny that, but it's not everything.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>You have plenty of your own gifts; it's not like you're a
football player or anything."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>James chuckled, but the smile quickly lost out to a somber expression.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I know that, and I value the things that I can do, but the
joy of creation is only part of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I'm a Political Science major.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Tell me, how many political scientists can you name off the top of your
head?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How many from a century

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, and what do they all have in common?<span

as likely to read in an English class as a Poli Sci one."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"James, you love Political Science.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How many times have you shown up here,
tripping over your own words in your eagerness to talk about some discussion
you just had in class?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We've spent
hours discussing the issues you've brought up.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We've gone all night before.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The only time I've ever fallen asleep in class was because
you kept me up too late discussing Plato's ideas on democracy versus a benevolent
dictatorship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm not
complaining.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I wouldn't have done
it if I didn't enjoy it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And you
certainly did."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria couldn't
help feeling a stab of envy at the memories of James's enthusiasm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"More than you, probably.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I wouldn't trade our discussions for anything.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But there's something all my love of
the subject can't give me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria,

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah, that's the one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>'Shall I compare thee to a summer's day', and so on.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You'd think a Shakespeare aficionado
like myself could come up with a more obscure quote, but this one fits what I'm
saying perfectly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So long as his
art endures, he endures."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Actually, what he was saying was that the subject of his
art would live forever," Daria pointed out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"But surely that implies that the author survives as well,"
James replied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"In fact, doesn't
the creator gain more immortality than the subject?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We don't even know for certain who Shakespeare was writing
about, but we know about him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
a century from now, no one will care about what I do; no one's going to be
quoting me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria sighed inwardly, not certain of how to deal with this,
and not sure she could help her friend when her own artistic world was in
turmoil.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Either friend.<span

honesty, which is what she was best at anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"James, art doesn't ensure anything.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yes, we know about Shakespeare, but how
many of his contemporaries do we know about?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>You could probably count on one hand the number of great
Greek playwrights we know about today, and there were certainly more than that.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There are probably many more great
artists we've forgotten than we know about.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>There are other ways to be remembered, though."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah," James replied, though he hadn't yet given up, "but
is there a better, more satisfying way?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>How do you want to be remembered, Daria?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria the Ripper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It has a certain ring to it," James said with a grin.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"But, seriously, Daria, what do you
want to be remembered for?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
have to have thought about it, especially since your father's death."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Of course, I would like to be remembered for my work."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Whatever that may be</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"But
that might not happen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And since
you brought up my dad, I don't remember him for his work.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I remember him for who he was, good and
bad, for the effect he had on my life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I remember him for loving me, even if he didn't always know how to
express it in a normal, sane way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I remember him for being there for me as best as he knew how.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And he didn't have to create a single
piece of art to do it."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That's surprisingly sentimental of you, Daria."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"But you completely skirted the issue."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Because I don't have any easy answers for you."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria suddenly felt very tired.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I could say something like 'your
friendships and relationships are your art'.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I could claim that your creations are the way you impact the
lives of those around you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I could
even say that's just as valid a form of art as writing or music or painting or
whatever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But all that's total
bullshit, and both of us know it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You're right, you don't have much talent for creation, and nothing I say
is going to change that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So I can
only see two options for you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"And those are?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"For one, you can work the rest of your life trying to
create, and either get better or really frustrated."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Trust me, Daria, it would be the latter.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That's the experience of twenty-one
years talking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What's the second?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"<i>What</i><span style='font-style:normal'>?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Give it up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Accept that you're not an artist of any sort and learn to live with
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Get your self-worth and
immortality from something else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Find your satisfaction in your love for Political Science.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a few seconds, James just stared at her, eyes wide and
mouth slightly agape.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria knew
that he was trying to control his emotions and answer her calmly.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, he managed to speak again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That's . . . very easy for you to say, Daria.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You succeed at everything you try to
do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've never known you to fail
at anything you set your mind to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Not to dismiss your advice, but I don't think you have the experience at
failure necessary to tell me to just give up."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"James, believe me, I have experienced failure, including
failure in art.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Did I ever tell
you about when I submitted a story to a local literary magazine?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I think you might have mentioned it before," he said after
some thought, "but I don't remember you going into any details."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"To put it shortly, I sent the story in with pretty high
hopes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane didn't think it was my
best work, but Tom was impressed, and I chose to believe him."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'll bet he was," James said with a tight face.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"It's been my experience that
boyfriends don't usually say things that might get them on their girlfriend's
bad side."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria knew that James
didn't like to hear about Tom, for reasons both of them knew but neither ever
mentioned, so instead of challenging his comment, she merely moved on to the
next part of her recounting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"The magazine rejected it, and I was pretty crushed for a
while, but I got over it, with a little help from Dad.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I hadn't really thought much about it
recently, not until last night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
went back and read over it again, and it turns out that they were right to
reject it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It wasn't a mature
work, not at all, though it was probably my best work at the time."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm sorry to hear that, Daria."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, it gets worse, at least from my perspective.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I read over my old Melody Powers
stories as well, and you were right; they are ridiculous.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I look at them now, and I wonder how I
could ever have been so proud of them."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria's eyes dropped to the tabletop before them, and her smile was self-depreciating.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, your early work was a bit immature," James said,
concerned now for his friend instead of himself, "but you've improved
considerably.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The last stories you
wrote were absolutely phenomenal, compelling and exciting.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They would have been accepted by that
magazine, I'm sure."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, I know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
realized that last night as well, after reeling in shock for a while over those
other discoveries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't have
any doubts about my abilities as a writer.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I know I'm good."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"But you stopped writing.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Why?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria felt a headache forming behind her lenses.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She didn't feel much like talking about
this yet, but something told her that she should, that she needed to get this
out to someone, and her only other option was otherwise occupied.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Taking a breath, she launched into her
thoughts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Do you remember why I switched my major from Creative
Writing to Journalism?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You wanted to make a difference, you said."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, that's what I told you and Jane.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That's even what I started telling
myself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But it wasn't true, not
wholly true, at least."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As she
talked, flashback memories raced through her mind, and she felt as though she
was almost reliving the pain and uncertainty.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"It started shortly after my dad died.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His death prompted me to do a lot of
thinking, re-evaluating my life."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah, I remember," James said.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"If it hadn't, I wouldn't be here with you now."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, but that was only part of it."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria's voice was very carefully
level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"After the initial shock
blew over and life started to return to some semblance of normality, I started
to think about other matters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For
the first time in my life, I realized - really understood - that my parents
weren't going to be there forever to catch me if I fell.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had always thought of myself as
independent, but that was because it was safe to be that way.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I knew I had a backup.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As much as my parents got on my nerves,
they would never abandon me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
when I began to seriously think about my parents no longer being in the
picture, I realized that I couldn't think like a kid anymore.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was time for me to grow up a little
more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And the first thing that
entailed was thinking more practically about my future.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even though I loved it, I did not see
Creative Writing as a very practical field of study.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If I was going to pay my bills, I needed something a bit
more dependable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
Journalism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was close enough to
my first choice for me to enjoy it - or so I thought at the time anyway - but
was something that could land me a job much more easily."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her tone turned wry.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Little did I know it would suck out of
me the very thing I hoped to preserve by choosing it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, I'm so sorry," James said quietly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So, you see, James, you're not the only person who's failed
in their art."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, Daria!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>James's voice jumped from quiet empathy to firm determination in a
moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"You can't just give up
like that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You can do something
I've been attempting my whole life without success, and you love it as much as
I would.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I can't let you just give
it up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rage, rage against the
dying of the light!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria, when
was the last time you raged at anything other than me?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Cardonelli.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>That professor who gave me a 'B' because he didn't like the subject of
my paper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That new traffic light
right off-campus that always turns red at just the wrong time . . . "</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Okay, okay, fine, you get angry.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"All my real passion is gone, James.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>School's drained it out of me.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I never really knew how to use it right
anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A few times, I actually
used it to accomplish something, but most of the time, it just went into
sarcasm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Fun, but not a very
useful emotion."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even as she said
it, Daria could feel that it was true.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Her body and soul felt drained and limp, on a much deeper level than
last night or the current situation with Jane could account for.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The only passion she had left was the
passion of habit, of behaving the way she always had because it was the way she
always had.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Was this a chicken and
egg conundrum: had she lost her passion because she had stopped writing, or had
she stopped writing because she had lost her passion?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You told me to give it up," James was saying.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Fine, maybe I should.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But you shouldn't.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I know that spirit is inside of you
somewhere; your loyalty to Jane proves that you still have some real passion
left.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'll take your advice if
you'll take mine - I'll give up worrying about my lack of creativity, if you'll
start using yours and writing again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>What do you say?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He stuck out his hand impulsively, and Daria stared at it
for a while.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Could it really be
as simple as that?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just start to
write again, and everything will be OK?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'll . . . think about it," she responded.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And she would, she knew.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She didn't feel ready yet to commit
herself, but she would not toss aside this simple lifeline without a second
thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But she first had to know
if there was anything left to grab hold of.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I suppose I can accept that, for now."<span

simple apology has turned this complex.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I think I've actually built up an appetite.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal>"Is she still working?" James asked, while picking around at
his food, trying to find something that still appeared appetizing cold.<span

of her room last night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I
don't think she slept at all; she didn't eat supper last night, and as far as I

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane was not in her room, but she had left a legacy
behind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Artwork - paintings and
sculptures - was scattered all around, littering the floor so that Daria and
James could barely walk without causing damage.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria had known Jane to be messy, but never like this, and
never with her art; that she treated with kid gloves.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And, most peculiarly of all, they were all unfinished.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Paintings half-sketched out, sculptures
only partly assembled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It looked
as though she had started each piece, only to become frustrated and toss it
aside to start anew, and then just repeated the same process.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It looked like an artistic junkyard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, my . . . " was all James could say, looking around.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"This isn't good," Daria responded, knowing she was stating
the obvious but not certain what else to say.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What do you think we should do?" James asked.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Should we wait for her?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Should we just leave her alone?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, we can't just let her be anymore," Daria said,
regretting that she had left her alone for so long as it was.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"No matter what she might have said she
wanted, if she's treating her work like this, then she's not dealing with this
on her own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I have to talk to her,
the sooner the better."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Do you know how to find her?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I have an idea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And if I'm wrong, I have a few others as well.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I've got to do something I usually avoid at all costs - move
quickly."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Great!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Let's
go."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>James was moving as fast as
he could towards the exit - which, given the debris, was not all that fast -
when Daria took hold of his arm to stop him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, James," she said firmly.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"Not you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
is something I need to talk about with her alone.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>You'll just . . . get in the way."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>James looked hurt for a moment, then slumped in resigned
agreement, and nodded wordlessly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What you do, do quickly," he said with an ironic grin.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria sat on a lakeside bench in Jamaica Park, watching Jane
Lane run down the path, headed right for her.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane was wearing her headphones, and the bench was set a ways
back from the path, partially hidden by trees, so Daria didn't think Jane had
noticed her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As she watched her
friend, she noticed a difference; Jane's running was usually carefree, almost a
celebration of her vitality, but she didn't look like that today.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Today, her pace and stance looked
weighed down, as though she was running with a heavy pack upon her back.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her face showed no joy in her activity,
just grim determination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane began to pass her by, and Daria stepped out from the
bench, directly into her path.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
smoothly as if she had been expecting her, Jane swerved to miss her, with no
further acknowledgement of her presence; but Daria reached out and took hold of
her shoulder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The shock sent a
jolt through her body, but Jane stopped and removed her headphones, regarding
Daria with a look halfway between annoyance and relief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So, how did you find me?" she asked, panting slightly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"James and I saw your room.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I thought you might have wanted to get away."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Damn, Morgendorffer, you know me too well.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You knew I wanted to get away, and yet
you bug me anyway."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What are friends for?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After a moment, Jane smiled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well," she said, "this 'being alone' thing wasn't really
working out anyway, so I'm glad you showed up."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two of them returned to the bench, sitting in silence
for a little while as Jane regained her breath, and then a little while
longer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria wasn't certain how
to begin, and didn't think that she needed to; now that Jane had accepted her
company, Daria thought it likely that she would start the conversation on her
own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And she was right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I worked for an entire day, Daria," Jane began, her gaze
downcast, her voice unusually subdued.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Almost twenty-four hours straight, with no sleep or food, just
art.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And the longer I worked, the
more I realized that everything I was doing sucked.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't stand to finish a single piece.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They were all awful.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Amateurish, immature, vapid -
everything Frank said about my work, it was all true.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I thought it was bad when I was putting together my
portfolio for BFAC, but that didn't even hold a candle to this.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is this what all my art is like?"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane turned her face towards Daria, and
Daria didn't think she had ever seen it that frightened.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Daria, maybe I <i>am</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> a fraud, a hack.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe the only reason they thought I was so great in
Lawndale was because I had no real competition, but once I got away from there
and into the real art world, my work just couldn't stand up to any real
critic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria, I'm the Mystik
Spiral of art!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her voice rose to
a shout, and then dropped back down in despair.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"Maybe I should do what Trent did.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Realize that I'm just not going to cut it and pack it all
in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Give up on all of it."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane, is that really what you want to do?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a pause, then Jane shook her head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Trent's
not a very happy person anymore," she said, and there was grief in her tone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Then why worry about what this one guy said? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I've read Frank's reviews.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He knows what he's talking about, and if he trashes my work,
how much of a chance do I have to make it?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"But BFAC let you in, based on your work.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Doesn't that mean anything?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane laughed scornfully and stood up to pace in front of the
bench.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, did you know that something like eighty percent of
BFAC's students go on to become commercial artists?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Commercial</i><span style='font-style:normal'>
artists!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That means sellouts who
can't make it on their own inspiration, so they prostitute their skills to the
highest bidder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That's the kind of
school that took me in, and that's where they expect me to end up.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'll go home and paint houses the rest
of my life before I do that."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
dropped back onto the bench as though her legs just fell out from under her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane, do you paint because art is something you do, or is
art a part of who you are?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Of course it's a part of who I am," she replied, surprised
by the question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"It's always been
the first thing I think about in the morning, and the last thing on my mind at
night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I create automatically,
without even thinking about it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And to lose it would be to rip a part of myself out and stomp it to a
bloody pulp."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Then do what makes you happy, and who cares what the rest
of the world thinks."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That's not good enough for me, Daria.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm not going to do this if I'm not
good at it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, I'm no
different from those Art in the Park people back home, the ones we used to
laugh at.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There's enough bad art
out there in the world that I'm not going to add to it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Whatever happened to art being subjective?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Art is not subjective, Daria.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Yes, there are different tastes, but there is also
definitely such a thing as 'bad art'.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Velvet Elvises, dogs playing poker, crying clowns - these are all bad
art.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And I know my work isn't like
those, but that doesn't make it good."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"OK, I agree.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is definitely bad art and good art.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But I can't point you to some checklist to see where yours
falls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All I can say is I know
that I like your art, that Gary from Gary's Gallery liked your art, as did Ms.
Defoe and a lot of your professors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Don't our opinions mean anything to you over one critic?"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria tried not to sound hurt, but she
had a feeling it leaked out anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, your opinion means a lot to me," Jane said.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"The same way my opinion means a lot to
you when you ask me to read your writings.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But I'm not a trained literary critic, and you probably
wouldn't put my opinion above one of theirs.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>You didn't even place mine above Tom's."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You told me not to!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><i>I don't need this coming back to bite me right now.</i><span
style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"But,
in the end, you were right and he was wrong, even though by any objective
standard, he should have known better than you what a magazine like </span><i>Musings</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> was looking for.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Did it occur to you that, in this case, all of us who like
your art might be right over one art critic who doesn't?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What about Patrick?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He's a real artist, a respected one,
and he thought enough of your work to give you this showing.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And he's not the only respected artist
at BFAC who's liked your work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Your GPA there is higher than mine at Raft because so many of your
instructors have loved your work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Or do you think all of them just want to churn out commercial artists?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, no, of course not."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane's voice was strained, as though she wasn't sure if she
wanted to admit this or not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I'd
never say that about Patrick, or some of my other instructors.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Though there are certainly quite a few
who I'd have no problem saying that about."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Then, if you're still worried about not being any good,
learn from them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You're only a
little more than two years through a four-year program.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You went to college because you didn't
know everything about art, because there were still things to learn.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So you still have almost two years to
learn the difference between good and bad art, and how to make sure yours comes
down on the good side.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
you're finished with that, if you still think your art is no good, then you can
think about doing something else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But it's stupid to stop now, before you're even at the point where
you're supposed to be great."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria's lip curled up at the corner.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"There's still a lot of parties you haven't dragged me to
yet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You can't go back to Lawndale
and leave me here alone."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You wouldn't be completely alone.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"He and I work a lot better when you're around.<span

you turned out."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You really do need me around, don't you,
Morgendorffer?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To Daria's great
relief, Jane was grinning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Y'know, who cares if my work is immature?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm immature, and I still have two more years where I'm
allowed to be!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By the time I get
out of here, I'm going to create works that will force Franklin Cardonelli to
eat that review.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'll shove it
down his throat if I have to."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
raised her fist to the sky, one of her old take-on-the-world gestures.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria realized she had really missed
it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Don't be so hard on your old stuff, Jane," Daria told
her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"The paintings I saw in your
room looked fine to me, what I saw of them.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>For that matter, so did the stuff you did when you were
applying to BFAC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Have you ever
thought that, maybe, you don't have the most objective opinion while you're
putting pressure on yourself?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You might be right," Jane said with a shrug.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I might have even put some of the
works that I hated into my BFAC portfolio, but I don't remember for sure."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They sat there quietly for a few moments, enjoying the
afternoon air and the sun reflecting off the lake.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, Daria remembered James, waiting back at the
apartment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>It would be nice to
sit here a while longer, but I shouldn't leave him hanging like that.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He's worried about her too.</i><span
style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
stood up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Going somewhere?" Jane asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm going back home to tell James you're feeling
better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You can go back to your
running, now."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Nah, I think I'll come with you," Jane said, standing.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I've been running enough, I think."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They started to walk back, under the cover of the
newly-grown leaves emerging to signal the end of winter and the rebirth of the
world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The brown foliage of the
year before crumbled under their feet, an ever-present reminder of the death
that came before life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane," Daria said, after they had been walking for a few
minutes, "if your art is a part of who you are, what do you think about people
- not critics, just people - who don't like your art?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You mean, like James?"<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The reply was calm, matter-of-fact, but Daria nearly tripped
in surprise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Only then did Jane
laugh.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You knew?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"How could I not?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>James is a horrible liar, and almost as bad of an actor.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And you aren't much better."<span

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's not all of me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Do you think I like everything about you, Morgendorffer?<span

about me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But we're still
friends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's the same thing with
James and me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But don't worry,
I'll never tell him that he was right and you were wrong."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm going to have to start checking the hallway for bugs."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Or you could speak a little more quietly.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Our walls are cheap, remember?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>James is safe.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unlike old Frank, who will feel my creative
wrath."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A pause.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"God, Daria, whatever happened to me,
that one critic could get under my skin like that?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's school, I think," Daria responded after some
thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"It wears you down,
drains you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Until you worry about
the opinion of art critics instead of real artists."<span style="mso-spacerun:

before she could go on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Until you
report other people's stories instead of creating your own."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane looked at her, studied her pointedly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, it does," Jane said pensively.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria thought about it for a moment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Late that night, after James had left and Jane had gone to
bed to recover from her day-long sleepless marathon, Daria sat at her desk,
flipping through a course catalog.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Jane's joy at deciding that she did not have to give up her art had
stayed with her through the day, sitting in the back of her mind.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>It was like she had been given back
a precious possession she had thought was lost.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Which I suppose is exactly what happened.</i><span
style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
Daria envied her that joy, that passion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She had told Jane they needed to fight against apathy with passion, but
she still wasn't sure how to get hers back.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But she knew she had to, and that need took precedence over
any merely practical matters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So
she was looking through her catalog from back in her freshman year, at the
requirements for a Creative Writing degree.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>There was enough overlap with Journalism that, if she
switched now, she might get out after just one extra semester.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That wasn't so bad; she'd graduate at
the same time as Jane.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But she
couldn't afford to stay much longer than that.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If she switched, that would be it; changing her mind again
would not be an option.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It would
be a risk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Would it be worth it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But she would worry about that in the morning, as she
checked into the precise details of what she would need to do and of what
classes could transfer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For right
now, there was something else she needed to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'>She took the old notepad
out of the desk drawer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There were
still some empty pages in the back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Author's Notes:</b><span style='font-weight:normal'> I'm
very glad to have this fic completed. Its origins were way back in February of
2005 on the PPMB, when a thread in the &quot;Deep Thoughts&quot; forum was
discussing the deepest fears of <i>Daria</i></span> characters. My suggestion
was that one of Jane's was that she might find out she had no talent after all,
that she was just a self-deluded hack; from there, the bare bones of this fic
was born as I thought about just how Jane might deal with this issue, how she
might react if someone whose opinion she respected told her this very thing.
And for about eight months, the fic was stuck there -- I had the idea for the
exhibit, Jane's bad review, and her subsequent frenzy of work and self-doubt;
but I felt like I didn't have enough there for a full story, just the skeleton
of one. It wasn't until October, when I realized that I could use this event to
examine how Daria, Jane, and James all saw their art and creativity, the role
it played in their lives, that the story really began to come together. It
started as a very Jane-centric fic (and that was how I described it whenever
someone started one of those &quot;what are you working on?&quot; threads), but
I suppose the character of Daria is so fascinating to me that almost anything I
work on is going to be drawn at least partially into her orbit. But I'm happy
with the final result, especially since there were many months when I doubted
that this fic would ever be finished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Acknowledgments:</b><span style='font-weight:normal'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>First of all, I would like to thank my
beta-readers: The Angst Guy, Brother Grimace, Steven Galloway, mjane79,
RLobinske, and Scissors MacGillicutty. Their suggestions improved this fic
immensely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition, I have to give a special acknowledgement here
to my best friend, Aaron. The many hours we've spent in conversation about the
nature of art and its role in life were a big part of the inspiration for this
fic, and the talks we had about the fic while I was preparing to write helped
me tremendously in focusing and refining my ideas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A final thanks to the creators of <i>Daria</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Without the fascinating characters they gave us, this story would not
have been possible.</span></p>
