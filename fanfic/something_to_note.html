<p class=MsoNormal><i>Even before I actually meet Daria Morgandorffer I start
thinking about all the questions I cannot ask her.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This is my first major interview and I fear how I will
stumble and die around a pro like her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I know I should not ask about her late husband or other aspects of her
personal life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering how
much they have been mentioned recently in the news I feel close to them, though
I have never met them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That
happens whenever there is this much publicity surrounding a tragic event, even
if it has been eight months ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
hesitate on what she thinks of the demise of</i><span style='font-style:normal'>
Quite Noteworthy</span><i>, the three hour long daily cable/web news program
she was executive producer of until the end of 2030.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>When she shows up that ends up being the first question out
of my mouth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Actually I asked if
she has scene QN recently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ms.
Morgandorffer smiled like the Mona Lisa at this.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She replied </i><span style='font-style:normal'>&#8220;Miss
me?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I know my replacement is
shooting himself in the foot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>From
what I have scene I want to scream and curse, but I usually just turn off the
monitor.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Do you regret leaving QN?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Absolutely not!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Why would I do that?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
always fought with the network.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
would compromise often but many of my ideas got undeservedly trashed and
despite all the changes I brought to the series that really formed what it was
they never seemed to think I could be right about anything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Were you always right?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As close to &#8220;always&#8221; as humanly possible.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Considering that during your eighteen years at QN your
were able to publish nine volumes it does not seem like you needed the extra
time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is this, an inquisition?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Check your facts only seven were actually written during
that period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I also always felt
pressed for time in the worst ways.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I had enough money not to need to deal with that, so I don&#8217;t.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2>By now I am feeling just awful.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I offended a widow and a pillar of modern journalism,
biography.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A heavy influence on
politics and I wonder how to make it all better.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Some how she knows all this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have not done any interviews in a while.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is not the side I am used to being
on anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But remember I am the
boss.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2>She smiles. Some tensions are released and I continue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Do you mind if I ask more about QN?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is that all you are going to ask about?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Probably not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is a safe topic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I understand.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>When you were given the job as producer did you ever think
that you would have to be the co-host too?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>No.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Interesting
story about how I became fill in co-host the first time.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was first a segment producer.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was supposed to bring in stories
about artists and creative personas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This was after the publication of <i>The Official Biography of __</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> and they knew I was friends with Trent Lane so I was
qualified.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also [my daughter]
Sherilyn was four and Paul [Garibaldi, (her father)] and I had just broken up
so we were always busy trying to decide where who she was going to be taken
care of.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To add to this we were
all new in D.C.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Obviously the
flexible hours were attractive to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>So I had done a story on the </span><i>Embarked ZAP-ducks</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
big news and very controversial.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
had even gotten an interview with one of the key players, Blake Yoba.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>George Drew, the co-host who was
supposed to do the interview claimed to be made physically ill by the presence
of Blake, so I had to do the interview live.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Sherilyn was in the studio with me that day so if you look
at the tapes of it Blake and I keep on making funny happy faces because we were
trying to make her happy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>People
liked that so it became a given that if no one else would do the interview I
would.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>How did you become executive producer?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, we were an increasingly interactive show.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The live web commentary thing was new
and after some disasters the network realized it would have to be edited
heavily and I was good at that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Eventually I began shouldering more of the responsibilities of the
series responsibilities, so they promoted me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>They edit the web comments?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If they did not you would not be able to read any and many
would be inappropriate to air.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>But it&#8217;s cable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And we would lose some of the regular guests if they knew
some of the nasty comments said about them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Were there a lot of nasty comments?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They are public figures and everyone has an opinion.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I think I know what your next question
is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Really?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What
do you think it is?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why did I go to the Atomm trials in Geneva.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2>For those of you who do not know, that is where she and
her husband met, and according to some reports, got married.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was not my next question, but I
would have loved to ask it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I won&#8217;t answer it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Will you discuss anything about your husband?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our sons, Jacques and Sabastian, found some 1960&#8217;s
rock albums translated into German that he owned and we have been having fun
listening to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Any Beatles?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Are you
asking because of how I have been loosely compared to Yoko Ono?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Yes, and how do you feel about it?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is great, only I am not a conceptual artist and I never
did anything like break up the Beatles&#8230;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We did get some comparisons before he died as he was more of
the stay at home parent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As far as
famed widows to be compared to she is not bad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Why are you giving this interview?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is the fifteen-year anniversary of <i>Official Biography</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> and I really hate the way I keep hearing about how
withdrawn I have been.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sure I
don&#8217;t work and QN any more but I have been writing a lot and I have scene
my close friends and family daily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, I am not one for writing my own personal announcements.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>What about meeting new people?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hey, I&#8217;m here with you.</p>

<h1>So what is your new work about?</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a biography of Gertrude Stein in the works.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a conceptual follow up to the
Jean Rhys biography.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I am also
trying to do a semi-fictionalized retelling of the work of Watson and
Crick.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is some more, but
that I would rather not go into.</p>

<h1>You are the boss?</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just remember that.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2>Days after completing the interview I am busy editing
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is hard to believe how long
it took get any of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I try to
make it seem like I had more control over the situation than I did.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I fear that it sounds like we were
already close friends who knew each others thoughts.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>During the interview she could tell how new I am at my job,
and I did not want to sound that bad in the actual article.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I called her and told her this.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style='font-style:normal'>&#8220;You
are definitely becoming a professional.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Just keep things in context and I won&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</span><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some how this did ease my fears.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What she said about being the boss of the
interview is still true. No one can control it like she.</p>
