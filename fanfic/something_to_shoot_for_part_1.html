<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody><i>Author’s Note: </i></span><i><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>A <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> fan had been upset over
a school shooting in his area and asked that a <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> <span
class=SpellE>fanfic</span> be created in which <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
overcomes (or at least deals with) a school shooting, and I was inspired to
craft the <span class=SpellE>fic</span> you see before you now....and I think
it’s different from any other school shooting story I’ve seen, too. There will
be more expansive notes when I finish. But I want one thing understood before
you start reading my story: </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>This is a story in the <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>-verse,
where every sacred cow is in danger of becoming hamburger. This also includes
references (and, in Part III, characters) from *Beavis &amp; Butt-head Do
America*, which <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> had a cameo role in as the BATF
tore up her classroom and assaulted her teacher in front of her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>This is a story about how <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
and friends would try to keep their heads above water in a <span class=SpellE>majorly</span>
screwed-up society. <span class=GramE>Particularly if they ever found
themselves as chess pieces in a plot as Byzantine as this one.</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>This is NOT meant as a story to sermonize on the gun debate.
The background issues of victim disarmament/gun control (pick your preferred
catchphrase there) aren’t what this story is about. But the screwed-up
politicking (and <span class=SpellE>poli</span>-tricking) and deal making
behind it all are part of the story. The &quot;debates&quot; are also a way of
showing character development, as <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> is forced to
deal with a lot of guilt and others deal with their ingrained prejudices (and
their own feelings of guilt), for and against the use of guns. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>I’ve noticed that people with strong feelings on this
subject have automatically assumed that I favor whichever side they oppose.
This isn’t necessarily true, for if you look at it with a little less passion,
you’ll see I don’t put either side (or even <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
herself) on a pedestal. Perhaps I should say it’s a story about human nature
more than it is about the Great American Gun Debate. </span><br>
<br>

<span class=postbody>03/14/01, 8:30 A.M., Wednesday </span><br>
<span class=postbody>--------------------------------------------- </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I can’t believe Ms. Li had the gall to look through our
things,” said Sandi testily. “We, the esteemed members of The Fashion Club.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I <span class=SpellE>knoooowwww</span>,” said Tiffany. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Stacy piped in with, “I can’t believe she took your nail
file, Quinn!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I know,” said Quinn in shocked disgust, “I guess I’ll
have to start using an emery board.” <i>What a bad way for the day to start</i>,
she thought in annoyance. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Quinn,” said Matthew’s voice from a distance, but
sounding urgent. <span class=GramE>Again.</span> Quinn frowned, forgetting all
about her nail file. “Quinn,” he said again, urgently, “We need to talk about
your mom. She’s trying to get a restraining order against me!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>Quinn half-sighed, half-growled.</span></span><span
class=postbody> “Matthew, stay away from me!” She should be terrified or
enraged to see him again so soon, but most of her feelings seemed to go away
when she heard his voice. All she knew was she wanted him gone. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Matthew approached and spoke with more force. “Quinn, we
need to talk NOW. It’s urgent.” Quinn looked away. His curly brown hair, his
green <span class=GramE>eyes, that</span> so many of the girls drooled over had
never really been that attractive to Quinn, although she’d pretended interest.
Now she just wanted him to leave her alone. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Quinn,” said Sandi with annoyance, “he needs to stop
interrupting Fashion Club business. Maybe you should give up your Vice
Presidential duties if you can’t curb him better than that.” She glared, but
softened slightly when she looked again at Quinn’s swollen cheek, now covered
with makeup, where Matthew had hit her just two days ago. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Matthew, who heard every word and knew he was being
ignored, grew furious. “CURB me? You’re the stupid bitch, you...” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Young man!” shouted Ms. Li. “I will not tolerate that
attitude in the halls of <st2:City w:st="on"><st2:place w:st="on">Lawndale</st2:place></st2:City>
High.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“This doesn’t concern you,” Matthew said in an icy tone. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. Li blinked at such a flagrant lack of respect for
authority. Then she looked at Quinn and back at Matthew and her eyes narrowed.
Turning back to Quinn, she asked, “Is this Matthew Foster?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn nodded cautiously. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Don’t worry, Ms. <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>,
I just got a copy of the restraining order and will be changing his locker
number, along with transferring him out of any classes that you share.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“What!?” Matthew sounded furious, but now he glared at Ms.
Li. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn smiled her thanks tremulously. Then Matthew looked
back at her and slowly smiled in a way she never seen before. A chill traveled
down her spine. “Let’s go,” said Quinn softly. Sandi snorted in agreement, and
they continued walking into the bowels of Lawndale High. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn tuned out the Fashion Club as she heard Ms. Li tell
Matthew, “I believe you have a long absence to explain, young man; maybe I’ll
just expel you. In any case, you will remain with me until I can get you square
with the restraining order against you in my office.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Matthew grunted, “I’m not bound by your rules.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. Li exclaimed loudly enough for Quinn to clearly hear,
“You will follow the rules like all other students! And like all other
students, you will allow me to look through your backpack for drugs, weapons,
cartoons demoralizing to Lawndale High, and other contraband on this safe
morning.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>And then their voices began to melt too much for her to
understand them, but only for a moment. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“What in the name of God!?” shouted Ms. Li. Quinn spun
around, and the Fashion Club turned their heads, to see Matthew with a large
barrel gun pointed at Ms. Li. Then they heard deafening reports that turned
their everyday world into something surreal. Like magic, each report was
matched by another bleeding wound in Ms. Li. Ms. Li was on the ground trying to
crawl away. A cloud of smoke seemed to magically appear around the gun. Quinn’s
ears rang with the reports, and nearly all other noise had stopped. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Have fun, bitch,” said a leering Matthew who seemed to be
enjoying his adrenaline, “you’ll die far too quickly for my tastes!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Then the screaming and running began. Quinn was bumped
hard enough to drop her books by someone running past her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“<span class=SpellE>Ohmigod</span>, run Quinn!” shouted
Stacy. Sandi had already taken off. Quinn stared mesmerized. All time had
slowed, and yet so had she. She could not move. This was really happening. But
it couldn’t be. This had to be a nightmare. Yes, a nightmare. Who wouldn’t have
nightmares after Matthew had made all those horrible threats to her and <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> over the last two weeks? And why couldn’t he leave
her alone? Didn’t she make it clear, several <span class=GramE>times,</span>
she NEVER wanted to see him again? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He advanced on her, gun pointed at the floor, a trickle of
smoke maybe coming out of the barrel. Quinn wasn’t sure if this was real or
not. She desperately hoped it was not. But the smell of smoke and gun oil
seemed to mock her hopes. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The maniacal gleam in his eyes said there was no reasoning
with him, no manipulating him, no way to even predict anything other than he
WOULD kill her as soon as he raised the gun.... and he would raise it the
moment she made a move to escape. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Surprised there’s more to me than the family cabin,
Quinn? Yeah, there’s a lot of OTHER stuff I have that you can now enjoy!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“QUINNN!!!” shouted Sandi from a distance. Quinn was the
only Fashion Club member still there, staring at Matthew like a rabbit staring
at an oncoming car. She knew there was no one to save her this time. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Suddenly, there was a primal yell. <span class=GramE>Jodie’s
shrill shriek that sounded just as primal, “MACK, NO!!!!”</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Matthew turned and quickly raised the gun at a charging,
yelling Mack and squeezed the trigger. Blood splattered from a little below his
shoulder, and began dripping down his jersey. He staggered, but he showed no
pain, and it looked as if he <span class=GramE>were</span> going to rush him
again, but Jodie leaped on his back. “MACK, STOP!!!!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn’s paralysis was broken. Without a sound, she turned
and ran. But she heard two reports, and knew he was shooting at her. She heard
his heavy breathing and loud footsteps hurrying to catch up. The halls were now
empty, but she noticed a few people hiding in classrooms and thought to hide in
one, but knew he would hunt her down in any of them. She was the main target of
his wrath. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Suddenly, another report, and the wall almost directly in
front of her splintered, and left a noticeable hole. She knew she shouldn’t,
but she did it before she could stop herself. She fell, rolling on the ground. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Facing towards Matthew now, she saw he could run very
fast. He stopped only a meter away, breathing hard, and pointed the gun down at
Quinn. A drop of sweat flowed past one crazed eye. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>It was obvious he wasn’t going to say anything this time.
She thought she could see the bullet in the barrel that was aimed at her on the
floor on her hands and knees. When he fired, she was going to get it in the
face. She didn’t even know she was groaning. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Three loud reports and Quinn shrieked short and loud and
started shaking and crying.... but she was unhurt. She vaguely noticed that he
jerked his gun up some and pulled the trigger, missing her by a wide margin.
She still flinched. But Matthew looked confused, as if he couldn’t figure out
why Quinn was still alive. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Then he dropped to his own knees, pointing the gun at the
floor again. Then the gun fell from his limp hand and he <span class=GramE>fell</span>
face down. Quinn could see there was blood in his hair. And there, only a few
meters behind him, stood <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>
holding another gun in a 2-handed grip, with her usual emotionless face. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> kept the gun pointed at him, as Matthew lay bleeding. After a
minute (so it seemed--it felt like a day), <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
dropped to her knees, ejected the <span class=SpellE>mag</span> from her gun,
made sure the chamber was empty, and set it down beside her. Then she covered
her face in her arms and sobbed. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>It took Quinn awhile to realize that Matthew wasn’t
getting up, and that Matthew was never going to hurt her again. She got up
shakily and walked unsteadily over to <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, bent
down and hugged her. She did not care if anyone saw. She had forgotten the rest
of the world existed. For a few brief moments, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
and Quinn were sisters who loved each other, not a social outcast and a
popularity achiever that avoided each other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<br>
<span class=postbody>--------------------------------------- </span><br>
<span class=postbody>03/14/01, 8:40 A.M., Wednesday </span><br>
<span class=postbody>---------------------------------------- </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>?” It was Jane, returning <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> to the present. She was holding onto Quinn who was
sobbing on her shoulder. She didn’t let go. “What?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane was worried to begin with, but that casual question
really bothered her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Everyone is outside already,” said Jane, “or almost
everyone. We should join them.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>With effort, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> returned
herself to the present and helped a crying Quinn away from Matthew’s corpse.
(She didn’t check, but something in her gut told her Matthew was dead.) <span
class=GramE>After her short spell, she felt.... well, not better, but more in
control.</span> She could think again, which is something she really needed to
do. They walked a little behind Jane, Quinn continuing to hold onto <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>, who returned the hold. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane, Quinn and <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> came
across Ms. Li lying on her back, with Mack and Jodie beside her. Jodie was calm
but crying, and Mack looked exhausted--and bloody. It wasn’t clear how much of
that blood was <span class=GramE>his own,</span> and how much belonged to other
people, like Ms. Li. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn, beginning to regain her awareness of where she was,
just knew she saw him get shot. They had elevated Ms. Li’s feet on cushions
from a couch and put bandages on her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Are you two hurt?” asked Jodie, staring unbelievingly at <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Quinn clutching each other. Quinn was still
crying<span class=GramE>,</span> <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> obviously had
done so, however calm she might be right now. Jodie grimaced as she caught the
swelling on Quinn’s cheek, with just a bit of a bruise showing there. So the
rumors were true. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“We’re fine,” said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
deadpan. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>Yeah, right,</i> Jodie thought. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Is she dead?” asked Quinn. She couldn’t see how Ms. Li
could be otherwise. She saw Matthew shoot her 4 times with that huge gun of
his. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“No,” said Jodie. <span class=GramE>“Weak breath.</span>
But steady. I’m not sure where the nurse is. I grabbed all the bandages, gauze,
and first aid materials I could find. And stupid 9-1-1 was busy!” Jodie’s face
broke. “Oh, god <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, Mack’s been shot.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I’ll be fine,” said Mack, pressing at the side of his
chest, a little under the shoulder. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jodie glared at him through her tears, and then turned
back to Quinn. “How did you get away? And he IS out, right? You sure weren’t
running, and there haven’t been anymore shots. I assume he’s.... stopped.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yeah,” said Quinn weakly. “<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
shot him.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jodie’s head twisted to stare at <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
in open shock. “How did you get his gun away from him?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I had my own gun,” said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
groaning inwardly at her own admission, but suddenly feeling an overwhelming
need to justify what she did. “I’m sorry. But he had threatened us. I knew
restraining orders usually don’t help. It can trigger violence. And he had
already threatened Quinn, and then threatened me when I called the cops. He
left, but I knew he was serious. I could feel it down in my gut. It was a
feeling I never had before, and hope I never will experience again.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane looked as if she thought <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
was crazy to have just divulged that. And so damn casually! </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jodie stared a bit more, and then went back to checking on
Ms. Li. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> knew that most people would not see
what she did as heroic. And as much as she hated to bite the bullet, she
figured she’d better call her mom now. She was tempted to have Quinn make the
call, but Quinn was fighting hysterics. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Quinn, may I borrow your phone?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“It’s in my backpack,” said Quinn weakly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I’ll get it, <span class=SpellE>amiga</span>,” said Jane.
Only a little <span class=GramE>quiver</span> to her voice, but otherwise also
casual. She reached in Quinn’s backpack, and finally found it and pulled it
out. She clicked it on, and after it beeped, she handed it to <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn had an almost vice-like grip on <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.
Luckily, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> just had to hit a button to call her
mom’s office. And after arguing with the secretary with unusual heat, she
finally got her mom on the line. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,” said Helen <span
class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>, “this had better be good!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> felt a slight twinge at wanting to say something brilliant that
would go over her head, but couldn’t find any real inspiration. “Mom, Matthew
brought a gun to school and tried to kill Quinn.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>There was a second of silence before <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
pulled the phone away from her ear a bit. Even Quinn heard a loud, audible,
“What!?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Matthew. He came to school. He shot Ms. Li and Mack. And
he tried to shoot Quinn.” Now for the good part, thought <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,
as her insides twisted almost as bad as when she squeezed the trigger some time
<span class=SpellE>ago.”She’s</span> okay,” said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.
“I prepared for this. It was a good thing. I shot him before he could shoot
Quinn.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> pulled the phone away again as her mom began ranting. “This is
NOT funny in the least, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>!”
That was the first time in years Helen had used her last name, <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> noted grimly. “I want to know what you thought you
would accomplish with this joke besides getting yourself grounded for a month!
And counseling for you!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Mom,” said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> calmly, even
as her heart was beating faster again, “I’m not joking. Would you like to talk
to <span class=GramE>Quinn.</span> She’s right here beside me.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>When no answer came, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
sighed and handed the phone to Quinn. “Here,” she said deadpan, “You tell her
what happened.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn snatched it away and began babbling incoherently,
crying hard again. She repeated herself over and over without making much
sense. <span class=GramE>Finally, “What!?</span> Oh.... okay. Here.” Quinn
sounded almost sullen for some reason, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> thought.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen was crying now, too. But there was more silence in
the background, so Helen must have gone somewhere more private, <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> realized. “<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, you shot
that boy. Please tell me you shot him with his own gun!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“No,” said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, “I was scared
and brought one of my own, knowing he was likely to try something like this.
I’ve been studying stalker cases, you see. I knew that restraining order was
likely to drive him over the edge. So I prepared.” <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
wished she could stop this unexpected need to justify herself from babbling out
like that. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Listen to me very carefully, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,”
said Helen slowly and precisely and with an intensity <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
never heard her mom use before. “That gun belongs to Matthew. He dropped it.
You picked it up and fired it without thinking. You were sure he was going to
kill you both. Do you understand me?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Mom,” said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, &quot;He WAS
going to kill Quinn, and me if he saw me. But there are cameras in the
hallways. It almost certainly got on video. Other people might have seen. And
Jodie and Mack already know the truth.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> decided not to comment on Quinn’s state at the moment. <span
class=GramE>Or her own.</span> Jodie and Mack stared intently at them both now.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,” said Helen imploringly,
“You don’t understand. Even if it were self-defense, you broke federal and
state laws that don't care if your life is in danger. The Gun-Free Zones Act,
the Project Safe Neighborhoods. You are legally an adult. You are looking at
several years of federal prison at least. And that’s not counting the local
charges or the law suit Matthew’s family might bring against you.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“What!?” <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> had expected
something horrible from the legal standpoint, but the last startled her and
outraged her more than anything. <span class=GramE>&quot;Why would his family
sue me!?&quot;</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen sighed. “I’m sorry, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,
but our society prefers to blame everyone and everything but the criminal that
started it. Families have sued those who have stopped a violent criminal
rampage with a gun or other weapon. It happens more often than you know.” Helen
suddenly sounded old. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Icy fury filled <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, but she
suppressed it. “Can you sue his family?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen gasped. “I hadn’t thought of that, <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>, but it’s a thought. I can use it to scare them into
leaving you alone, anyway. But that’s really one of the smaller problems. Even
if I call in every favor I can to get you off, there’s still the federal laws
that I can’t do anything about. Please, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, are
you absolutely sure? Are the police there?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I’m pretty sure. But no, there’s no police. At least not
inside the building.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I’m on my way, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. Please
don’t volunteer any information. Don’t leave the scene of the....” Here Helen
stopped herself. <span class=GramE>Then continued, “Of the incident.</span>
Don’t talk to anyone, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. Don’t let Quinn talk,
either. If any police question you, avail yourself of your right to remain
silent. Except to let them know I will sue their asses off if they take
advantage of Quinn while she’s in the state she’s in!” <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
knew Helen wasn’t bluffing. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Okay,” said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I’m on my way,” said Helen. “I love you.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Love you, too.” Helen hung up, and <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
punched in 9-1-1 with one hand. Busy. “Sorry,” she said to Jodie. “9-1-1 is
still busy.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Thanks for trying,” said Jodie weakly. <span class=GramE>Then
looked up after a moment.</span> “<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,” she said
uncertainly, “If you wanted to claim the gun you used belonged to Matthew,
I’d..... I’d back you.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Me, too,” said Mack decisively. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And me,” said Jane unnecessarily, and a bit of pleading. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> was sorely tempted. She wondered where the film was held for
the hall cams. She wanted to see the angle they got. And were they on cam now?
Did they have audio? Not enough information for <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
to make a choice. She now realized that she hadn't thought this out anywhere as
well as she thought she had. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>A loud click, booted feet.</span></span><span
class=postbody> <span class=GramE>“ON THE FLOOR!</span> <span class=GramE>NOW!”</span>
Time for thinking was over. They all got on the floor as several cops looking
vaguely like heavily armed ninjas were approaching. In some odd way, the cops
seemed as murderous as Matthew. Several cops came up to them, their guns still
drawing beads on them. “Where’s the shooter?” asked one. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“In... in the hall,” said Jodie. “But Mack and Ms. Li here
are hurt. They need an ambulance.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“There’s ambulance outside,” said the cop, before speaking
into a radio on his shoulder. He looked back down on them and said, “They’ll be
in....” several gunshots echoed from down the hallway. Quinn began sobbing
again, and all the others came close. They thought the shooting was over and it
was so LOUD. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The cops lost interest in them and went to the hallways,
taking up point positions. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> heard one of the
cops swear with many words Ms. Li would disapprove of. He shouted something
about, “Next time, make damn sure before you shoot again!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Radio squawks echoed everywhere. More cops came running
in. <span class=GramE>Now some <st2:place w:st="on">EMS</st2:place> workers
were coming in. <br>
<br>
“Over here!” shouted Jodie with a sense of relief that bordered on joy.</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Wait,” said one cop, a different one, if he looked like a
carbon copy of the first one that spoke earlier. “Stay on the floor.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“What!?” asked Jodie. “We’ve got two wounded over here!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Stay calm, miss,” he said professionally and without
feeling. Jodie felt herself beginning to lose it, but bit down on her natural
reaction. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Luckily, more <st2:place w:st="on">EMS</st2:place> came in
a couple of minutes later. Two of them with gurneys came for Ms. Li and Mack.
All of them were escorted outside under police guard (with the stanchions
pulled apart allowing greater access), where a few cameras were already set up
from the local press. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> was amazed by that. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The cops didn’t search any of them, and even with the buzz
of the metal detector from the gurneys and cops going through as well as <span
class=SpellE>Daria's</span> gun hidden in a gun pouch under her shirt, did
anyone stop to think that there might've been another shooter among them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=postbody>--------------------------------------- </span><br>
<span class=postbody>03/14/01, 10:00 A.M., Wednesday </span><br>
<span class=postbody>---------------------------------------- </span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> was sitting in the front seat of her mom’s car, door open, feet
on the curb, watching Quinn and the cops, with Helen hovering over them. She
couldn’t hear what they were saying over the radio she tuned through
listlessly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“.....Police have released no names at this point, but the
shooter was apparently a jilted lover who shot his principal, a boy for being
black, and his girlfriend before taking his own life. We have word that the
principal and black <span class=GramE>student are</span> in critical condition,
while the girl and the shooter are both dead......” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“....Why was this student allowed to have access to guns
anyway? Do we want all our schools to become places where shoot-outs are
common? How many more children have to die<span class=GramE>?....</span>” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“....This is why teachers need to have guns, to prevent
incidents like this from happening. I wouldn’t just make it optional, I’d make
it mandatory......” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria’s</span></span><span
class=postbody> shaking hand kept flipping the tuner on the radio in her mom’s
car. What had happened was all over. So far, no one seemed to know there was
another shooter. The accuracy of the reports themselves <span class=GramE>were</span>
confused, at best. No one knew anything, but it wasn’t stopping people from
acting as if they knew, reporting wild speculations as facts, and exploiting
this situation for whatever pet political agendas they had. It really was a
sick, sad world. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She regretted sending Jane away. But she didn’t want Jane
with her if she got arrested. It would be too easy to arrest her, too. Jane
begged <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> to give her the gun, but <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> refused. If the police didn’t find it on her, they
would go after Jane. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> was amazed at how fast the police and the media showed up in
force. And more kept coming. It was uncanny. She hadn’t thought either of them
could respond with this kind of alacrity. It had taken the cops of Columbine
hours longer to gather and organize the kinds of <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>tac</span></span> teams that swarmed Lawndale High now. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Right now, they were running dogs all through and around
Lawndale High sniffing at everything. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> had to
give them credit for being thorough. She’d heard <st2:City w:st="on"><st2:place
w:st="on">Lawndale</st2:place></st2:City>’s Finest were lazy and incompetent,
but Ms. Li would be pleased to see such speed and apparent efficiency. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen was with Quinn, talking to a few police officers.
They seemed to be questioning Quinn, but Helen was doing most of the talking.
The police seemed confused and annoyed by the defensiveness and protectiveness
of Helen, but seemed willing to put up with it. <span class=GramE>For now.</span>
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“....We said it over and over again folks, that taking God
out of the schools is putting the violence and the drugs and the sex in, for
where there is no God, there is Satan....” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> clicked off the radio. She felt tears well up again, but they
didn’t spill over. She dimly realized she was in some kind of shock, and her
mind was struggling to convince <span class=GramE>her this</span> was all a
dream. She would be strong and remind herself that while this sucked, it was
real. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Several police officers, possibly even a SWAT team with
all their body armor and guns <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> mused, joined
Helen and Quinn and the other officers. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> saw one
black gloved hand holding what looked to be a video tape up to one who was
probably a detective, and her heart raced. Helen slowly turned to look towards <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> and she knew that they knew. Bumps crawled over her
flesh as she fought to maintain her composure. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen turned and said something to them and started
walking towards her. Several tense cops walked behind her, but Helen paid them
no mind. As they got close, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> stepped out of the
car and then chaos broke loose. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>One black-cad arm grabbed Helen and pulled her down to the
ground. Several of the black cad team raised their weapons at her screaming incoherently.
Of the few orders they barked at her that she could make out included, “don’t
move!” and “get on the ground now!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen was also screaming at them in panic to stop and
she’d have their badge among other things. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
couldn’t make much sense out of what was being said, but she suddenly
remembered how trigger happy they were in the school hallways. They were almost
as bad as the BATF had been in her <st2:place w:st="on">Highland</st2:place>
school. It seemed all the faces and cams had turned towards her as she was
being screamed at by this brigade, their weapons trained on her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> put her hands up, figuring that was one of the things they were
yelling. And now only one voice rose above Helen’s for <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
to lay herself on the ground. As <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> knelt down,
she used her hands to balance on the pavement eliciting many more screams of
things like, “Keep your hands where I can see them!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Scared or not, she was finding the police to be rather
annoying. Was everyone in the world this stupid and panicky? They might have a
record response time, but they hardly lived up to their reputations of courage,
intelligence, and cool temperament under fire shown on the silver screen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Another illusion shattered,” <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
mumbled glumly, as she stretched her arms and legs out, lying flat on the asphalt.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She was soon surrounded by several men pointing guns at
her. She fought the temptation to tell them that Lawndale High was a gun free
zone, or “away put your weapons, I mean you no harm.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She felt a hand firmly push down on the small of her back,
just below the belt with her gun pouch. Her right hand was grabbed so firmly as
to hurt, even bending her index finger, and brought behind her back. After they
yanked her other hand back, she found being cuffed can actually hurt. They were
either sadistic, or they were truly afraid of her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>One then sat heavily on the back of her knees and another
officer took off her Doc Martins. The one sitting on her ran his hands down her
back and side. She wondered if that was legal, as they were supposed to have women
to do that, and some were present. The searching officer finally felt the belt
under <span class=SpellE>Daria’s</span> shirt. He pulled her shirt up revealing
the belt. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Hey, watch it!” she said, “<span class=GramE>we’re</span>
not even married.” She was beginning to wonder if she should’ve just shot it
out and be done with it. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The belt finally came off. “Gun!” yelled the searching
officer. They continued the search, and then did it again. Then two helped to
pull her up and one ran a nightstick over her front. Then one from behind used
his hands to search her front more firmly. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
repressed the urge to say her dad would force him to marry her in a shotgun
wedding for fear of them seeing that as a <span class=SpellE>terroristic</span>
threat. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> heard Helen, finally on her feet and brushing herself off, say,
“I am her lawyer, she is availing of herself to be silent....” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“You knew,” said the man <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
assumed to be a DT. “I ought to have you both arrested!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The police finally stopped searching her, but seemed
frustrated. “Give her to Sergeant <span class=SpellE>Lanny</span>,” said one.
“I want her thoroughly searched!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> saw that several cops were going through her mom’s car,
including with a dog. What the hell were they looking for? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> was stopped a short distance from Helen where she was read her
rights. They seemed to be making a point to Helen, but <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
couldn’t make out what it was. Helen looked worried though, and that couldn’t
be a good sign. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen took her eyes off <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> to
turn to the detective. “Detective Warner, your department is using excessive
force! If you don’t....” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>,” said the
detective with a lot of heat, “we have two seriously wounded and a dead body.
If you don’t want to join your daughter in a detention cell with charges of
obstruction of justice and interfering in an investigation, then you’ll let me
do my damn job. We know what we’re doing, and you will be made aware of the
reasons soon enough.” With that, he turned and walked off, audibly cursing. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> was soon out of range to hear anything more. They eventually
came to a car and opened the back door. “Watch your head,” said a monotone
voice as she was put in and the door slammed behind her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Now she could only see Helen, not hear her. Only the
crackle of the police radio made noise in the car. She looked and saw Quinn
looking at her forlornly, crying. <span class=GramE>Her own</span> tears fell
then, and she lost any regret for having saved Quinn’s life, even if the cost
might be her own future. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Then she saw Jane in handcuffs being put into another car.
Damn. Life sucked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>4. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>--------------------------------------- </span><br>
<span class=postbody>03/14/01, 4:20 P.M., Wednesday </span><br>
<span class=postbody>---------------------------------------- </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Hours that felt like days assaulted <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
<span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>, as she was booked in, strip searched
with more zealotry than required, scanned by devices, fingerprinted, pictured. <span
class=GramE>When they finally got through one cop told the detective that had
threatened to arrest her mom that nothing was found on her.</span> He expressed
his cynicism with some expletives and ordered the search done again. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“She’s smart,” he said, pointing at her. “Watch her!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>So she was searched again. Then she was put into a room
with a mirror that she knew was two-way. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> didn’t
understand what was happening. At least she wasn’t put in a suit of some kind,
and she got her Doc Martins back. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>And here she waited hours, still in handcuffs. She hadn’t
had lunch and she was pretty hungry. She also needed a bathroom pretty bad
about now. She called out a few times, but no one responded to her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>As she was finding that she could sleep in her position,
the door came open and two men came in, including the big and swarthy man who
threatened to arrest her mom, and the other one a bit more rounded out with his
hair made slick with some kind of jell. The one who threatened her mom glared
at her as if he hated her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The other one smiled disarmingly as he pulled out a file
and began going through it. He cleared his throat, almost apologetically. “I’m
sorry for the wait, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, but it’s been a zoo. The
press is out for blood. They really want to know who you are. I don’t want to
say anything, especially until I know what’s going on <span class=GramE>myself</span>.”
He looked at <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> who stared at him emotionlessly.
“Just relax, okay? We’re all friends here.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Can I go to the bathroom?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He looked embarrassed. <span class=GramE>“Oh, sure.”</span>
He looked up at the one who was still glaring at her. “Dan,” he said in a lower
voice, “Could you get Sergeant <span class=SpellE>Lanny</span> to escort <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> here to, uh, where she needs to go?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Actually,” said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> a bit
uncomfortable, “I’ve already had the pleasure of meeting Sergeant <span
class=SpellE>Lanny</span>. Can someone else escort me?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The glaring cop called “Dan” smiled at her menacingly. <span
class=GramE>“Your call.</span> But I warn you, Sergeant <span class=SpellE>Lanny</span>
is one of our nicer people.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The other cop got up and talked to him too low for <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> to hear. The cop glared at <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
as he walked to the door and left. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>After he left, the other cop said, “<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,
my name is Glenn Cartwright. I’m pretty much in charge in investigating what
happened at Lawndale High today. My partner is named Dan Warner, also a
detective. Due to another investigation in progress regarding the activities of
Matthew Foster, he has also been assigned to this case. He’s in a really bad
mood and dealing with a lot of hard circumstances that you accidentally caused
to his investigation. But if you answer our questions quickly, I’m sure we can
all go home sooner, and that should put Detective Warner in a better mood.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I can go home?” <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> asked in
a mix of hope and disbelief. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I don’t know,” said Cartwright. “I hope so. I think you
were just scared and did what you thought you had to do to defend yourself.
You’re young, in a bad situation. I have a daughter not much younger than you,
and I know how scary the world can be to young people, and the poor judgment
teens sometimes use without meaning to hurt anyone.” He looked at her as if
asking if she was okay with this. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I’m wondering something,” said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.
When Cartwright made an expression to ask away, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
asked, “I was seen on the video shooting Matthew, so you knew what I looked
like. But how did you know it was me, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, and how
did you know who my mom is to ask her and find out where I was?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Cartwright seemed to blanch. “You’ve never been in trouble
with the law before?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> shook her head. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I don’t know, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, but I
wasn’t there. Warner was, but you don’t want to ask him about that right now.
But I’m sure it will become clear as we look into what happened together.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> didn’t like that answer at all. She had been briefly
interviewed by a female officer two days ago, but all the cop did was get her name
and ask if she saw Matthew hit Quinn or if she had seen a gun. Saying no, the
cop moved on. Almost all the attention had been on Quinn and with Helen. She
didn’t think that was how they recognized her this morning. But she didn’t know
how else to pursue it for the time being. So instead she asked, “How much time
am I looking at?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He tightened his lips, and looked a bit uncomfortable. “I
personally think the most you should get is probation for bad judgment. And you
might have even saved a life, maybe several lives.” He looked at the door
before looking back. “Warner, though,” he made a face, “he thinks anyone who
has a gun has something to hide.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“He must not trust cops much,” <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
replied. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Cartwright chuckled and then turned serious. “Please help
us, and I think we can help you. We know the guy you shot. He has a history of
violence. He had threatened you and your sister before, hadn’t he?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> nodded. Maybe she really had a friend. Warner had threatened
her mom and now he was threatening her. He seemed to really hate her. She shook
her head to clear it of rambling thoughts. “Can you tell me what Matthew was
being investigated for?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Cartwright shook his head in disgust. “I’m sorry, <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>, but that’s privileged information. But I will say if
anyone ever needed killing, it was him. It’s bad to say that, but that’s how I
feel about it. I tell you, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, I think you did us
all a favor, and I want to say thank you. But don’t tell anyone, not even
Detective Warner, or I’ll deny it.” He smiled and winked at her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“What about me?” asked <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>Daria</span></span><span class=GramE>.</span> “And am I going to be
charged with federal crimes?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“What federal crimes would that be?” Cartwright seemed
more curious than anything. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I didn’t violate any by bringing a gun to school?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yeah, you might have. You violated <st2:State w:st="on"><st2:place
w:st="on">Virginia</st2:place></st2:State> law, too, by bringing a gun to
school, but who cares about those laws?” He smiled at her. “But there’s some
discretion on our part, and I’m <span class=SpellE>gonna</span> try to see to
it that you get off. You should get a medal for what you did, not prison. You
saved your sister’s life! I’d have done the same exact thing. But you’ve got to
be absolutely honest with us, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. It doesn’t look
good if you keep things from us.” He looked at her intensely, a look of
fatherly concern and sad eyes on his face to go along with his voice of
paternal concern. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Are these cuffs necessary?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I don’t think so,” <span class=GramE>said</span>
Cartwright, “but Warner insisted. At least until we let you go or put you in a
cell. And the rules are on his side on this.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> doubted that. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Can I, uh, ask you something, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>?”
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> nodded. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Where, um, where did you get that little gun of yours?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>When <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> stared at him, he
waved his hands in a “nothing to worry about here” gesture. “I’m just wondering
because it’s so small, but you took that scumbag out! I’d like to get one for
my wife.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I’m sure any gun store can get you one,&quot; replied <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>. <i>If you're not going to answer my questions, why
should I answer yours?</i> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Detective Cartwright frowned at that, and before anything
else was said, Sergeant <span class=SpellE>Lanny</span> came in and took <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> out and brought her back. When she came back, looking
much calmer, the two detectives were talking in low tones, but very animated.
They both put on the faces she recalled when they looked at her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody>, let go by the chair she had been in, sat back down and stared
at them quietly. They both seemed to dislike that calm expression on her face. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Now <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,” said Cartwright,
“why did you get a gun?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Don’t I get a lawyer?” asked <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Warner laughed. “What did I tell you?” he said to
Cartwright. “These punks think they all know how to work the system.” He turned
to <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and put his hands on the table as he firmly
said with contempt dripping from his voice like acid, “No, kid, this <span
class=SpellE>ain’t</span> TV. You answer our questions, and then you get a
lawyer.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Cartwright motioned for Warner to calm down before turning
back to <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. “<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, we
don’t even know if we’re going to charge you with anything. If there are formal
charges, then yes, you get a lawyer. If you answer our questions without any
trouble or resistance, I’m sure you’ll be home in time for supper.” <span
class=SpellE>Daria’s</span> stomach rumbled at the mere mention of supper. He
shrugged nonchalantly at her. “You saved your sister’s life. It’s not like you
got anything to hide, do you?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> looked towards the mirror behind the two detectives. She
recalled her mother saying something about a “gun free zone act” and “project
safe neighborhoods,” both being federal statutes. “I want a lawyer,” she said
again and more firmly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,” Detective Cartwright
said pleadingly, “even if we let you go, we have paperwork to fill out. Let’s
not be hostile about this. Just tell us enough to fill out our paperwork and
we’ll probably let you go.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Detective Warner got up and approached the silent <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>. He stared down at her with his arms crossed. “Tell
us what you were doing at the Zen on March 2nd and I’ll help you get a lawyer,”
he said. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>Cold.</span></span><span class=postbody>
<span class=SpellE>Daria</span> tried not to sweat, but she could feel the
moisture building, and yet she felt cold. How much did they know? She took an
unsteady breath and repeated, “I want a lawyer.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Detective Warner’s eyes bore into <span class=SpellE>Daria’s</span>
as he said in a low voice, “Maybe the <span class=SpellE>Sloanes</span> will
get you a lawyer.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> blinked at that with genuine confusion. “Why would they do
that?” She blurted that out before she could stop herself. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Detective Warner walked to where he was standing directly
behind <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. He rested his dark hands on her
shoulders while he continued to stare at her eyes, using the mirror to do so.
“What did you talk to Matthew about at the Zen?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria’s</span></span><span
class=postbody> face hardened. “I want a lawyer.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“GODDAMMIT!!!” shouted Warner from behind her causing her
to squeeze her eyes shut instinctively for several moments, “You and Jane both
plotted to kill that kid, didn’t you! I bet you thought he had killed your
sister before you shot him! You set him up but killed him before he did his
job!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria’s</span></span><span
class=postbody> face flushed with heat. “Jane had nothing to do with it!” said <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>. “I don’t know why she didn’t run when I did what I did,
but she doesn’t know anything!” She was close to babbling and she quickly got
hold of herself. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Patting <span class=SpellE>Daria’s</span> shoulder a
couple of times, Detective Warner started to casually walk back to his chair on
the other side of the table “Oh, that’s very touching,” said Warner with such
sarcasm as to impress even <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. “But your friend
already told us everything, including how you hated your sister. Who do you
think we’ve been talking to all this time? <span class=GramE>You stupid kids.</span>
You can never keep a secret. She already told us how you plotted to kill him
after you used him to kill Quinn, told us about your disagreement with Matthew
at the Zen, and that you threatened to kill her if she said anything.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> didn’t know how they knew about the incident at the Zen, but
she couldn’t trace any of what happened there with the other questions. They
must be lying. She shook her head no in denial of their words. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I’m sorry, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,” said
Detective Cartwright regretfully, “but <st2:Street w:st="on"><st2:address
w:st="on">Jane Lane</st2:address></st2:Street> is <st2:Street w:st="on"><st2:address
w:st="on">Jane Lane</st2:address></st2:Street>’s best friend. I don’t believe
her myself. I think that there might have been some drugs involved, though that
doesn’t cancel out that you saved your sister’s life. Why don’t you tell us
your side before <st2:Street w:st="on"><st2:address w:st="on">Ms. Lane</st2:address></st2:Street>’s
testimony becomes the only testimony heard in court?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> grew furious. The lying bastards had real practice at sounding
like they were telling the truth. But she said nothing, merely making a mental
note never to play poker with them. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Warner grew calm and sat down, smiling as if he knew a
very nasty secret that <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> was not going to like.
“If you stay silent, Jane will get off, but you’ll never see the outside of a
prison cell until you’re collecting social security. Don’t you think Jane
should grow old with you?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Liar,” <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> gritted out. Both
detectives actually looked as if they had been slapped. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“You don’t think we want to help?” asked Cartwright,
looking wounded. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> just stared at him deadpan until even Cartwright began to feel
a chill. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Believe what you want,” said Detective Warner, “but <st2:Street
w:st="on"><st2:address w:st="on">Jane Lane</st2:address></st2:Street> has
already agreed to testify against you in exchange for dropping all charges
against her. If nothing else, we got you, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> <span
class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>, lock, stock and barrel.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She knew they were lying, but she couldn’t help breaking
into tears again. Mainly because she knew that Jane was going through
everything she was going through, too. <span class=GramE>All because of her.</span>
They were telling Jane that <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> was putting all the
blame on her. She hoped Jane knew better, just as <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
knew better. “I want a lawyer,” she said again, this time her voice shaking and
her tears falling free. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“YOU <span class=GramE>DON’T</span> GET A LAWYER!” shouted
Warner, slamming his fists on the table, startling <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.
She hated the cuffs on her wrists as she felt an overwhelming need to be able
to block against blows. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Cartwright grabbed at Warner to calm him down and whisper
in his ear, but Warner continued with, “And a lawyer won’t do you any good.
Video doesn’t <span class=GramE>lie</span>, kid.” He let himself be calmed by
Cartwright then. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Cartwright turned back to <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.
“I know this is very uncomfortable for you. Heck, we want to go home just as
badly as you do, but we can’t until we get the paperwork on this finished. And
we can’t do that,” he said pleadingly, “until you answer only a few simple
questions. We just want to understand what’s going on here, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.”
He shrugged and added, “Even if we do charge you with anything, you can be
bailed out and sleep in your own bed tonight. <span class=GramE>How’s that?”</span>
When <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> just stared silently at the mirror,
Cartwright added, “It’s not like you have anything to hide, is it?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I want a lawyer,” said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,
shaking still but calming down as her resolve strengthened. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Okay, kid,” said Cartwright. “We’ll do this the hard way
if you insist. It’s a hard row. You don’t want to know about the kind of places
you’ll be sent to for holding if you insist on this.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“We got 48 hours before we have to let you go, assuming we
don’t charge you with a crime,” smiled Warner, making it clear that she was
going to be charged. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> had no idea how much time
had already passed, or when the counting officially began. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“You sure?” asked Cartwright, looking at <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> with concern. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody>, firmly resolved, just stared silently into the mirror. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Okay, then. Just so you know, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,”
said Cartwright, “You’re being charged with first degree murder, conspiracy to
commit murder, illegal possession of a firearm, and bringing a weapon onto
school grounds. The DA and the city attorney are looking into other charges at
this time, and there’s an on-going investigation that may bring up more
charges. The BATF have also been notified, and they will be issuing gun-related
charges. Now we’ll get you your lawyer.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Warner looked at Cartwright. “What about the other one?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Jane?” asked Cartwright. “She’ll get her immunity in
exchange for testifying against <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“No,” said Warner, “Right now? Nearly everyone has gone
home for the day. We’re about all that’s left. I personally don’t feel like
baby sitting.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Cartwright shrugged. “Have Sergeant <span class=SpellE>Lanny</span>
bring Jane in here so they’re in one place. She can watch both of them.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Bullshit!” exclaimed Warner. “She’s working dispatch, and
you know how she just watches TV when we’re not here. You know how she is.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“What I know,” said Cartwright meaningfully, “is that I’m
hungry. I want something to eat. THEN we can do the paperwork and go home.
They’ll be okay for an hour or so.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“The cuffs stay on,” said Warner. “I’m not <span
class=SpellE>gonna</span> have my star witness killed by this sociopath.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Fine,” said Cartwright, “the cuffs stay on. But let’s go
out and get something. I want to show you a new Chinese place.....” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The two left, Warner glaring at her all the way out the
door. A little later, Sergeant <span class=SpellE>Lanny</span> brought a
handcuffed Jane in. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>!” said Jane loudly. <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> looked at her and shook her head slightly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Sergeant <span class=SpellE>Lanny</span> left saying,
“Keep it quiet in here you two,” and <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Jane
were alone. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,” said Jane softly, “I’m
so sorry this happened....” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“It’s not your fault, Jane,” interrupted <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> quickly, “you didn’t even know I had gotten a gun to
defend myself.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane blinked at her. Of course she knew! “But <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>....” Jane had walked to the chair Warner had sat in.
She scooted it around the table by pushing at it with her foot. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Jane, it’s just like at the Mall of the Millennium, when
I told you never to trust people while the light is on them, but wait until the
lights go off.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane blinked again, finally getting the chair near <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>, and leaning back into it a little as she tried to
figure out where THAT had come from. Then she glanced at the mirror and then
back at <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> nodded
slightly. “Those bastards,” Jane muttered almost inaudibly. “Can you at least
tell me what happened?” asked Jane in a more normal sounding voice. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Matthew threatened me and Quinn. You know that. What you
didn’t know is I took steps to make sure I’d be ready if he tried to carry out
his threats. Especially when I found out Mom filed a restraining order against
him. Psychos like <span class=GramE>Matthew,</span> they sometimes blow up when
you do that, even carrying out their death threats. So I was ready.” <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> looked at Jane meaningfully, and her voice shook a
little. “I’m sorry, Jane, I don’t know why they brought you in, too. I told
them that, but I don’t know if they believed <st2:State w:st="on"><st2:place
w:st="on"><span class=GramE>me</span>.</st2:place></st2:State>” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Hey,” said Jane, surprising <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
in the bright tone it was given in, “Maybe your mom can sue for wrongful
arrest?” Jane smiled. “She can get them back for busting you, and my family can
use the money!” Her smile broadened. “I’ll even chip in for your defense fund!
I’ll put up a Free <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> web site!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> smiled at her and then began crying softly again. Jane scooted
over next to <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and brushed her arm against <span
class=SpellE>Daria’s</span>. “Hey,” she said softly, “we’re still <span
class=SpellE>amigas</span>.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> smiled at her with a little humor. <span class=GramE>“Even
though you’re being released for testifying against me?”</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane’s eyes widened. “Huh? Oh, they told me that you said
I had forced you into it. I just didn’t say anything after that. Warner’s the
kind that makes me realize how ‘dick’ and ‘detective’ come to mean the same
thing.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> smiled and resisted the temptation to look at the mirror. Jane
scooted <span class=GramE>closer,</span> and whispered into <span class=SpellE>Daria’s</span>
ear, “<span class=SpellE>Wanna</span> put on an x-rated show and see how fast
they get back in here?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> actually laughed at that, just a little. “What makes you think
they wouldn’t just eat popcorn instead?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane laughed back. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> tapped Jane’s ankle with her foot. When Jane looked at her, <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> softly said, “Let’s make a deal. You don’t believe
anyone who says I already betrayed you, and I won’t believe anyone who says you
already betrayed me. No matter what, we will only believe it when we see each
other and confirm it.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane shrugged. “That was already my policy, <span
class=SpellE>amiga</span>.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> sighed in relief, and then looked at mirror thoughtfully.
“Something troubles me about all this.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane’s eyes went wide and she whistled. “ONLY one thing
troubles you? God, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, I wish I had your tolerance
for humiliation and intimidation.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> ignored her. “One said the <span class=SpellE>Sloanes</span>
might get me a lawyer. Where did that come from?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane shrugged. “No one said that to me. <span class=GramE>Would
be <span class=SpellE>kinda</span> cool if they’d chip in for our defense fund,
though.</span> I think I’ll ask them about it. I’m sure Tom will donate some of
his allowance anyway.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Maybe they can get me sent to one of the GOOD prisons,” <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> darkly mused. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>And then they talked of everyday things and pointedly
staying away from the topic of Matthew Foster and the hell he had visited on
them all. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> guessed it was two hours later when
Sergeant <span class=SpellE>Lanny</span> came and took Jane away again. Jane gave
<span class=SpellE>Daria</span> an encouraging smile as she left, even if it
disappeared to reveal fear when Jane was back out in the hall being carried
back to her detention cell. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Shortly after, Sergeant <span class=SpellE>Lanny</span>
came back in and put her in a cell with a woman with bleached hair who looked a
bit older than <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, though almost as thin and only
a little fuller. She was <span class=GramE>laying</span> on a bunk and looked
up curiously when <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> was put in. The entire cell
was sparsely furnished and couldn’t have been much more than 6’ by 6’ by 6’. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The cuffs were finally taken off. Incredible relief
flooded her as she rubbed her wrists, which had a red indention where the cuffs
had been. She offered no resistance when she was gently pushed inside. “Later,”
said Sergeant <span class=SpellE>Lanny</span> as she left. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
just walked over and collapsed on the bunk. The blanket was coarse, but it beat
being handcuffed in a chair. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Hey,” said the woman. “What they get you for?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> turned her head to look at her. The woman didn’t seem hostile,
just curious. She was at least in her 20’s. “Espionage,” she said. “You?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“<span class=SpellE>Mmmm</span>...” she said. <span
class=GramE>“Just a little crank.</span> I’ve mostly just slept since they put
me here, but I finally got bored with that. You ever do any crank?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I haven’t,” said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. “But I
plan to sleep until my mom gets me out.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Mom?” She looked at her. “Just how old are you?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“18,” said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. “You?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“25,” she said. “Wow, I can’t believe they put you here
back with me! But I know it wasn’t for <span class=SpellE>esp-ee-yanage</span>
or spying. Come on! What was it? Crank? Although you look more like a <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>mary</span></span> <span class=SpellE>jane</span>
type. Is that it?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> shook her head, still lying down completely. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>“Fine!</span></span><span
class=postbody> Don’t tell me.” She put herself back on her bunk. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> sighed. Why couldn’t she be put in solitary? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Hey,” said her cell mate. When <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
glanced at her again, she said, “I’m sorry about that. You look really tired.
But I’m really bored. I’d love it if you talk to <span class=GramE>me,</span>
fill in the endless boredom here. I can use a friend, and I bet you can, too.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> smiled slightly at her. “Let me sleep, okay? Then we’ll talk.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Okay.” She didn’t seem happy with this, but she accepted
it. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> was just starting to drift off when someone opened a small
shaft on the door. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> looked and saw her cell mate
grab a tray. She brought it over to <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. “Since
you’re tired and all, I thought I’d get it for you,” said her cell mate. Then
she got her own tray and started eating. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> sighed and at up. Oh, she could not believe this. <span
class=GramE>Lasagna.</span> And with her own new toothbrush, she wryly noted.
She sat down and ate, for she was hungry. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I’m Beth,” said her cell mate. <span class=GramE>“You?” <br>
<br>
“<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.”</span> That was just reflex. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Hey, you’re not that kid that shot up her school <span
class=GramE>are</span> you!?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> snorted a bit and took another bite. “Of course not,” she said,
her usual tone creeping back into her voice. “I wouldn’t kill them anywhere
near that quickly.” Then she frowned. Now she felt guilty for the people who
had been shot. Even for Ms. Li. </span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>When Beth kept looking at her, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
sighed and said, “A guy dating my sister threatened to kill me, along with my
sister. So I prepared, and shot him as he was shooting at my sister.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Wow,” she said. “And they arrested YOU? That just
figures. <span class=GramE>Creeps.”</span> She looked to the door and yelled,
“You’re a bunch of assholes!” Beth turned back to <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.
“Sorry, I just had to say that to them. It’s not like they would’ve done much
about that guy threatening you. But you, oh, they’ll throw the book at. I hate
this place.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“It’s better than cheerleading practice,” muttered <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“You’re a cheerleader?” asked Beth in a tone that said she
never would’ve guessed that. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“No,” said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> taking another
bite, “we just have to pretend we are in gym class.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“That sucks,” said Beth. “Where did you get the gun
anyway? I thought they were hard to come by around here.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> blinked at her. “The less you know, the better,” said <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> finished, hardly saying anything to Beth. She looked at her
toothbrush and decided only if it became absolutely necessary. Shortly after,
the orderly or whatever came back and took the trays. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
went and collapsed on the bunk. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Hey,” said Beth, “don’t conk out on me yet! I want to
hear all about what happened! Come on, they don’t even let me have a TV in this
place! It’s absolutely un-<span class=SpellE>fuggen</span>-civilized around
here!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“The less you know, the better,” <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
repeated. She finally promised to say more after she got some sleep. Beth was
obviously disappointed and whined awhile before she gave up and let <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> sleep in peace.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=postbody>------------------------------------ </span><br>
<span class=postbody>03/15/01, 9:52 A.M., Thursday </span><br>
<span class=postbody>-------------------------------------- </span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite Kramer, the DA, sighed as a frantic Helen <span
class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span> pleaded with her. She was sympathetic, and
even if she wasn't, she didn’t think she would dare prosecute this case.
Prosecute a girl that saved her own sister’s life, after the system failed to
stop the attacker? Her political enemies would trash her image, and her own
standing in several feminist organizations could be hurt. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Some of her other associations, such as the Virginia Association
of Black Lawyers, would probably see Matthew Foster as a racist that included
violent hate crimes along with his attack against Quinn <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>,
or would assume Matthew was typical of Lawndale. Most would be of the former,
and would probably see <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> as stopping him from
killing more minorities. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She had already received a call from both of the <span
class=SpellE>Landons</span> asking her not to prosecute <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>--and
their own daughter, Jodie Landon, had nearly been shot by that maniac, too,
which inclined them to be very sympathetic to <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.
And, she cynically noted to herself, the <span class=SpellE>Landons</span>
actually support her with money and volunteer campaigning for her, despite some
of the political differences they had. It would be good not to turn them
against her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Not only that, but Helen <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>
was her friend. When younger, both had been idealists, <span class=SpellE>ultrasensitive</span>
to the injustices of the world. Both had become lawyers to fight for those who
were chewed up mercilessly by the system, and to make it work for the People instead
of the Man. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>They had both become sidetracked when they encountered
many harsh realities. Disillusionment, making compromises, and financial
limitations and obligations had made them both switch their focus slightly. But
they still (sometimes) remembered why they had gotten into law in the first
place, and contributed what time and resources they had to groups they believed
were slowly helping the world become a better place. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ironically, that included some gun control laws that <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> was now likely to be charged under. What they did to
help these laws come about was nothing major, but the laws passed by the
collective effort of many like-minded citizens were now going to crush <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>, after proving themselves useless in saving Quinn’s
life. Did gun control save Quinn from Matthew? Oh, no. It was another gun. This
grated on her more than she cared to admit. It had to bother Helen, too. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Finally, she was the one that had made sure the
restraining order against Matthew Foster went into effect immediately for
Helen’s ease of mind. And then Matthew did what a lot of stalkers do and tried
to kill the object of his obsession. It was only a couple of days ago that she,
the DA, sent two deputies that owed her a favor directly to Matthew Foster to
tell Matthew in no uncertain terms never to speak, communicate, approach, or
even LOOK at Quinn again. <span class=GramE>For his sake.</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She remembered why as she stared down at the Polaroid and
other photos now developed of Quinn’s bruised cheek that Helen had taken
immediately upon noticing it and connecting it with Matthew. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>And 23 hours ago she had learned that the school shooting
on the news had been Matthew shooting two people, attempting to murder Quinn,
but being shot to death by <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. How could she
prosecute <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>But if she didn’t prosecute her friend’s daughter for
doing what all their laws and restraining orders failed to do, then her
political enemies could attack her for being too lenient on young hoodlums with
guns. The gun control groups could remove their support from her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>So be it, she decided. She had ambition from a real desire
to help <st2:country-region w:st="on"><st2:place w:st="on">America</st2:place></st2:country-region>
as well as from personal pride, but she wasn’t willing to do that if it made
her uneasy to sleep at <span class=GramE>night,</span> and caused the town she
served and the friends she valued hate her for it. She’d made too many
compromises as it was. This time, she was going to do something radical and
stand up for justice instead of politics. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Helen,” said Marguerite, “Calm down. I’ve already decided
not to prosecute your daughter. It sounds like she really felt she had no
choice. Maybe if I could charge her with something that I could recommend
probation, or if she were older, I’d think about it, as I think she acted too
hastily and with stupidity.” She held up her hand as Helen began to speak again,
“But in light that Quinn <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span> would be dead
if she hadn’t, I will not.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Thank you,” said Helen sincerely. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“No thanks are required for my refusal to prosecute,” said
Marguerite, “I will not fight to make the world safe for homicidal stalkers.”
She said the last with some passion. Then she sighed again and looked down. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“But that’s not going to help much, is it?” asked Helen,
already knowing the answer. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“It will help some,” said <span class=GramE>Marguerite ,</span>
“and I will make every resource I have access to available to you--discreetly,
of course. But there are laws and forces which I can do nothing about. If the
BATF choose to get involved, the entire circus will include the federal courts.
And whatever happens, you know this is going to be a circus, don’t you?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yes,” said Helen heatedly, “I’ve already dealt with far
too many clowns for my liking today. Police, news hounds, even political and
religious activists harassing me.” She shook her head as if to clear it. “What
can you tell me about the case?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite frowned. “Are you acting as her defense
attorney?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen nodded. “One of them, yes.” Knowing she would soon
see <i>The United States vs. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> <span
class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span></i> on top of everything else, she wasn’t
about to stay out of it, but neither was she going to do this alone. Criminal
law wasn’t her specialty. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Just to be on the safe side,” said Marguerite, “I’d
appreciate if you didn’t let people know I’m giving you access to all my files
until it becomes clear that you are officially on her defense team. Any future
files will have to be officially gotten through Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>.”
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Of course,” said Helen making a face, “and thank you.”
Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> was the city attorney. Helen had known
he was going to be a problem from the beginning. Helen had been the one and
only lawyer who successfully exposed his ethics violations and habit of
falsifying evidence, causing him to be suspended for 2 years and nearly
disbarred. Luckily, Marguerite had just said she could count on the unofficial
help of her office. That was no small advantage. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite wondered if <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>
was prosecuting this case because <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> was Helen’s
daughter. Normally, cases like this would be left to her discretion. In any
case, <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> saw opportunity here, or he wouldn’t
involve himself. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite smiled wryly at Helen. “By the way, that was
amazing what you did to him back in the 80s. After that, a lot of lawyers were
scared of you, weren’t they?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen nodded. She hadn’t thought about it much in years. <span
class=SpellE>Fillman</span> had been using false evidence to frame several
small businesses into giving up, or losing everything, so that Con-Tel could
monopolize the region. Because of Helen <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>,
Con-Tel got sued out of existence, and Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>
was suspended from his legal practice. She was a different person back then.
“Actually, it had been a private investigator that proved he was falsifying
evidence. I just made it stick.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“You showed them ethics can mean something,” returned
Marguerite. Ethics were a joke among lawyers. When given an ethics test, all
one had to say when in doubt (or say period) was, “I would not accept this case
in any circumstances.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yes,” said Helen in a low voice, remembering. “It’s a big
part of why I had to go into litigation. The other lawyers pretty much shunned
me.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite laughed lightly. “Shunned you? As I recall, no
one would give you the time of day, let alone any help you needed. You had to
leave <st2:City w:st="on"><st2:place w:st="on">Lawndale</st2:place></st2:City>
for more than ten years.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Of course Marguerite knew that. She was one of the few
people she stayed in contact with after she moved to <st2:City w:st="on"><st2:place
w:st="on">Highland</st2:place></st2:City>. Luckily, the incident seemed to be
forgotten after more than ten years passed. But by then, she was used to living
in <st2:City w:st="on"><st2:place w:st="on">Highland</st2:place></st2:City>. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>But then Helen thought of moving again because of the
rising crime. The final straw had been the BATF tearing up <span class=SpellE>Daria’s</span>
classroom and <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> witnessing the beating of her
teacher because he had advised the BATF of “due process.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>After she told Marguerite of this by phone, it wasn’t long
after that she got a call from a new law firm in <st2:City w:st="on"><st2:place
w:st="on">Lawndale</st2:place></st2:City> that was really impressed by a
glowing recommendation by a Marguerite Kramer. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen spoke a little bemusedly. “Yes, and I thank you for
helping me to move back.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I was glad to have you back, Helen,” replied Marguerite
warmly. They both reminded each other of times long ago when they still
believed in some things passionately. Had they ever been that young, and
willing to spit in the eye of ‘The Man’? It seemed like another lifetime. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Now to make sure Helen would get the message that there is
hope here, Marguerite thought. “My own PI, Earl Gentry, is digging up dirt on
his own, too. Maybe history will repeat itself?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I hope so,” said Helen sincerely. Maybe this time, they
could get him disbarred! Helen raised her eyes hopefully as she asked, “Know of
any other allies that can help me against <span class=SpellE>Filllman</span>?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I hate to say this,” said Marguerite as she lightly
covered her mouth with her hand as if to underscore how much she hated to say
it, “but I hear the NRA is already getting ready to use this case to challenge
the Gun-Free Zones Act and the Project Safe Neighborhoods.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Figures,” muttered Helen. “I’ve already have two messages
and one e-mail from the Virginia Citizens Defense League offering to help <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite smiled with a sense of self-depreciating irony
as she continued. “I’ve heard this from the groups you and I are a part of, of
course, who are getting ready to fight them. Just maybe, as much as it irks the
both of us, you should enlist the NRA’s help. Their financial, legal, and
political resources are vast, and you and your daughter are going to need all
the help you can get. Especially if this goes to a federal court, which it most
likely <span class=GramE>will.</span>” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen’s face hardened but she nodded. “I plan to at least
talk to them,” she said. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Good,” she said. “I won’t be surprised if there’s a
message from them on one of your message machines or e-mail accounts by the
time you get home. But there’s a complication.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen sighed, “Isn’t there always?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“You know Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> still
feels he has a score to settle with you over your revealing to the world what a
rat he is. With him, that would be enough for him to throw the book at <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>. More than that, he has political ambitions that he
pursues with ruthlessness. You know, of course, about his involvement with the
former mayor?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen nodded, stone-faced. Seems the former mayor had
indulged in hiring prostitutes with tax dollars, including one that brought her
underage daughter “to watch.” The new mayor, Marvin Grant, and her old enemy
Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> had turned him in. Marvin Grant took
his place in an emergency election promising to bring back morality and decency
to government. Later, further investigation suggested they knew to turn him in
because they had arranged for the illicit services to begin with, but Mayor
Grant had already stolen the office by then. It was just another example of why
Americans were generally disgusted with politics and ashamed of their
government. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Well,” said Marguerite, “he seems to be after the new <span
class=SpellE>mayorship</span>, now. He’s already seeing who he can get to back
him and finance his campaign for mayor if he crucifies your daughter.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“How will that help him against Grant?” asked Helen as
calmly as she could. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite smiled cynically, but without amusement. <span
class=GramE>“Seems the new mayor doesn’t want to alienate his backers among
Republicans and the NRA.</span> He’s sticking to his crime control not gun
control slogan. And he’s either going to fight to get <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
off... or he’s going to decide <span class=SpellE>Daria’s</span> a criminal
that took the law into her own hands. Right now, he’s waiting to see how the
political winds blow.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Justice means nothing to him,” said Helen. “Only
politics.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Of course,” replied Marguerite casually. “But one thing
in your favor is about to be released to the public.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yes?” asked Helen, hopeful. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Matthew Foster had a bag with 17 more bullets in his
jacket pocket. Not only that, but he had an entire box of ammo for his gun in
his backpack. Matthew meant to do more than shoot a couple of minorities and
kill his ex-girlfriend. Matthew was out to commit a massacre.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Oh,” said Helen shocked, shaking her head. Then she
brightened and felt horribly guilty for it, but also excited. “That means many
of the parents of the students of Lawndale High will see <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
as someone who may have saved their own child!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite nodded, but held up a hand. “Not necessarily.
You are likely to get a lot of local support, but it’s not a sure thing.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“But if that happens, then Roger will have an uphill
battle prosecuting <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite took in a deep breath and looked directly at
Helen. “In response, Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> has contacted
several groups like Handgun Control Inc. and promised to vigorously prosecute
not only <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, but also anyone who had a hand in
arming either her or Matthew Foster. He has already been promised support and
contributions from several gun control groups, and he’s hoping to use them to
also attack Marvin Grant’s reputation even further if he refuses to publicly
condemn <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, and to support himself as the new
mayor come the next election.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Oh, god,” said Helen disgustedly. That such a foul man
might become mayor of a town she lived in.... and might do so by crucifying <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>.... she trembled with rage and hatred for Roger <span
class=SpellE>Fillman</span>. The fact that Helen helped, if only a little, to
get some of the laws passed that Roger was now using with relish only deepened
her hatred for him. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“One bit of news,” continued Marguerite, “and is not clear
if it’s good or bad, is that Judge Tim Oliver will be presiding.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen thought about that. Judge Oliver had ambitions, but
he was also lazy, content to just get his fingers in several dirty pies. He
also loved to pose for the media. He would do whatever would get him the most
positive press, and possibly the most money. Right now, it was too early in the
game to guess which way Judge Oliver would lean. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen moaned, “Is there anyone who cares about justice
over politics?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Another complication,” said Marguerite, as if she hadn’t
heard Helen’s comment. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“How many complications can there be?” groaned Helen
rhetorically. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“The police are being very slow to actually charge <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> with a crime. They appear as if they’re going to hold
her for the 48 hours if they can before they do anything official. I’ve already
tried to pressure them to press charges and get the process going, but they’re
stalling. And I hear Detective Dan Warner is seeking some kind of damage
control by prosecuting <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, but I don’t know what
it is, yet. Consider that an unverified rumor that I will confirm or cancel in
a day or two.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“If he needs to build up a good rep, how come he can’t do
it by getting people like Matthew off our streets?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“They’re after bigger game,” said Marguerite, “and <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> has just become the biggest prize of all.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“How far are they willing to go?” asked Helen quietly,
bracing herself. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite shrugged. “They’re not very bright or
competent, especially since the ‘average intelligence’ required for the job is
heavily enforced.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen just stared. <span class=GramE>“Average intelligence?”</span>
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite shrugged again. “That means not too smart.
Because a smart officer would get bored patrolling <st2:City w:st="on"><st2:place
w:st="on">Lawndale</st2:place></st2:City>, and likely quit.” To Helen’s
disbelieving gaze, she responded, “I’m serious.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen shook her head. That help explained what had happened
a little, but not completely. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite continued, “But they do know the tricks to
cracking suspects and even getting them to confess to crimes that were never
committed in the first place. Not all of them are fully legal, but between the
fact that they’re detectives and that Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>
will vouch for them, there’s not likely to be a lot I can do about such
methods, unless they’re dumb enough to be blatant about it.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen shook her head saying, “<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
is smart. She won’t fall for that. And she can drink hot water and spit out ice
cubes.” Then Helen remembered <st2:Street w:st="on"><st2:address w:st="on">Jane
  Lane</st2:address></st2:Street> was also arrested, and knew fear. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I hope you’re right,” said Marguerite, “for her sake.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“You don’t think they’d... abuse her, do you?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“No,” said Marguerite firmly. “Not when you’re going to be
breathing down their necks over every little thing they do. And they’re not all
behind the blue shield. There are police there who are sick of what’s going on
and very willing to help me in any way to stop the abuses going on.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite didn’t suggest the horrible possibility that
they might arrange for <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> to be put in a cell with
someone who WOULD hurt her to encourage her to “confess.” But even that was
unlikely, especially since she was already riding their back over every little
thing they did. She hoped such knowledge would dissuade them from such
barbarity. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Marguerite?” asked Helen, “what about <st2:Street w:st="on"><st2:address
w:st="on">Jane Lane</st2:address></st2:Street>?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite pursed her lips and went through some files.
“Oh, yes, <st2:Street w:st="on"><st2:address w:st="on">Jane Lane</st2:address></st2:Street>,”
she said. “<st2:Street w:st="on"><st2:address w:st="on">Ms. Lane</st2:address></st2:Street>
was officially picked up for suspicion because the footage shows Jane going
back to <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> after <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
shot Matthew.” She had emphasized the word “officially” just enough for Helen
to catch it. “That’s it. Of course all parties are interested in where <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> got the... the weapon used, since it’s widely
believed that you won’t have a gun yourself.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“That’s right,” said Helen as she wondered what the
unofficial reason for arresting Jane was, “I made Jake sell his guns some time
ago.” Then she made a face. “The dog the police ran through our house yesterday
should’ve convinced them, too.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite blinked at that. She hadn't looked at
everything yet, but she had no reason to think she would come across anything
like that. “They used dogs in your house?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“They said something about searching <span class=SpellE>Daria’s</span>
room for bombs and ammo. Then I caught them in Quinn’s room and all over the
house. I tried kicking them out and they threatened to arrest me for
interfering in an investigation!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite raised her brows. <span class=GramE>“The entire
house?”</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen’s eyes grew a bit distant. “They made a mess,
especially of <span class=SpellE>Daria’s</span> and Quinn’s room. It’s going to
take hours to get everything sorted, cleaned, and put back where it belongs. I
don’t understand why they tore up Quinn’s room! And Quinn was upset enough
before they did that.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite shook her head. “They’re taking a big risk,”
she said visibly surprised that they went to such lengths. “When you’re ready
to sue their socks off, let me know. I’ll help” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen smiled warmly. “Thank you.” Then she frowned.
&quot;Do you think they searched the Lane residence, too?&quot; </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite spoke thoughtfully. &quot;I'm sure they did,
but I haven't come across that.&quot; She shook her head again. &quot;This is
strange.&quot; </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; moaned Helen. “What can you tell
me of <span class=SpellE>Daria’s</span> gun?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“The gun, a .32 Mark II, is unregistered. It was also
loaded with <span class=SpellE>JHPs</span>....” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“<span class=SpellE>JHPs</span>?” asked Helen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>“Jacketed Hollow Points.”</span></span><span
class=postbody> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>That didn’t sound good. “Are <span class=SpellE>JHPs</span>
particularly bad?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“They’re hollow bullets that deal more soft-tissue damage
when they flatten out, which makes them more deadly. They’re also harder for
forensics to investigate, though any dedicated examiner will still find what
they’re looking for. But they’re common among hunters and police both,
partially because they’re less likely to ricochet.” She shrugged. “And they
said this is the only type of bullet that would be effective for this type of
gun. By the way, Helen, has <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> ever practiced with
any kind of firearm before, or taken a firearm training course?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen shook her head. “Not to my knowledge. I can’t
imagine her leaving her room for any kind of physical activity if she can help <span
class=GramE>it</span>.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Then why was she such a good shot?” She pulled another
file out and opened it. <span class=GramE>“Two in the center of the back, one in
the head.</span> The head caused more massive brain damage than would normally <span
class=GramE>happened</span>, and one of the two shots in his back pierced his
spinal cord. We say she’s been trained, and trained well, in how to use a gun
to kill.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen shivered. She vaguely recalled some jokes about a
“Melody Powers,” and “working for the government.” But she shook her head again
and said, “I don’t know what to tell you.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“That’s not the only mystery,” said Marguerite, “The gun
does not show up on NLET, and neither does the gun used by Matthew Foster,
though no one has given up trying to trace the two guns.....” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen interrupted with, “NLET?<span class=GramE>” .</span>
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>“National Law Enforcement
Telecommunications System.”</span></span><span class=postbody> When Helen
nodded, she continued. “Even more interesting is that <span class=SpellE>Daria’s</span>
gun has been heavily coated with <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>teflon</span></span>
which makes getting any fingerprints impossible for all practical purposes.
Forensics claims the <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>teflon</span></span>
was added in specifically for that purpose. The only prints they can identify
are <span class=SpellE>Daria’s</span> most recent ones.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“But Matthew’s gun wasn’t coated with this <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>teflon</span></span>?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite shook her head. “No. Matthew didn’t seem to
take all that good care of his gun. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, on the
other hand, looks to have treated her gun with a lot of TLC.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen swallowed. “So you have no idea where it came from?”
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I would guess it was sold to a hobbyist in one of the
loopholes used by gun enthusiasts. That hobbyist may even be <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>. Even if this is the case, it should’ve cost her no
less than $250, given its condition, and that doesn’t count the <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>teflon</span></span> job or the hollow points
she had, or the bullets she used in learning to use her gun. Did <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> have that kind of cash on her? Has she asked for a
lot of money, or for a lot of little bits of cash over and over again?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen shook her head, but remembered all the times <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> made Helen bribe her. She thought <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
did that to other people, too. It wasn’t impossible for her to raise the money,
but why would she buy a gun? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite continued. “It’s a wild card, so to speak, but
no one seriously believes the gun belongs to you or Jake. Personally, I’d guess
<span class=SpellE>Daria</span> got it at a gun show. Here in <st2:State w:st="on"><st2:place
w:st="on">Virginia</st2:place></st2:State>, there are no criminal background
checks required and more than a few gun dealers are completely unlicensed.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Damnation,” moaned Helen. This was another example of why
she pushed for greater gun control. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Even felons not allowed firearms can usually get one
there. So <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> shouldn’t have a problem, if she had
the money. An officer discreetly told me that some strongly suspect <st2:Street
w:st="on"><st2:address w:st="on">Jane Lane</st2:address></st2:Street> of getting
the gun for her. Why they suspect this is beyond me, but I haven’t looked at
all the reasons and evidence available yet. Maybe I’ve missed something
important.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen sensed that Marguerite wasn’t telling all. “So we
have the excuse on why they’re holding Jane, but what is their real reason? Is
she a dangerous liability to us?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite looked sadly at Helen. “They’re pressuring her
to testify against <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> or to confess to getting the
gun for <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. If she cracks, she’s a liability to <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> and to herself. If she doesn’t, they will likely let
her go, but only so they can see where she goes and who she <span class=GramE>talks</span>
to.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“They think Jane would lead them to the source of the
gun?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Maybe,” said Marguerite with an unreadable expression.
“There’s also the possibility she’ll talk. That’s how most cases are cracked,
you know. People can’t keep their mouth shut, and kids are especially bad about
it. Especially if they feel they got away with something.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Marguerite, please!” pleaded Helen, “what are you not
telling me?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite grimaced and cleared her throat. “I am about to
tell you something that you would be very ill-advised to repeat outside this
office.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen drew in breath and braced herself. “Go on.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite added, “In fact, should you find evidence of
anything I’m about to share with you, it would be wise if you thought twice
before bringing it to me or even letting me know such evidence exists.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“That bad?” Helen was getting scared. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite nodded her head. “Matthew Foster was known to
vice cops as a petty drug dealer.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“No,” said Helen disbelieving, “he’s a clean cut boy....”
She trailed off. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“A clean cut boy with a nice car and money to take Quinn
to Chez Pierre,” said Marguerite, “from a low income, single parent family on welfare.
A clean cut boy who would never try to kill your daughter.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“That bastard,” whispered Helen in moment of fury and
panic. Then she remembered something. “Just last month, on the Saturday after
Valentine’s Day, Quinn, the Fashion Club she’s with, and some other boys went
to a family cabin belonging to Matthew’s family. What about that?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“We’re looking into that as we speak. You see, Helen, we
can’t find out where Matthew got his gun, either, and we believe it belongs to
his father, just as that cabin does.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“But you’re not sure.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“No,” she said. “Matthew’s father is barred from having
guns as part of the restraining order barring him from contacting Matthew’s
mother.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen leaned back in her chair. This just got better and
better. “What else?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite smiled grimly. “He filed a restraining order
back at her with the same condition added in. So technically, she’s not allowed
guns either. As they both have a history of substance abuse, trouble with the
law, mental illness, and domestic violence by both against each other, neither
had any trouble in getting the restraining order extended to a few years. But
they seem to have done it more out of spite than actual fear.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She pulled out another file and opened it. “Matthew’s
mother’s house was searched and no weapons were found. The father’s house was
searched, and we found two handguns. But the lab is saying they don’t think
Matthew’s gun came from there. Matthew’s gun isn’t as well taken care of and
doesn’t have any of his father’s prints. There are also some telltale chemicals
that forensics looks at, and their examination leads them to conclude that
Matthew’s gun never belonged to Matthew’s father. A warrant is being drawn up
to search the cabin that was left to Matthew’s father two years ago when
Matthew’s grandfather died, but nobody really expects to find anything.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I’d like to know what you find, even if it’s nothing,”
said Helen, “since my daughter spent a day out there skiing!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I’ll be sure to tell you,” Marguerite replied, “but the
lab boys believe the father when he says he’s never seen the gun Matthew used
in his life. It’s just one more mystery in all this crud.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I hope there aren’t any more surprises,” said Helen in a
low voice. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite looked down a moment and looked back up. “Oh, I
saved the best for last.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Please, tell me!” Helen was getting annoyed with this
game of digging information out of her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite cleared her throat. “Jane, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,
and Quinn were apparently mentioned in a report from an informant to a vice cop
as being in a drug ring with Matthew Foster. Another informant even stated that
<span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Matthew got into a gang related dispute
that ended in gunfire at a seedy little bar known as the Zen a little over a
week ago.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen’s leaned forward, her eyes wide in shock and anger.
“That’s impossible!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Is it?” asked Marguerite calmly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“That’s just so.... it’s impossible,” said Helen shaking
her head. “Until recently, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Quinn almost
never got along together. I mean I’m as shocked as I am grateful that <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> did what she did to save Quinn.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“The detectives don’t believe <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
shot Matthew to save Quinn,” said Marguerite carefully. “They suspect <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> shot Matthew because he was about to be busted and
reveal names, including <span class=SpellE>her’s</span> and Quinn’s. It’s even
been suggested that <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> meant for Quinn to die
first. They also claim that Quinn hid the drugs that police knew Matthew had
purchased, but it wasn’t until last Monday that the police even knew about his
relation with Quinn.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“NO!” shouted Helen standing up. “That’s just so warped!
Those cops are crazy! It’s nothing like that at all!” She took a breath and sat
back down. “I’m sorry for that outburst. It’s just that it’s so crazy. You
don’t believe any of that, do you?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I think the detectives are incompetent, especially if
what they said is true about not knowing of the relationship between Matthew
and Quinn until last Monday, and Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> is
desperate to do anything to win this case,” said Marguerite carefully, “but I’m
also convinced that there is more going on here than we realize. If <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> is as smart and cool under fire as you say, why did
she bring a gun to school? And where did she get it? And what about the <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>teflon</span></span>?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen had no response to that. Finally she took in a
breath. “It turned out she needed it.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“What she needed was to get Matthew out of the way, one
way or another. <span class=GramE>For one reason or another.”</span> When Helen
gave Marguerite a hurt look, she shook her head. “I’m on your side Helen. But I
feel there is something more to this story than you or I know about. Roger <span
class=SpellE>Fillman</span> and the Lawndale PD fully believe this to be so and
are very anxious to get to the bottom of it. And that’s why Jane will likely be
released without charges if she can’t be used to harm <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
directly. To see if she can be made to harm <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> in
another way.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Impossible,” Helen repeated. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“If <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> were a drug dealer,”
said Marguerite slowly, “it would explain how she got the money to get a gun,
and why she carried it around and learned to use it.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen pushed her rising fury away at what Marguerite was
saying. “Is there ANY evidence to any of these claims besides the
unsubstantiated claims of an informant, whom I assume to be a drug user
himself, that this suspected involvement took place?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite put her hands together for a moment and spoke
very clearly. “No, there is not. And your <span class=GramE>assumption about
the informant being a drug user and insinuating the informant to be unreliable
are</span> both correct. Investigation at the Zen has so far turned up nothing,
and not a single bullet hole was found, thus discrediting the allegations of
any shoot-out. Everyone the police talked to claimed that such a story was
ridiculous, but they’re only getting warmed up. Still, the informant swears
it’s true and seems to believe it.&quot; </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Then she knocked her half-folded fingers against her desk
as she said, “However, if Jane Lane is released, she will be closely watched,
tailed, and monitored to see if any such connection between Matthew Foster’s
drug dealing can be made to her.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Then it’s Jane’s problem more than <span class=SpellE>Daria’s</span>,
right?” Helen asked desperately. “She won’t turn on <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.
I know it.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Helen,” said Marguerite in her tone of voice that said
this was very important, “if they succeed at this they have an automatic connection
to <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span> via <st2:Street
w:st="on"><st2:address w:st="on">Jane Lane</st2:address></st2:Street>. Between <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Matthew, they have an automatic connection to
Quinn <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>. If nothing else, they can entrap
Jane and then extort her to testify against <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,
even if she has to lie. They’ve done it others before.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I better warn Jane,” said Helen more to herself than to
Marguerite. <i>And I better represent her along with <span class=SpellE>Daria</span></i>,
she thought to herself. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“You do that,” said Marguerite, “but make sure you sound
like a concerned mother asking about her daughter than a conspirator in a
crime. You know Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> would love to implicate
you, too, if he thought <span class=GramE>he</span> possibly could.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Don’t I know it,” gritted Helen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Right now, Jane is the one who will need to exercise the
most caution. If they can, they will do just about anything to extort her to
turn against <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“They’d destroy Jane just to get <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>?”
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite gave Helen a look of disbelief, saying, “You
have to ask?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen took a deep breath. “I’ve had experiences from my
own college days with the fuzz, and I know there are a lot of nasty secrets
below the mirage of respectability. So I can accept everything you’re telling
me with very little difficulty, and know that sometimes it gets even worse.”
Then Helen shook her head to emphasize her next statement. “But the police even
thinking that <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, Quinn, and Jane in a drug ring
with Matthew! That is just too unbelievable. Even the police have to know
that!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And it may be nothing more than smoke and mirrors,” said
Marguerite relaxing her voice, “but Helen, you know what this could do to your
daughter’s case if any such connection is proven.” Marguerite spoke then with
emphasis. “Talk to your daughter and find out if there’s any truth to these
allegations at all. And do it soon in case the police decide to ask Quinn about
it first.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen nodded in stunned disbelief. “I will.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“In any case,” said Marguerite businesslike, “find out
where <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> acquired the gun. I think that’s the key
to this whole mystery. You can count on Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>
to hammer away at this until he finds out the truth for himself. I expect he
will find out. And when he does, Helen, you better be ready for him.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen fought tears as she rubbed her temples, muttering,
“I don’t know who I hate more, Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> or Matthew
Foster.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“You’d hate Matthew Foster more if he had killed Quinn.
Which would you rather do, Helen? Try to save <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
from being crucified for saving your other daughter, or trying to crucify
Foster for the murder of Quinn <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen choked once in a stunted sob and then regained
control of <span class=GramE>herself</span>. She wiped a single tear away as
she pulled herself out of her sudden bout of self-pity. “I feel like my entire
world is crumbling around me, Marguerite, and I’m just now coming to realize just
how little I know about my own children.” She shook her head, taking a deep
breath, and composed herself. “Thank you for your help,” she said quietly as
she got up. “I should be getting back to Quinn.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Of course,” replied Marguerite, also getting up and
walking over to Helen and touching her hand. “And I’m looking into some sources
that Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> won’t expect. I hope I find
something I can give you to use against him,” she said with sincerity, “because
not only will it help my career if he’s out of my way, but I hate that bastard,
too.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Thank you,” said Helen, giving Marguerite a brief hug,
“for everything.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite squeezed Helen’s arm. “Just be glad you still
have Quinn to go back to, Helen <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=postbody>---------------------------------------- </span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>As she had done for breakfast, Beth woke <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> up for lunch. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> groaned
some and then reached for where she had put her glasses. She was glad they let
her keep them as she was practically blind without them. When she looked up
with her glasses on, she saw Beth standing in front of her holding her tray out
to her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> mumbled her thanks and started eating without much thought. She
didn’t think she would go back to sleep right after the way she had done after
breakfast. She wondered how much longer they were going to keep her here.
Didn’t they have bigger pens somewhere with TV or something? She was going to <span
class=GramE>miss</span> <i>Sick, Sad World</i>. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“You were thrashing around in your sleep,” said Beth. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Huh?” asked <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> brightly.
Then she understood and just said, “Oh.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“What were you dreaming about?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> tried to recall. She couldn’t really remember. Quinn was in it,
and Jane. No Matthew or cops or jail or anything like that. In what little of
her dream she could recall, she did not think of where she now was or what had
just happened. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I don’t remember enough,” said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I bet you were dreaming about shooting up your school,”
said Beth. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Maybe,” <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> replied. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“It’s so boring without a TV,” Beth said. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> grunted her sympathy. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Hey, is there a place still called the Zen?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> nodded. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Oh, you’ve been there! I haven’t been there in awhile.
What’s going on there now?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Same <span class=SpellE>ol</span>’ stuff as always. Bands
play, people get intoxicated and leave together to make decisions they’ll
regret the rest of the lives, and everything else that people do in any place
they go to.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I hear that place has gotten <span class=SpellE>kinda</span>
rough lately. Is it?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> shook her head. “Not really.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“A lot of hot merchandise gets moved at places like that.
Well, not a lot, not in <st2:City w:st="on"><st2:place w:st="on">Lawndale</st2:place></st2:City>,
but they have it, too. I bet you got your gun there, huh?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> stared at her deadpan. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“No, I bet you had a gun before you went to the Zen,
didn’t you?” Beth smiled conspiratorially at her. “C’mon, anything ever
happened to you there?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> frowned. Obviously, someone knew something had happened at the
Zen, but they didn’t know what happened. Beth was to find out for them. That’s
why she was in this cell without a TV. They hoped she would get so bored she’d
spill everything to Beth, who was either a cop or someone that would get
time-off for good behavior or something. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Once,” said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, “but you’ll
need to show me your security clearance before I can tell you about how I
almost averted World War III.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Almost?” Beth blinked several times, and then frowned at <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>. “Well, I’d rather hear about you shooting up your
school anyway,” said Beth. “Like, why did you do it?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“You mean besides the obvious reasons?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Beth seemed a little taken aback, and then she forced a
laugh. “Yeah, besides that.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I was bored, and thought I would liven things up a bit.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Beth frowned, and for a second she looked angry. And then
she tapped her right foot, whining, “Can’t you <span class=SpellE>pleeeeaase</span>
tell me what happened? I’m so bored here that I think I’ll just start screaming
if SOMETHING doesn’t entertain me soon!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> sighed. Okay. But just to be on the safe side, she’d get the
heavily edited script she was saving for everyone else. “Quinn dates a lot of
guys, and she started dating Matthew....” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And you liked Matthew?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“No,” said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> with a little
emphasis. “I don’t really like many of Quinn’s boyfriends. But Quinn decided
she didn’t want to date him anymore and dropped him. Matthew wouldn’t accept
that. He said Quinn used him and discarded him. Then he would try to convince
her to take him back. Obviously, the guy was a nut case.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Beth encouraged her by leaning toward her a bit. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Jane and I happened to walk down the stairs of my house
when we heard him by the front door threatening to hurt Quinn, to show her she
couldn’t just use guys like that. I picked up the phone and Jane told asked
Quinn if she wanted us to <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>dail</span></span>
9-1-1.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Jane? Who’s Jane?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“A friend. <span class=GramE>Or at least someone who will
talk to me.</span> Anyway, Quinn said be ready if he didn’t leave right <span
class=GramE>away,</span> and Matthew pushed past her coming towards me. I hit
the 9 and he threatened to break my fingers if I didn’t stop. He said he could
do that before the police got there. Then we all heard a beep. We all saw Quinn
with a cell phone to her ear and she ran out the door, slamming it behind her.
Matthew turned to me and bluntly said, ‘The police can take me away, but they
can’t keep me away. Remember that you,’ <span class=SpellE>yadda</span>, <span
class=SpellE>yadda</span>, <span class=SpellE>yadda</span>, and a bunch of
obscenities. Then he went out and grabbed Quinn. Quinn says he smashed her
phone while he says Quinn dropped it. Then he hit Quinn and left before the
cops showed up.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And they didn’t go after him at all, did they?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yeah, they did actually,” said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.
“They just didn’t keep him. It’s pretty much as he said, the police could take
him away, but they couldn’t keep him away. What really bothered me was he was
surprised when we did what we did and was unsure about what to do. I knew he’d
have a plan the next time. And I heard rumors that he had a gun, and I started
researching stalker cases that really bothered me. And then my mom filed a
restraining order against him, and I had just read that such orders sometimes
cause stalkers to go postal. So I prepared. When Matthew showed up shooting at
Quinn, I shot him first. End of story, except for me being here. There were two
other people shot, but that was by Matthew, not by me.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Beth shook her head a bit, seemingly fascinated. “Wow,”
she finally said. “That sounds like you saved a life. Why did they arrest you
for?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Because I had a gun in a so-called gun-free zone. I’m
being charged with his murder, too.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Those assholes,” Beth murmured. “But I hear you fired
three shots, and all hit vital spots. <span class=GramE>Where did you learn to
shoot?” <br>
<br>
“Beginner’s luck.</span> I read the instructions and I was careful.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Beth showed annoyance for a second, saying, “Uh, <span
class=SpellE>hu</span>,” in a way that said she didn’t really believe that.
Then she put on a sad face and looked down. After a bit, she shyly said, “<span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>.... there’s this guy that beats me up sometimes, and
he has a gun, too. I want to leave him, but I’m afraid. Could you <span
class=SpellE>pleeease</span> tell me how I could get a gun around here without
everyone knowing about it? Please?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria’s</span></span><span
class=postbody> eyes hardened just a bit. Everyone wanted to know where she got
her gun. Was Beth telling the truth, or was she getting a special deal if she
found out for the police? <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> decided then that in
any case, where she got a gun wouldn’t do her any good anyway, so she just
shook her head. “Sorry,” said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, “but my source
would never deal with me again after my face has been all over the news. He’s
probably in <st2:country-region w:st="on"><st2:place w:st="on">Mexico</st2:place></st2:country-region>
somewhere by now.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Can’t you help me at all?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“There are plenty of places to get guns, especially for
someone your age.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Beth shook her head. “I’m a convict, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.
I can’t.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> wasn’t too streetwise, but she knew there were still ways to
get a gun. <span class=GramE>Besides....</span> “Why don’t you just leave?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“He’d track me down and kill <st2:State w:st="on"><st2:place
w:st="on"><span class=GramE>me</span>.</st2:place></st2:State>” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Not if you made sure the police found him while he had a
lot of drugs on him or in his vehicle.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Beth leaned forward, looking at <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
with what appeared to be real hope in her eyes. “<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,”
she whispered, “would you know of a source my boyfriend doesn’t know about for
crystal? That would be even better than the gun.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria’s</span></span><span
class=postbody> brows raised and she smiled. “Sure, I’ll fix you right up. I
keep my crystal hidden in a box of baking soda. <span class=GramE>Cash
upfront.”</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Beth frowned. She obviously wasn’t giving up, but she had
no reply to that. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> wondered if she was just
being paranoid, or if the cops really were trying to set her up. And if they
were trying to set her up, was her instinctive distrust still paranoia? She
could definitely feel the hidden mines all around her just waiting for her to
make one small misstep. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> entertained Beth with other <span class=GramE>things,</span>
and Beth shared a little about her own screwed up life. One that came down to
asking <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> for help in getting away from him, and
if only she had a gun.... </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The door was suddenly being opened. Sergeant <span
class=SpellE>Lanny</span> was there, one hand on one hip, one on the door. “<span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>,” she simply
said. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> got up, and followed her out without a word. She was almost
pathetically grateful when the cuffs didn’t go back on. She was escorted to a
bright room on the second story, even with a large window she could see outside
into <st2:City w:st="on"><st2:place w:st="on">Lawndale</st2:place></st2:City>. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>A young woman sitting at a desk smiled warmly at <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>. She had short blonde hair that looked both easy to
care for and stylish. She got up and walked professionally and competently up
to <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, extending her hand. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Ms. <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>?” said the
woman in a voice that sounded concerned, “I’m Ms. Palmer, a lawyer who is very
interested in your case.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> extended her own hand and felt Ms. Palmer shake firmly. She
never lost her smile. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> raised a brow. “Aren’t
you a little young to be a lawyer?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. Palmer laughed, “Aren’t you a little young to know how
to get on my good side?” She waved at a chair in front of the desk she had been
sitting at. “Please, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, sit down and we’ll talk
about your case.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> walked over and sat down. Ms. Palmer chatted about how far
feminism had come and how far it had to go. Stalkers were a menace to women
everywhere. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> let it go in one ear and out there
other before asking, “Why isn’t my mom here?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“She will be here soon, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,
but she’s still working on preparing a good defense, and that’s something
you’re really going to need.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“You don’t have to sound so cheerful about it,” muttered <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Oh, the challenge of it is exciting, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>!
Challenge is a spice that makes victory taste that much sweeter!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>When <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> just stared at her
silently, Ms. Palmer lost a little of her smile, a little nervous. She took a
drink of her coffee before smiling again, saying, <span class=GramE>“</span>Calm
down, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. We can all be friends here. I just
wanted to ask you a little about the case, if that’s all right with you?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> just stared, but her expression said it might be... and it
might not be. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. Palmer cleared her throat. “Now <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,”
she began as she opened up a file and started looking at some papers within.
“Where did you get the gun?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> crossed her arms. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,” Ms. Palmer said in a
quiet, concerned voice, “it’s possible that some of these charges can be levied
at the one who armed you in the first place instead of yourself. Don’t you want
that?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> said, “Sorry, but that is information that I can’t give out.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Will you tell the judge that, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>?”
Ms. Palmer looked at <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> meaningfully. “Do you know
what contempt of court is?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Fine,” said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, “I’ll make
something up.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. Palmer cleared her throat again. “I did not hear
that.” She shuffled through some more papers. “Okay, let’s get on with what you
are willing to tell me at this time. You believed Matthew to be a threat?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> began talking, sharing everything she had told her cell mate
Beth, and nothing more. She was glad now that she had a chance to rehearse it
because Ms. Palmer knew how to ask unexpected questions in such a way that <span
class=SpellE>Daria’s</span> natural reaction was to give answers before she
thought about it. It was a little unnerving. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Finally, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> said, “Look, if
you don’t mind, I’d like to talk to Mom now. Can you call her for me?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Your mom is busy, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,” said
Ms. Palmer, losing a bit of her warmth. “She’ll be along when she can.
Meanwhile, I’m supposed to get some information to make this case go smoother.
Please help me, okay?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>When <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> didn’t respond, she
took another drink and then opened another file. “You’re a good student, <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>,” she said sounding pleased, “I like that. And you’re
smart, too. <span class=GramE>How much planning went into ‘being prepared’?” <br>
<br>
“None.</span> I got a gun just in case, and that was it.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“How did you get it past the metal detectors?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I left it in my bag outside the craft building and went
around, opened the door and got it.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,” said Ms. Palmer, “Jane
Lane told us she went in while you waited outside. Being something of an
artistically created student, she was able to get into the craft shop with
little suspicion. She then let you in, knowing you had a gun under your shirt.
She did this for the day before the shooting and for the day of the shooting.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> stared wide-eyed. That was what actually happened. Had <st2:Street
w:st="on"><st2:address w:st="on">Jane Lane</st2:address></st2:Street> really
told her this? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. Palmer smiled at <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> with
warmth. “<st2:Street w:st="on"><st2:address w:st="on">Jane Lane</st2:address></st2:Street>
trusts me,” she said sweetly. “And so can you.” She took another drink of her
coffee and then flipped to another page, this time hiding it from <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>. “Okay, according to Jane Lane, you both decided that
Matthew was going to hurt you or Quinn, or both of you, and you had to get him
before he got either of you.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“No, she did not say that,” said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
in a frosty tone, “she was letting me in because I asked her to, without her
knowing why. I told her it was an experiment to see how long before Ms. Li
caught on. It can be fun to play with Ms. Li’s paranoid little head, and I said
if she was good enough not to be caught all week, I’d even pay her $20, but
she’d have to pay me if she was caught.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Please, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, don’t lie to me.
Why would you come up with such an unlikely scheme, and why would Jane go along
with it?” Ms. Palmer was tapping a paper with a pen as she leaned forward a bit
to hear <span class=SpellE>Daria’s</span> answer. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> fumed at Ms. Palmer telling her not to lie! In a frosty voice,
she replied, “I secretly figured that if Matthew didn’t show up that week
intending harm, then Matthew was bluffing and I could stop bringing the gun to
school. <span class=GramE>But Jane thought we were just playing a head game
while contesting a wager.</span> I have no idea where you came up with what you
claim Jane said, but I know you’re lying, because that statement you said Jane
made is not true. That’s all I have to say, except this interview is over.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,” said Ms. Palmer,
looking wounded, “Please. I’m trying to help you and your friend. You have both
been the victim of a horrible crime, just as much as Quinn <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>
was, and yet you two are being treated as the criminals. Help me to help you.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> looked away. “I want to talk to Mom.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. Palmer sighed. “Okay, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.
Are you sure you’re willing to abandon Jane? She won’t be happy to hear you
contradicted her story.” When <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> said nothing, she
pushed a button that made a slight buzz that <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
could hear. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Soon, Sergeant <span class=SpellE>Lanny</span> came back
in. “You done?” she asked gruffly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yes, we’re done for now,” said Ms. Palmer all business
like. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Can’t I at least call my mom?” asked <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Your mother is too busy,” said Ms. Palmer, now sounding
like a glacier. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> left, feeling alone. Was Ms. Palmer really on her team? How did
she know about Jane’s part in this? But there was no plan to get Matthew first,
so where had that come from? <span class=SpellE>Daria’s</span> eyes narrowed. <st2:Street
w:st="on"><st2:address w:st="on">Jane Lane</st2:address></st2:Street> hadn’t
talked. So how did they know what they did? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> suddenly stopped, causing Sergeant <span class=SpellE>Lanny</span>
to bump into her. She started walking again. The camera! It caught Jane coming
into the school alone, going to the craft shop and coming out with <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> beside her. There was no cam in the shop itself. The
investigators had watched the footage and made a reasonable guess over what
happened. She remembered the cam now, but had forgotten it after she and Jane
had figured out how to sneak her gun into school. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> grew angry at how she had nearly betrayed her friend, but also
felt relief in that she hadn’t. Ms. Palmer was another minefield. Paranoia
would be her policy now. But would that ploy work on Jane? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She stopped again. “Sergeant <span class=SpellE>Lanny</span>?”
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“What?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I haven’t had my phone call yet. I’d like to make my call
now.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I can send someone to get you,” she said. But it wasn’t
firm. She was just being lazy. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Please,” <span class=GramE>said</span> <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>. “My mom’s my real lawyer and I need to talk to her
right now. It’s urgent.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Sergeant <span class=SpellE>Lanny</span> sighed
theatrically. “Fine, come back this way.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She soon came to a pay phone. Was she supposed to call
collect? She looked at Sergeant <span class=SpellE>Lanny</span>, who sighed
again and pulled out some change to put in the phone. She called home, hoping
someone would be home. She braced herself for Quinn. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen’s voice came on that told <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
it was the answering machine. Damn. After it beeped, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
said, “Mom! Mom, please be there! This is very important. You have to speak to
me and get Jane out as soon as possible, or at least get a message to her.
Please! Won’t someone pick up? I need you NOW. Please.....” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Hello? <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Daria</span></span><span
class=GramE>?”</span> It was Dad. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Dad?” asked <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> with
trembling relief, “Can I speak with Mom, please? Even if you have to link us.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>? <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>!?
Helen is trying to bust you out right now! We won’t let them put you away, it’s
us against the world, kiddo!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Thanks,” said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, “May I
speak to Mom, please?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Sure! And <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, don’t SAY
anything to anyone until Helen gets there!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Right, Dad.” She didn’t ask for Mom again, because there
was another beep and Helen was on the line. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I got it, Jake,” said Helen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Good talking to you, kiddo,” said Jake. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I feel the same,” said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, I’m so sorry! If you
knew how many people are calling, you’d know why we’re screening our calls now.
Every Tom, Dick, Harry, Mary, Jane, Sue want me to tell them something they
don’t know, which is a lot! Anyway, how are you?” asked Helen. She seemed
happy, if extremely frazzled, to hear from her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> took a couple of seconds to get her thoughts back together.
“Not good, Mom,” she said. “I know how you feel with everyone hammering away at
you, but it’s even worse here. They’re trying everything to get me to talk
about things I didn’t do, and things I just shouldn’t be talking about at all.
They just tried to....” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>!” shouted Helen, “their
phones are monitored! More than one person was convicted for discussing a crime
over their pay phones, so don’t say anything that can be used against you in a
court of law!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Right, Mom.” <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> grimaced.
She hadn’t even thought of that. Still, it’s not like she would say anything
with Sergeant <span class=SpellE>Lanny</span> right beside her. “Anyway, I’m
afraid they might try tricking Jane, and she might not figure out they’re
trying to entrap her before it’s too late.” When there was silence, <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> continued, “Unless you really did hire a Ms. Palmer
to work on our case?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“WHAT!?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> pulled the phone away from her ear, that shriek was so loud.
She put the phone next to her again. “Mom, please don’t do that again. I now
only have one ear left.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Oh, god, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, you didn’t say
anything to her, did you?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Um,” said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> briefly
recalling what she did say, “Nothing that should incriminate me anyway. She
tried to get me to tell lies about Jane, and I knew then she was lying.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“God, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, she’s part of Roger
<span class=SpellE>Fillman’s</span> staff!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Who?” The name sounded familiar. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>“The city attorney.</span></span><span
class=postbody> He’s the one prosecuting you, and he plans to crucify you, <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Well is it legal to say she’s my defense attorney?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“She said that?” asked Helen in a tone of disbelief. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> thought a moment. <span class=GramE>“Um... no, actually.</span>
She just led me to believe she was helping you with my defense. But she never
said she was.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“That bitch!” muttered Helen bitterly. “They’re trying to
get you and Jane to turn against each other. Right now they don’t have enough
on you to make this a sweet enough victory. They need you and Jane to tear each
other <span class=GramE>a part</span>, volunteer information, even lie about
each other just to hurt each other. And then they have you both as sacrifices
for <span class=SpellE>Fillman’s</span> future campaign.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Excuse me?” asked <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. She
was following this until that last line. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>“<span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>.</span></span><span
class=postbody> He plans to crucify you just to make a play at becoming the
next mayor of <st2:City w:st="on"><st2:place w:st="on">Lawndale</st2:place></st2:City>.”
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> felt her lip tremble a little. “Why? Am I that hated that crucifying
me will win someone the election? I mean I know what I did and all, but lives
were in danger, and there was nothing anyone could do about it. I did the only
thing I thought I could do, which was merely a precaution. It was only for a
few days. Another day or two and I would’ve stopped bringing the gun.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“<span class=GramE>It’s</span> okay,” said Helen sounding
furious and compassionate at the same time. “<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,
please understand, this is beyond you. There are several factions that plan to
use you to challenge or uphold certain laws.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> grunted in obvious distress, “You understand, Mom, and anyone
listening in on this call. I’m a person, not a rope to be yanked around like
this for the advancement of career and wealth. This strikes me as evil.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Pretty much,” said Helen.” And it gets worse. <span
class=SpellE>Fillman</span> has exchanged favors with nearly all the detectives
at that station, and has their support. No doubt he promised them a huge budget
if he became mayor, too. Which would....” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen paused, and <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> sensed
Helen thought better of talking about that now. “Look, honey, I’ll explain this
later. You do have friends and you do have help. You’re not alone and we will
get through this. I will get you out as soon as I can, but you are not to talk
to Ms. Palmer.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I know that,” gritted out <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,
“but does JANE know that?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> could sense the light flickering with her mom as she heard the
sudden intake of breath. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,” said Helen quickly, “I
need to call someone right away. I’ll be there to get you as soon as I can. Thank
you for calling me with this information. I love you.” The phone clicked. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> slowly put the phone back in its cradle, feeling alone again.
She tried to make herself feel better by imagining how she could use all this
in a future Melody Powers story, but she desperately wanted her mom to come get
her and Jane out before either one of them finally stepped wrong, allowing the
State to chew them up without mercy, just so people could advance their
political careers. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She was starting to think of the world like that “evil
universe” in that Star Trek video, “Mirror, Mirror.” Only no one admitted that
people advanced themselves by destroying others. They pretended it was all
about justice and the right winning over all. So in this universe, there was
hypocrisy added in with all the other evils. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She barely noticed when she was back in her cell with
Beth. She lay down, hoping that her mom would get her out soon. She couldn’t
even fake a smile when she looked at Beth. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“That bad, huh?” asked Beth. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“That bad,” affirmed <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. She
briefly wished she hadn’t brought the gun, had allowed Matthew to kill Quinn,
and then Matthew would be here now. He deserved this. And then the sheer guilt
of such a thought as wishing Quinn dead so she wouldn’t be here cut her and she
started sobbing. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Beth came up to her and held her, telling her it was going
to be okay. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>When <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> forced herself to
calm down a bit so that she could distance herself from the unwanted contact,
Beth asked, “What did you tell them?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Same as I told you,” said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
in a wavering voice. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Did you tell ‘<span class=SpellE>em</span> where you got
the gun?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“No,” <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> replied, her eyes
going hard but looking away from Beth at that moment. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Man, I’m dying with curiosity where a kid like you got a
gun. I bet your mom got it for you in secret, didn’t she?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> forced out a laugh. “I’m going to lie down for awhile. Wake me
when my mom gets here to bail me out.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Please, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, it’s so boring
here without a TV! Tell me SOMETHING that no one else knows!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> turned back to Beth, a little calmer. “Promise not to tell
anyone?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I promise!” said Beth, sounding sincere. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Ash got it for me at S-Mart.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Ash?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“A guy I met at the local Lackluster Video.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Oh. How did he get you a gun? Did he know what you were
going to do?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> sighed. “You better not tell anyone else what I’m about to tell
you.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I already promised you I wouldn’t!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“All right then. When I told him about Matthew, he got me
a gun since he works Sporting Goods instead of <span class=SpellE>Housewares</span>
now. He told me a gun helped him out in a few bad situations of his own and
gave it to <st2:State w:st="on"><st2:place w:st="on"><span class=GramE>me</span>.</st2:place></st2:State>”
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And he works at S-Mart,” said Beth distractedly. She
shook her head. “I don’t think I’ve heard of <span class=GramE>it</span>.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Shop smart,” said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. “Shop
S-Mart.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Oh, yeah,” said Beth, not sounding sure, “I think I have
heard of it. Wow. Thanks for sharing. I won’t tell anyone! You get some rest
now, okay?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> stared at her a moment longer. “Okay. <span class=GramE>Just so
long as I can trust you.”</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Beth and <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> exchanged
secretive smiles, and then <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> turned over and let
herself go back to sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=postbody>--------------------------------------- </span><br>
<span class=postbody>03/15/01, 3:22 P.M., Thursday </span><br>
<span class=postbody>---------------------------------------- </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen walked in the door, grateful for the curious lack of
reporters outside. Maybe she’d allow herself a glass of something.... soothing.
But first, she needed to talk to Quinn. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Helen!” shouted Jake running down the stairs, “We <span
class=SpellE>gotta</span> bust our girl out of jail! No telling what horrible
things they’re doing to her right now!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Calm down, Jake!” Helen was yelling that a lot lately.
“They’re not doing anything to her.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“That’s easy for you to say!” shouted Jake. “Have you ever
seen Vixens in Chains? That was based on a true story!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Vixens in Chains?” asked Helen mystified. “When did you
see Vixens in Chains? And what was it about? And what was it rated?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jake suddenly looked as if he were a rabbit staring in
some approaching headlights. “Um, I don’t recall,” said Jake in a quiet voice.
Then he raised his voice again, “But we’ve got to get her out before she’s in
there for too long! We don’t want our <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> to become
any more hardened than she already is!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Jake!” shouted Helen, “Calm down! She’s coming home
tomorrow, as soon as we get through the bond hearing.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“But the police are all corrupt, and force people to
confess to crimes they didn’t commit!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Jake,” said Helen with much exasperation, “They’re not
all corrupt, only most of them. They don’t torture anyone to confess, they
trick people with little money, protection, or intelligence into making things
up or seeming to admit to things without realizing what they are saying. <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> is too smart for that, and there are too many eyes on
her, and we have enough money and legal power that they won’t try anything
outrageous with her at all. If they’re smart, they will mind their <span
class=SpellE>p’s</span> and <span class=SpellE>q’s</span> and dot all <span
class=GramE>their <span class=SpellE>i</span></span><span class=SpellE>’s</span>
in triplicate.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Oh, that’s a relief,” said Jake, “they’re too smart to do
anything illegal to <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen bit her lip. Best not to tell him that wasn’t
necessarily true. Besides, part of Helen actually hoped to be able to prove
something just illegal enough to get the entire case thrown out of court. If
she believed in God, she would pray for it. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I think I’ll go take another valium,” said Jake casually
as he headed back upstairs. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“You do that,” said Helen. She’d have to watch him to make
sure he didn’t take too many or start drinking, too. But she had too much to do
right now. She’d deal with Jake later. Maybe have him committed before he drove
her into a nervous breakdown. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She went up the stairs and checked on Jake before going to
Quinn’s door and putting her ear on it. She could make out that Quinn was
actually crying softly in there. She braced herself to be strong and knocked on
the door. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“What?” said <span class=GramE>Quinn.</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen opened the door. She looked around in
surprise--Quinn had her room spotless, orderly, and clean. She’d say something,
but there was something more important to talk about right now. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Quinn,” said Helen calmly and gently, “we need to talk about
something very important.” She braced herself. The last time she said that,
Quinn went on about charges to her credit card she hadn’t known about yet and
to this day she couldn’t recall what she had actually meant to talk to Quinn
about. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn, lying on her bed hugging her stuffed <span
class=SpellE>dino</span>, turned to face Helen and blinked at her through wet
eyes. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Quinn,” said Helen crossing her arms, “where did <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> get the gun?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I... I don’t know,” said Quinn. Helen didn’t have a clue
if she were telling the truth or not. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Quinn,” said Helen calmly, sitting on the bed, “the
police are going to find out. I need to know before they do so I can do all the
damage control I can before <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> is hurt even more.”
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn looked at Helen with such sadness that Helen bent
down hugged her without even thinking about it. “It will be okay, Quinn. We’re
going to get through this.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I really don’t know where <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
got her gun,” said Quinn casually, “you could ask those <span class=SpellE>hoodies</span>
she hangs out with at the Zen.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“The what?” She meant that simultaneously for whatever the
name of that place was again and for what hoodlums <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
hung around. Helen, sitting back up, was staring down at Quinn in shock. Was it
really possible her girls had drifted so far from her that they were both involved
in gangs and drugs without her having a clue? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“The Zen,” said Quinn more firmly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>“When?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Zen.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I mean when was this?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Oh.”</span></span><span class=postbody> Quinn scrunched
up her face in concentration. <span class=GramE>“Oh, yeah.</span> First Friday
of March.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And what was <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> doing at The
Zen?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“<span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and some <span
class=SpellE>hoodies</span> saved me and made Matthew go away. But I don’t know
who they are. When I asked, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> just smiled and
said she’d have to kill me if she told <st2:State w:st="on"><st2:place w:st="on"><span
  class=GramE>me</span>.</st2:place></st2:State>” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I’m sure she was just kidding,” said Helen, desperate to
believe that. <i>I hope by <span class=SpellE>hoodies</span>, she means
sweaters!</i>, but knew that Quinn did not. What she couldn't get over was how
child-like Quinn was acting. She was used to immature, but this was to the
point of age regression. Helen couldn't help but be afraid for her daughter. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yeah,” said Quinn, “I think so, too. But <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> has such a... a face! You can’t really tell with her.
And they were bigger and older than Matthew.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“What did these, uh, <span class=SpellE>hoodies</span>
look like?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Grungy, tattooed, and a fashion sense as razor as <span
class=SpellE>Daria’s</span>.” Quinn’s tone was only a little sarcastic there. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“What was <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> doing with these
<span class=SpellE>hoodies</span>? Do you know?” Helen was getting a bit
panicked as she feared for <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and whatever truth
she might find. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“They seemed to be protecting her, and doing what she said.”
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen narrowed her eyes. “You’re having fun with me,
aren’t you Quinn?” She was going to be really annoyed if Quinn was, but she
still hoped Quinn would break out in giggles or something. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn looked at her with solemn eyes and shook her head
no. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen closed her eyes for a moment and ran her hands over
her face. “Were they involved in drugs in any way?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn scrunched her face in thought. “I don’t know. They
seemed to know where they were and all. Well, <span class=SpellE>sorta</span>.
The one with long hair seemed <span class=SpellE>kinda</span> out of it. But I
don’t keep up with <span class=SpellE>Daria’s</span> friends. They just saved
me from Matthew is <span class=GramE>all.</span>” Her face brightened a little.
<span class=GramE>“Oh, yeah!</span> They were in a band of some kind, because
they had a bunch of instruments in the back of their van.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Oh, Quinn, you didn’t get into a van with them!?” Helen’s
mouth was actually hanging open. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“They gave me a ride home, Mom,” said Quinn defensively.
“Besides, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Jane weren’t scared of them.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen gasped. “Jane was with them?” Then she remembered <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> spent the night at Jane’s the last two Fridays and
Saturdays. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Well, yeah,” said Quinn as if that went without saying,
“Does <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> ever leave the house for any reason other
than to be with Jane?” Quinn sniffled. “And school,” she added as an
afterthought. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen was reaching her limit. “Okay, Quinn, what I want
you to do is tell me why you were in this place, what you know of <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> being there, and what happened. <span class=GramE>From
the beginning.</span> Okay?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn looked at her a little frightened. “Do I have to?”
she asked, like a little girl. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen frowned a little at that voice, getting worried by
it but too focused to get distracted by it. “Yes, Quinn <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>,
you must!” There, now Helen spoke to Quinn as if she were a little girl. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn began crying again. Helen put an arm around her and
told her, “It will be okay, Quinn. But I need to know what happened before it
blows up in all our faces.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>In a voice that sounded like Quinn was 12 rather than 16,
she said, “I was trying to break it off with Matthew, but he wasn’t letting me
break it off.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Why did you want to break it off with him?” asked Helen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>“Mo-<span class=SpellE>oom</span>!</span></span><span
class=postbody> This is about <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“It’s about <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, Jane, you,
Matthew, and these <span class=SpellE>hoodies</span>. Why did you want to break
up with him?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn stared at Helen a moment. Then she looked down.
“Because we had dated way too long.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Quinn,” said Helen warningly, “I want the truth. All of
it.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I am telling the truth!” cried Quinn, “why won’t you
believe me?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Quinn,” said Helen, “there are several detectives and
investigators who are looking into what happened. If I am to protect you, I
need to know now what they will soon know themselves.” When Quinn gazed at her
with fear, Helen said in a gentler voice, “Please Quinn, help me to protect
you. It’s a nasty world out there. I don’t care what you did. What I care about
right now, more than anything else, is protecting my family as best as I can.”
She kissed Quinn’s forehead. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Promise not to ground me?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen choked a bit at that, and fought two reactions at
once: One, to break into a fit of laughter, and the other to leap on Quinn and
yell at her to talk. Finally, she calmly said, “I promise.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Well,” said Quinn, “Sandi had lost 7 pounds on <span
class=SpellE>phen</span> <span class=SpellE>phen</span> and she weighed less
than me, so Matthew gave me some pills that he promised would help me lose even
more weight even faster and...” at this point, Quinn saw Helen’s face and she
put her head forward as she declared, “Mo-<span class=SpellE>oom</span>! I
can’t tell you what happened when you’re looking at me like that!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen swallowed. With every bit of self-control she had,
she did not start screaming. She swallowed again, took in a shaking breath and
asked, “You took some strange pills so you could lose weight?” The last word
was actually hissed more than spoken. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn crossed her arms. “If I’m grounded, I don’t say
another word!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“You’re not grounded,” said Helen. <span class=GramE><i>Yet</i>.</span>
“I’m just trying to comprehend why you and Sandi are competing at who weighs
less than the other..... <span class=GramE>well</span>, never mind. That’s not
important,” she said, thinking <i>For Now</i>. “So Matthew gave you these pills
to lose weight?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yes,” said Quinn cautiously. “Only I couldn’t sleep on
them and I had to go to the bathroom all the time, so I stopped taking them.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen realized her hands were clenched into fists against
the bed and she unclenched them. There, she told herself, it’s not so bad.
“Then what happened?” she asked sweetly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Well, I thought the pills were gifts, you know the way
guys are suppose to buy me stuff and all. He got me a bunch of nice clothes at <span
class=SpellE>Cashman’s</span>, though I had to wear that skimpy suit at the
cabin he got for me from Frederick’s as it was a Valentine’s weekend and... Mo-<span
class=SpellE>oom</span>! Stop making that face!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Sorry, Quinn,” Helen said sweetly as she composed
herself, again. “Tell me everything. I can take it.” The last was to herself
more than to Quinn. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Well, anyway, Matthew wanted me to hold a package for
him. He told me not to open it. I’m like yeah, right, only I didn’t tell him
that. I just took it and told him I’d put it under my bed where no one could
find it. But when I got home, I looked, and it was a bunch more of those pills,
plus a bag full of marijuana, and some white stuff that I wasn’t sure what it
was.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen felt her heart stop for a moment, and then resume
beating. “Drugs,” she stated. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yeah, pretty much,” said Quinn. “Anyway, I told him I
didn’t want to hold his stupid drugs for him <span class=GramE>cause</span> I’d
get really grounded if you found out and he said he was expecting to be busted
soon and he needed to have them somewhere where they wouldn’t think to look,
and if they thought to look there they wouldn’t dare. He said you being a
lawyer and all, they would think twice before they did anything.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I... see,” said Helen, fighting to keep her composure.
“You had all these drugs under your bed, when?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“The week after we got back from the cabin,” said Quinn. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And you were able to recognize the marijuana how
exactly?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“By <span class=GramE>it’s</span> smell, feel, texture,
what else?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen tried again. “How did you learn what marijuana
smells like?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“There was some at a party. It’s kind of hard to miss,
once you know,” she said cautiously. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“You didn’t try any, did you?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Will I get grounded if I say yes?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“That answers my question,” mumbled Helen. “No, you won’t
be grounded just for answering a single question. <span class=GramE>Now how
many times have you tried it?” <br>
<br>
“Oh, only that once.</span> I didn’t really like it, it made me hungry and I’m
scared I’ll get fat. But everyone was doing it, and even though I was scared,
Sandi said we had to be overcome our fears and do the popular thing, and so we
did.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Uh huh,” said Helen. “I see. Have you done any other
drugs?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“No,” said Quinn, “nothing illegal anyway. Just what you
give me, and maybe an aspirin on my worst days.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Ok, then,” said Helen relieved. It could’ve been much
worse<span class=GramE>..</span> “Was there a gun in this stash?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn shook her head. <span class=GramE>“No, just the
drugs.</span> There was a spoon, a spatula, a couple of thin razors like the
kind that Ms. <span class=SpellE>Barch</span> tried to get me to cut up frogs
with, one razor blade in a sheath, some of the tiniest zip lock bags I ever
saw, and some little glass tubes, too. Oh, and some empty pen tubes. You know,
they’re like pens, only the ink part that you write with was taken out. I
couldn’t figure that out, it was so weird.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Oh,” said Helen. “So what did you tell Matthew about the
stash?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I said I didn’t want to hold them for him and he had to
take them back and he kept saying that I only needed to keep it a little
longer, and I said no, and he said I owed him for the pills he gave me and that
he couldn’t take them, and if forced he’d say the drugs were mine and turn me
in and you all would lose the entire house and stuff.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen’s hands clenched into fists again and she unclenched
them. “So you kept them without telling me, right?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Pretty much,” said Quinn. “He said he was going to buy me
a bunch of more stuff after a week or so of my holding them. <span class=GramE>Which
he did.</span> He got pulled over a couple of days later and they didn’t find
anything, or so he said. They even searched his home. They had to let him go
with his mom threatening to sue them. Then he took the package back.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“So did he buy you... stuff?” Helen was beginning to keep
her composure with less effort. She didn’t know if that was a good or bad sign.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yeah,” said Quinn, “I even changed my mind about breaking
up with him because of it, but then he did something no guy should EVER do!”
Quinn quivered in outrage. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen lost her composure and her mouth dropped open. “What
was that?” asked Helen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“He said I demanded too much and now I had to pay him
back! <span class=SpellE>Ooooo</span>! The NERVE of him! I broke up with him
then and there!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Uh, huh,” said Helen swallowing hard after that. “Okay,
then what happened?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“He said that the pills I took were in my system and could
be detected by certain tests, and he’d report me and the police would find I
took the drugs and I’d be tested for them. And that he’d put some pills in my
locker and tell Miss Li he saw me with the pills earlier so she’d find them if
I didn’t give him money, which he said I owed him.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen breathed in and out carefully. “Okay, Quinn, how did
you think you were going to get out of this?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Well, I gave him what I had at the time and promised him
more later,” she said, “and then I went to <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> for
help.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“You went to <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,” repeated
Helen. “Why <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Because <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> is smart, and
while she pretends not to like me and all, I know I can go to her if I’m in
trouble. I mean I do have to pay her and stuff, but she doesn’t make me pay the
way Matthew was doing. She only makes me pay when I need help, and that’s <span
class=GramE>it</span>.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I see,” said Helen, “can’t you come to me, too? I’m free,
you know.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Well, yeah, and I would, except I thought you would
ground me.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen had no response for that. “So what did <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> say to do?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“She told me that what he could do to me, I could do to
him, and I said I didn’t buy him stuff to make him pay me for it. Then she said
no, he could be made to get into trouble for drugs, and I said I don’t have
any, and then she asked me what my excuse was for going with him and then I
said if that’s all the help you’re going to be I’ll take my money back and she
said no, bring him to the Zen on Friday night, and she’d find a way to get rid
of him, but don’t let him know that’s why I want him to take me to the Zen, and
that I should go along with what she said and act as if she’s dangerous, as if
that were hard to remember.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Okay,” said Helen trying not to scream, “so you went to
the Zen with Matthew?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Mm-<span class=SpellE>hm</span>,” nodded Quinn. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And then what happened?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“It turned out he knew the place, and he was surprised I
wanted to go. But he took <st2:State w:st="on"><st2:place w:st="on"><span
  class=GramE>me</span>.</st2:place></st2:State>” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“<span class=SpellE>Daria</span> acted like a total freak,
that’s what! She and Jane came up and were acting like I had to be at home, and
do you know what Dad will do if he catches you with him, and she asked Matthew
if he ever heard of a shotgun wedding.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Jake is a little crazy, but would he believe what <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> was telling him?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Oh, yeah,” said Quinn, “Matthew’s just seen enough of Dad
to say he thought the guy needed a long rest somewhere, and <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
did seem to be freaking him out.” Then she frowned. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“What?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“He got mad at <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Jane
and called them dykes, which might be true, but it wasn’t a nice thing to say.”
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“<span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Jane are dykes!?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Mo-<span class=SpellE>oom</span>! I said it wasn’t a nice
thing to say!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“That was a question, Quinn.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Oh. Um, no, I don’t think so, but you never know. It
would explain a lot.” She shrugged. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen’s hands clenched into fists again and then relaxed
as she let out a breath she had been holding. “Just tell me what happened next,
Quinn.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Oh, ok. Well, Jane said it took one to know one and he
pushed her down, and she jumped back up and he slapped at her, and then there
was this yell, and the <span class=SpellE>hoodies</span> showed up and Matthew
backed off trying to tell them it was okay, and <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
said it wasn’t okay, she hated him and never, ever wanted to see him again
around me or even talking to me or her henchmen would cut him into little
pieces and feed him to their animals, and then Matthew said what we did wasn’t
her business and he grabbed my wrist and....” Quinn broke off as if amazed by
something. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>“And what, Quinn?”</span></span><span
class=postbody> Helen leaned forward, because by the look on her face, she knew
this was important. To herself anyway, Helen thought as she sighed. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“<span class=SpellE>Daria</span> reached for him, and he
pulled his gun out and pointed it in <span class=SpellE>Daria’s</span> face.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“WHAT!?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Mo-<span class=SpellE>oom</span>, don’t shout or I won’t
finish telling you what happened!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen took several deep breaths and then smiled weakly at
Quinn. “Sorry about that,” she said. <span class=GramE>“So Matthew pointed a
gun at <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.</span> Was it the same gun he used at
the school?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yes,” said Quinn, “but it was different because he didn’t
shoot it at anyone. I don’t know why, but I didn’t even think of it as the same
gun until now. I hadn’t forgotten it, it was just different.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Quinn,” said Helen, “What happened next?” She hoped there
wasn’t a shoot-out like the informant said, but <span class=SpellE>Daria’s</span>
odd actions of late were just starting to finally make sense. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn narrowed her eyes a bit as she continued, “Well, I
was staring at <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> then anyway, because her face
was so weird. It was the first time in my life I ever saw <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
so scared, so off guard. Jane was telling Matthew to calm down and I could tell
Jane was scared, too, but I couldn’t take my eyes off of <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,
she just kept staring wide-eyed into Matthew’s gun. I finally realized <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> did not know what to <span class=GramE>do,</span> she
was as clueless as everyone else! And for some reason, that scared me more than
the gun Matthew was pointing in her face, from about a foot away.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn looked up at Helen and saw Helen’s face frozen into
something of a smile, but it didn’t look right for some reason. Her face was
way too red, too. Helen made a “wait a minute” motion with her hand and left.
She heard the front door open and close. And she waited. <span class=GramE>And
waited.</span> <span class=GramE>And waited.</span> After awhile, Quinn put on
some music to listen to while she <span class=GramE>laid</span> back down on
her bed. She felt pretty sure Mom would be back eventually. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Eventually, she noticed Helen standing in the door. “Are
you back?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yes, Quinn, I’m back,” she said, as she came and sat down
beside her. She took a breath. “So Matthew was pointing a gun in <span
class=SpellE>Daria’s</span> face?” Her voice only wavered a little and didn’t
sound as hoarse as she thought it would. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Uh, <span class=SpellE>hu</span>, and <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
was scared. And I couldn’t do anything because I couldn’t stop staring at <span
class=SpellE>Daria’s</span> face that had turned so strange to me.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“So what happened?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“One of the tall <span class=SpellE>hoodies</span>, Jane’s
brother, slowly walked in front of <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and stood
there, and I couldn’t see <span class=SpellE>Daria’s</span> face anymore.
Jane’s brother told him to leave while he still could as if Matthew wasn’t
holding a gun at all. The other <span class=SpellE>hoodies</span> were nearby,
and I think that if Matthew shot anyone, they were going to rush him, but I’m
not sure.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Jane’s brother was one of these <span class=SpellE>hoodies</span>?”
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yes. The one who stayed here with Jane and stayed out
real late the same way I did and you cared more about him staying out than me.”
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Okay, yes, I know who you’re talking about. Jane’s
brother. That makes perfect sense. <span class=GramE>So Matthew was holding a
gun at Jane’s brother who was standing in front of <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.”</span>
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn nodded. “And then I noticed how quiet it was. I mean
it was real quiet. It was so quiet that we could all easily hear a bunch of
cars and motorcycles outside starting up and leaving. But then I saw that other
people inside who had guns. One had a big one like Matthew’s, and another guy
who I think worked there had something that looked like a short rifle. And
another <span class=SpellE>hoodie</span> had a smaller gun in his hand. I could
see this because most of the other people had backed away, going out the doors,
or gotten real low, except for the ones with guns.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Matthew started looking around, and said, everything was
cool, he was just leaving, and the people had tried to stop him from leaving
with his girl. And I said I wasn’t his girl and ripped my arm out of his hand
and ran behind <span class=SpellE>Daria’s</span> friends. Everything got even <span
class=GramE>more quiet</span> and then Matthew ran with his gun still in his
hand. He made it outside, and then we heard another car roar into life and peel
out of there. The guy with the short rifle looked outside and said he thought
he was gone. And then everybody else started leaving, too, and I got in the van
with <span class=SpellE>Daria’s</span> friends.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And you went to Jane’s?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“No,” said Quinn, “I wanted to go home, so they brought me
home. But <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> asked me a bunch of questions about
him. She cried, too, once we were in the van. I haven’t seen her cry in a long
time. Jane cried, too. So did <st2:place w:st="on">I.</st2:place>” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Quinn,” groaned Helen, “why didn’t you tell me when this
happened? I could have done something.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn shrugged. “<span class=SpellE>Daria</span> thought I
should tell you, and I said there were reasons that might not be a good idea,
and besides, he was gone, right? And one of the <span class=SpellE>hoodies</span>
<span class=GramE>were</span> worried that if the police found out, they might
be blamed for threatening him, especially since <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
had me lead him out there. Oh, and they were adults and Matthew was a kid. And
that maybe they’d do something about the Matthew problem themselves, if he even
so much as glared at us, but <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> said something
about trying to get him busted for his drugs, if that was possible, but her
friends said that could get her killed by Matthew or by someone he knows.
That’s what they said.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen gritted her teeth and reminded herself that Quinn
was a child that had just endured a traumatic experience. She decided to just
stick to getting facts for now. “Quinn, this is very important! Did ANY of them
show a gun to you at any time?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn shook her head. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And no shots were fired?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn shook her head again. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And to the best of your knowledge, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
has never had a gun until yesterday?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn nodded. </span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen took long, slow breaths. She finally had found a
little good news. She’d known that the story of <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
being in a gun battle at the Zen couldn’t have been true, just like the other
ridiculous stuff said about her! And the story had grown so much that evidence
would paint the informant as a liar. Now she had to figure out whether or not
to use the information Quinn gave her herself. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Keep going,” Helen said, actually feeling just a tiny bit
better. <i>Just as long as you don’t tell me you’re carrying Matthew’s baby</i>,
Helen silently said with a sudden frown. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>“Um, yeah.</span></span><span
class=postbody> <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and I talked about it on
Sunday, and then Matthew didn’t show up for school at all next week, so we
thought maybe he took a vacation to make sure no one was after him. Jane’s
brother picked me, Jane, and <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> up from school in
a car and drove us home on Monday, but that caused some problems with the
Fashion Club, and I stopped.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And Matthew showed up here the next Monday? The day you
and <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> called 911?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yes,” said Quinn, “I told him I had a date, and he said
he just wanted to talk. I told him I didn’t want to see him or his gun, and he
pulled up his shirt and turned around. It was big enough that if he had it on
him, I would’ve seen it. He might have had it in his car, though.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Or maybe behind a shrub nearby,” said Helen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yeah, that’s possible, too. But he wanted to talk and I
told him that we were through no matter what, and he cried and told me how
sorry he was and he would buy me a bunch of stuff, but I still said no. Then
Matthew got mad, but before he got too loud, Jane yelled out that <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> was calling 911. And Matthew said a bunch of stuff,
threatened to kill <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and break her fingers, and
Jane yelled back. While they yelled, I pulled my phone out and picked it up. <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> really had called 911 and was on the phone saying she
thought he had a gun and I said yeah, and he’s in the house going after Jane
and then <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> got off the phone. But that’s when
Matthew turned and came after me. And you know the rest.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“He caught you, and you both struggled with the phone and
it fell either because you dropped it or he smashed it, and then he hit you,
apologizing right after. Then he ran to his car and left and some police showed
up. Then they said they had him and they called me and I came home and took
pictures of where your face was swelling up.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Pretty much,” said Quinn. “Oh, and he said the police
could arrest him, but they couldn’t keep him.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“The police didn’t find a gun?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I don’t think so. But like he said, the police let him
go.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And that’s everything?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“As much as I can remember.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Okay, Quinn. Who else knows that you kept drugs for
Matthew?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Um... <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Jane, and her
friends in the van.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“What about the Fashion Club?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Nope, not a word,” said Quinn. “Think I’m <span
class=SpellE>gonna</span> tell them where I got my diet pills?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Does anyone other than the two of us know you took some
pills Matthew gave you?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn shook her head. “You’re the first person I told.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Quinn, this is very important. Never, ever tell ANYONE,
at all, that you took his drugs or kept drugs for Matthew. Not on a dare, not
in a game, not as a secret, not anytime to anyone. If anyone asks, you deny it
every single time. If someone says they know, you say they don’t know because
you never did it. You even say that if I ask. Got that?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn nodded her head thoughtfully. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I mean it, Quinn. And it would be a real good idea if you
stayed around the house. I do want to know where you are at all times. And
whatever you don’t, do NOT talk to ANY reporters. Or anyone else you don’t
know. Understand?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn nodded. Helen hugged her for a long time. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>“Mom?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yes?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“When’s <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> getting out?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Soon.</span></span><span class=postbody> I expect her to
be here by tomorrow at the latest.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Good.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“You miss her, don’t you?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn nodded, looking miserable. “And she knows what to
do. I just feel so confused.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen felt almost as she had been slapped. “Quinn,” said
Helen, “I think we all feel confused right now. But I think I have a pretty
good idea of what we should do, too. You should talk to me openly some time and
see.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“But you’re always so busy.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>What Helen hated most about that was it sounded like Quinn
was just stating the obvious. Then she realized what she hated the most about
it was that it was true. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Not anymore,” she said. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn searched her face. “I believe you,” she finally
said. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Good,” Helen replied, “I’ll be back in a little bit.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Where you going?” asked Quinn. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>“To make a call and see someone,
sweetie.”</span></span><span class=postbody> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn frowned but said nothing as Helen walked out. She
was very tired anyway. She held her stuffed <span class=SpellE>dino</span>,
somehow still looking 12 instead of 16.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=postbody>-------------------------------------- </span><br>
<span class=postbody>03/15/01, 6:15 P.M., Thursday </span><br>
<span class=postbody>-------------------------------------- </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite had a lot for Helen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Are you sure the feds are going to wait their turn?”
asked Helen. The feds usually got to go first. Then the state courts got what
was left over. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Looks like it,” said Marguerite. “<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
is actually looking at more time locally, while the BATF <span class=GramE>is
wanting</span> to learn more about where <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> got
her gun from. They’re frustrated, and they know <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
isn’t going anywhere, for the time being.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen really didn’t like to be reminded of everything <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> was facing. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And then there’re the political factors,” Marguerite
added, “The ones wanting to make a name off of this want to do it now. I would
say all indications are the feds will wait until we’re done down here. Then <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> will have to go endure a federal trial.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“That will give me some time to prepare,” said Helen
unnecessarily. “Maybe even some time to help undo those federal laws.” Helen
knew she was wishing, but since she supported these laws before, why couldn’t
she support their repeal now with equal success? “So what’s the status on <st2:Street
w:st="on"><st2:address w:st="on">Jane Lane</st2:address></st2:Street>?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“You should be happy to know,” said Marguerite, “that I
personally got to <st2:Street w:st="on"><st2:address w:st="on">Jane Lane</st2:address></st2:Street>
just as a Ms. Palmer was getting warmed up on her. I said I needed to talk to
her about another case I was thinking of prosecuting, which made everyone else
curious, and maybe even a little nervous.” She smiled. “Guilty conscience, you
know.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Oh,” said Helen. She'd have to remember to call Jane the
first free moment she had. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Anyway, they let Jane go without any real charges. I let
her in on how the dirty world of law and politics really works. Luckily, she
didn’t seem all that surprised by it. She seemed glad to finally make sense out
of it. She’s at home now.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I should be bringing <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> home
tomorrow myself,” said Helen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And then will you finally know the deluge of reporters.”
She pointed at Helen. “You need to get out there and have the press work for
you. Otherwise, it will be <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> alone who shapes
public opinion.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen nodded. “I’m so busy, but you’re right. I’ll have a
real statement prepared by tomorrow.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite nodded, and then cleared her throat. “I’m about
to hand over some papers I want you to look at. But I need you to think like a
lawyer, not a mother.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen closed her eyes. Now what dirty secret was she about
to find out about <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> or Quinn? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I think the sooner you see this, the better. But if
you’re emotionally exhausted, maybe you should wait until tomorrow.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“No, I’m fine,” said Helen, opening her eyes again. “After
talking with Quinn earlier today, I can handle anything.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite seemed very curious but said nothing. She
handed a file over for Helen to look through. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen was confused. There was a file about some illegal
drugs confiscated from Matthew Foster. But she already knew he was a petty dope
dealer. The one thing that made her smile was that every new report showed less
and less money and drugs. She could use that to attack the department, but the
only use to <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> would be if she could blackmail the
department into losing evidence. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“What’s the big deal?” asked Helen. “I know it’s sordid,
but I can use this. Thank you.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Helen,” said Marguerite getting up and coming beside her,
“<span class=GramE>look</span> at the date of the initial police report.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen looked at where Marguerite pointed. She felt fury
build inside her. “March 12, 2001!” Helen quickly found the time of arrest.
5:23 <span class=GramE>P.M..</span> “This was when the police arrested him
right after <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> called 911!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite cleared her throat. “Check the original
charges.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Assault, possession with intent to sell.... illegal
transport of a loaded firearm?” Helen looked up into Mrs. Kramer’s face in
stunned disbelief. “It can’t be.” She looked to where Marguerite then pointed. <span
class=GramE>A Model 608 .357 Magnum revolver.</span> Helen looked up again,
mouth hanging open. “It can’t be,” she repeated. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite nodded her head. “The same weapon Matthew would
try to murder Quinn <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span> with less than 48
hours later, shooting Michael Mackenzie and Ms. Li in the process.... and
possibly destroying <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer’s</span>
future, when she saved her little sister, after 911 failed to do so.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite was startled when Helen leaped up screaming,
“DAMN THEM TO HELL, MARGUERITE, DAMN THEM ALL TO THE STINKING PITS OF HELL
WHERE THEY’LL ROLL IN THEIR OWN SHIT FOR ETERNITY!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Helen,” said Marguerite soothingly as she tried to calm
her own breathing, “think about this in terms of.....” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“WHY!? Why in the name of all that’s reasonable did they
let him go!? <span class=GramE>And...</span> <span class=GramE>and</span>....”
Helen sat back down and broke into sobs. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Why?” asked Marguerite, “Because budgets are getting
harder to come <span class=GramE>by.</span> The various law enforcement
services...” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“You...Call...This... SERVICE!!??” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Uh, various departments,” said Marguerite, trying to keep
her own voice calm so as to inspire Helen to calm her own self down, “are
practically in open competition for dwindling funds. One of the most valued
score cards is how much money’s worth of illegal drugs a department takes off
the streets. After arresting Matthew Foster, petty teenage dope dealer that he
is, Narcotics gave him an offer he couldn’t refuse. No doubt they lied
somewhat, promised him prison, though that would be difficult to press on a
16-year-old. His only chance, he was told, was to give them someone bigger.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen stopped sobbing, but the tears continued to pour.
From her clenched fists and teeth showing, Marguerite knew these were tears of
rage of the worst sort. So she spoke the next part to Helen as soothingly as
possible. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“After taking his money and at least most of his drugs,
they left him his weapon because they believed he would give it to <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>, who would
then be busted for having an illegal firearm, if nothing else, and then they
would lean on <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> to open the way for the police to
make one of the biggest busts in the State of Virginia, ever.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I don’t understand,” said Helen mystified, “and they
never should’ve believed it.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“They didn’t. At first they thought he was trying for
revenge against the three girls that essentially called 911 to come get him. I
personally believe they were right the first time.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen was taking deep breaths. “So,” said Helen in a crisp
matter, “what changed their little minds?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“While holding Matthew, they had a narcotics officer check
some of his contacts. One informant claimed that Matthew had showed up at the
Zen unexpectedly. He appeared to show up with a perky, red hair high school
girl who practically dragged him in front of two other high school girls,
slightly older, one wearing glasses, who began to openly chastise him about
something he could not overhear due to background noises.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen moaned and put her face into her hands. How did <span
class=SpellE>Daria’s</span> plan get so royally screwed up? She was getting
over her tears finally. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite put her hand on Helen’s shoulder. “It was
apparent that words were exchanged. Several people came to the aid of the two
older high <span class=SpellE>schoolers</span>. Then Matthew Foster pulled a
big gun, and the people did not back down, which is how he knew these people
were hard core. He said that Matthew shoved that .357 right in <span
class=SpellE>Daria’s</span> face and she didn’t even flinch. It was Matthew who
looked scared. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>&quot;Then several people, a dozen he guessed, pulled guns
out of their own and all pointed them at Matthew Foster. The last thing he saw
before getting out the door was Quinn, apparently, pulling herself away from
Matthew with her nose stuck in the air and getting behind <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.”
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite stopped talking because while Helen was still
crying, but she was laughing now, too. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Helen?” asked Marguerite timidly, “are you okay?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I don’t know,” wheezed Helen in a tone that contained
both laughter and sobbing, “just keep talking.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yes,” said Marguerite, “the informant claimed to hear
gunfire as he was leaving, and then saw Matthew Foster driving past him well above
the speed limit. It was his assumption he finally shot the girl with the
glasses, or maybe he shot one of the people that did her bidding.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“God,” whispered Helen. She seemed to be fighting
hyperventilation. “You’re not going to believe what really happened...” Then
she shook her head. “First, tell me why they then let Matthew go with his
weapon.” Helen was regaining control of herself. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite sighed and sat back down. “Well,” she began,
“since descriptions, including photos of Quinn and some older photos, were
freshly available, they were able to confirm that the girls were indeed <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Quinn <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>,
going so far as to show the <span class=SpellE>polaroid</span> of Quinn gained
on Monday to the informant on Tuesday. And many, including the informant,
recognized <st2:Street w:st="on"><st2:address w:st="on">Jane Lane</st2:address></st2:Street>.
It was assumed that an emergency matter of drugs were being discussed in secret
at the Zen.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Excuse me?” asked Helen. “Aren’t police <span
class=GramE>suppose</span> to be psychologically screened?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite smiled slightly at that. “Matthew told police
that Jane and <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> answered to someone higher whom
Matthew did not know. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> gave the drugs to Quinn
who passed them onto Matthew. When police raided him before, he somehow was
aware--which indicates a leak in the department, by the way--and he claimed he
gave his entire stash back to Quinn who handed them back to <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.
<span class=SpellE>Daria</span> would then pass them up to someone who was
supposed to be highly respected in the community on both sides of the law.
Matthew hinted that this person was wealthy and was also the reason why he knew
when to hide the drugs just before Narcotics tried catching him again.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And they trusted Matthew?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“No! They held him in jail until Wednesday morning, just
before the shooting. Then the Lawndale PD literally dropped Matthew off at his
house on the morning of the shooting with the understanding he was going to
head to Lawndale High, which Matthew assured them was ‘neutral ground where
nothing could go wrong,’ and as soon as possible to smooth things over with <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> and her criminal connections.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen groaned. “Why?” she muttered. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Because they were blinded by greed and the thought of
making one of the largest drug busts in the history of the <st2:State w:st="on"><st2:place
w:st="on">Virginia</st2:place></st2:State>.” She smiled sardonically here.
“Apparently, from other sources, they deduced that <span class=SpellE>Daria’s</span>
connection was the Sloane family. Which they think was given to her by <st2:Street
w:st="on"><st2:address w:st="on">Jane Lane</st2:address></st2:Street>.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen shook her head. “It wasn’t like that at all. <span
class=GramE>And so what?</span> How is hurting <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
suppose to hurt the <span class=SpellE>Sloanes</span>?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“With Matthew’s help, they planned to bust and entrap <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> with the gun, and then lean on her to entrap the <span
class=SpellE>Sloanes</span>.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen gaped. Then she laughed. And then she just shook her
head. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“They hoped the final bust would be such a mother lode,”
said Marguerite slowly, “as to make national headlines. And not only save their
budget, but increase it, once they were declared heroes. That doesn’t include
all the Sloane estates and assets that would be confiscated under the seizure
laws used in the war on drugs.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen’s jaw dropped. Even she was impressed by the gall to
take such a huge prize. That was ambition! And, if done just right, it could
actually work! Then she shook her head. “The <span class=SpellE>Sloanes</span>
are too wealthy....” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Not if they get busted with drugs on their property. Like
many organized crime families, many of which are bright enough to keep their
properties in other names, the <span class=SpellE>Sloanes</span> are wealthy
enough to keep offshore accounts and unlisted properties with ease. This could
all be used to hide a drug smuggling operation. And all that could be found
would be forfeit if they could create an ironclad case against the <span
class=SpellE>Sloanes</span>. Essentially, they’d become paupers overnight. And
if it works the way some other cases have in <st2:country-region w:st="on"><st2:place
w:st="on">America</st2:place></st2:country-region>, many of them might not
even survive the raid.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And if <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> refused to
cooperate?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite shrugged. “They’d still have a bigger bust than
Matthew, or so they thought. And they’d just keep Matthew, too, I expect. I
mean we’re not talking about honorable people, here. They still came out better
for the risk, even if it didn’t hand them the <span class=SpellE>Sloanes</span>
the way they hoped it would.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“If they thought they had what they needed but made even
the slightest misstep,” said Helen in absolute amazement at such audacity,
“they could find themselves effectively without jobs, and possibly even severe
legal problems of their own that not even a police badge could hope to save
them from. All of them.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Oh, don’t think it hasn’t happened before. Stuff like
this is on the increase. Donald Scott, from the evidence available, was shot in
cold blood in his own home in 1992 by agents of several law enforcement
agencies for his multi-million dollar ranch in <st2:place w:st="on"><st2:City
w:st="on">Malibu</st2:City>, <st2:State w:st="on">California</st2:State></st2:place>.”
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen shook her head. “That couldn’t happen in <st2:country-region
w:st="on"><st2:place w:st="on">America</st2:place></st2:country-region>. It
just couldn’t.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Oh, but it did, and it’s happened again since then.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Okay, so what was he charged with?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Charged?” asked Marguerite, “He wasn’t charged with
anything. They never were. The bulk of the intelligence gathering involved
financial reports and property assessment done by the local tax assessors, and
some other agents from helicopters. They made some noise about investigating
marijuana plants, but not one reason is given, nor do the aerial photographs
support such a claim. And even this noise is dropped as soon as they confiscate
the property without even charging anyone. It’s happened to a lot of people,
and many of them had police and federal agents scope out neighborhoods
disguised as reporters or some such asking about the equity of the homes. What
happened with the Scotts is not unique.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“That’s just plain robbery,” said Helen disbelieving. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And in the Scott’s case, it was murder, too. While
Frances Scott was begging for her life from the ninjas that broke down her
door, Donald Scott came to his wife’s defense with a gun, not even guessing
that these people were police officers of various departments. The officers
told him to drop the gun that he had pointed at them. <span class=GramE>When he
finally did, they open-fired on him.</span> He died. Then his body was removed
and they set about disposing of the ranch and splitting the loot.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Why isn’t that national news?” asked Helen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Good question. But it’s easy enough to find articles and
news clips about it, and other cases like it. I guess it doesn’t get picked up
because it’s too scary. If they’ll do that to a multimillionaire, they’ll do it
to the rest of us. And they do.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“You know,” said Helen, “I recall reading something, years
ago, 1998 I think, about Patty Hearst trying to get a pardon. She had a box
dropped on her step with a number on top. She dialed the number without
touching the box and when no answer came, she called the local police to pick
the package up. Local police got there moments before the DEA did. The package
was full of drugs. If Patty hadn’t called, you and I would be convinced she was
in prison for drug crimes. And what sticks with me is that it was nothing more
than a small article in People which was considered AMUSING. But I thought it
was terrifying!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And nothing came of it, either, right?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen shook her head, “The DEA refused to give any
comments, and it was forgotten. It never was big news. I’m starting to remember
others like that.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite added, “And virtually nothing was done to the
murderers in <st2:City w:st="on"><st2:place w:st="on">Malibu</st2:place></st2:City>,
either. Not even a slap on the wrist or a demerit on their record.” She shrugged.
“Years later, surviving relatives were paid around five million dollars in
reparations, but that was paid for by the tax payer, not the murderers, some
whom are probably still cops.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen looked at Marguerite. “And you think that the <span
class=SpellE>Sloanes</span> may be next?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“What I’m saying,&quot; said Marguerite with emphasis,
&quot;is that it would be naive to think that the situation, which the evidence
here very strongly suggests, is somehow impossible. Even worse has happened
before with few negative consequences for the guilty.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen wondered if the next Matthew her family faced would
be sworn to uphold the law. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I do have to say, though, they are hoping for some kind
of drugs to show up. They want that bust. I doubt they’ll do anything without
it. But as dirty as they’ve played so far, just how much dirtier will they get
before they decide to give up on it?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen looked down, saying in a low voice, “I honestly
don’t know anymore.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“In the process,” Marguerite paused until Helen looked
back up, “if it succeeded, it also bolsters the reputation of the city
attorney, Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>, in his bid for mayor. It
also proves to the people watching the news that Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>
is not a friend to the wealthy, which will gain him many votes. If we didn’t
know better, even we’d vote for him after he proved himself willing to punish
the rich who break the law.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen began to feel ill. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And incidentally, he gains his revenge on the only lawyer
that hurt his career, and no doubt would stand in the way of his rise to power.
Anything you said against him would automatically be discredited.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen shook her head. “But if these officers screw it up,
then Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> will be disbarred for sure. <span
class=GramE>At the very least!”</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite shrugged. “If the officers screw it up, I’m sure
he’d be happy to lead the proverbial lynch mob against them, too. He still
shows himself the champion of the little people.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>Helen half-snarled, half-snorted.</span></span><span
class=postbody> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite crossed her arms. “<span class=GramE>Which is
another motive the police now have in fearing you.</span> <span class=GramE>And
me.</span> I’m going to use this to indict some people, possibly even police
officers and Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> himself if I think I stand
even a small chance of making it stick. And I’m scared to do it, Helen. But I’m
even more scared not to do <span class=GramE>it</span>.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Are you saying,” asked Helen who was still trying to
assimilate all this, “that this is greed and political ambition, and revenge?
That this is the reason they dropped Matthew off at Lawndale High?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite clarified, repeating a little of what she said
earlier. “He was released from the station at roughly 7 am on the morning of
the shooting and given transportation to his home so he could get into some
proper clothes and presumably restore his esteem in the eyes of the Sloane drug
lord lieutenant, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>,
and entrap her in the process.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“So what was Matthew’s angle in this?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“My guess is that the first conclusion by the officers was
correct. Matthew wanted revenge against those who <span class=SpellE>sicced</span>
the police on him and finally caused him to be busted with the drugs they long
knew he had but had been unable to prove. He made the keystone cops of
Narcotics believe that the 911 call was the blessing the department
needed.&quot; </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>&quot;Why didn't they stop him when he started killing
people?&quot; Helen's voice started to break again. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>&quot;They had no <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>tac</span></span>
teams on the scene, but they did have surveillance. By the time it had warped
into the tragedy at Lawndale High, with students and faculty running out of the
school screaming in terror, it was too late except to pick up what pieces were
left and carry on. Not to mention covering their own butts.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“The reason they let Matthew have the gun?” Helen was
close to tears again, but still holding strong. “<span class=GramE>I’m still
not understanding</span> that part.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Matthew needed the gun for his own revenge. But the
explanation Matthew told the police was he needed the gun to hand to <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> on the ‘safe ground’ of Lawndale High, as the gun
belonged to a cohort of hers and she wanted it back, but would be hostile to
him if he went to her elsewhere. Once she had it back, the police would take
her with it, and she would be where she is now, only being pressured to entrap
the <span class=SpellE>Sloanes</span> instead of being pressured to confess to
crimes other than the crime of saving her sister’s life.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Why would <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> want the gun
back, and where would she have gotten it from?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Where did <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> get the gun she
had?” returned Marguerite. “Matthew claimed he won it as part of some gambling
pot, fair and square.” She laughed, shaking her head. “That was what the fight
was about at the Zen. He didn’t want to give the gun up after he had just
rightfully won it.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And if all this were true, why would <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
call 911?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“As of Monday, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> told
Matthew that she would forgive Matthew for pulling the gun on her if he
surrendered his gun to her to give to her connection who wanted it. He refused,
and Quinn tried to take it until he knocked her aside, bruising her cheek. And
they used the 911 facade as it was believable, and he would finally be busted. <span
class=GramE>A fitting punishment for defying <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
and Quinn <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>.</span> Not to mention <st2:Street
w:st="on"><st2:address w:st="on">Jane Lane</st2:address></st2:Street>, also on
the scene, and reported at the Zen, and the one who introduced <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> to the <span class=SpellE>Sloanes</span>.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen crossed her arms. “I don’t understand how Matthew
knew enough about the <span class=SpellE>Sloanes</span> to implicate them in
this bluff of his.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“It was the police that made that connection, and one of
the police officers that talks to me said Detective Warner asked Matthew some
leading questions,” said Marguerite. “What opened the possibility of a Sloane
being the secret connection used by <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> to
Detective Warner were photos taken by a vice cop, whom I assume was bored. Take
a look.” </span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite passed Helen four photos. One was out on her
sidewalk of <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Tom speaking with Quinn and
Matthew. None of them seemed particularly pleased to be speaking together, and
Quinn was looking over her shoulder as if worried someone might see them
together. The other three were taken at Pizza King, where Quinn and Matthew
were standing by a table, looking down on <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and
Tom. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“So these are the reasons Warner said I would be aware of
soon, right after they roughed up <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> right in
front of me! They treated her like she was <span class=SpellE>Scarface</span>!”
Helen was feeling her temper rise again. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite nodded. “It was deemed insignificant at the
time, but in light of new facts they believed they possessed, the pictures took
on a new, ominous meaning to Detective Warner.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“It’s not enough,” said Helen. “We’ve got more
circumstantial evidence on them than they do on those four kids.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite continued. “Then the informant who witnessed
the altercation at the Zen describes the same young man with <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Jane in the past. He claimed there had obviously
been friction there in the past between this Sloane and <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
and Jane that he thought was a romantic entanglement of some kind, but that
they still seemed to work together anyway. With the recent event the informant
described, Detective Warner wondered if this wasn’t a romantic entanglement but
a business entanglement.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“So Matthew was asked some leading questions? What, did
they WANT it to be true?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Of course they wanted it to be true, Helen.” She shrugged
then. “How do you think con-artists make so much <span class=GramE>money.</span>
They promise things like this all the time, and usually the victim is blinded
by his or her own greed from seeing the <span class=SpellE>looniness</span> of
it all. And this is what is going on here; more greed and ambition than common
sense.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen shook her head. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite continued. “In this case, Detective Warner
asked him about Tom Sloane, and Matthew said that was the connection to the <span
class=SpellE>Sloanes</span>, but he didn’t know anything about them. He claimed
<span class=SpellE>Daria</span> kept it a secret from him.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I’m just stunned,” said Helen, “that they would jump to
that conclusion.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“As of Tuesday night, <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>
was contacted by Detective Warner, and by Wednesday morning, they had set a
plan into motion that has resulted in yesterday’s.... incident.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Unbelievable,” said Helen in something like shock. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Well it’s not only greed, and the political ambition of
Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>, but there is an apparent leak in the
department to many petty dope dealers like Matthew. The dope dealers seem to
know when to make themselves clean or when to leave town.” She shrugged. “They
probably thought <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Jane have the same
connections Matthew did. And they hope to find that connection through them, in
addition to making the biggest bust ever.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Amazing,” murmured Helen, still trying to assimilate the
twisted motives and what she had just discovered both her daughters had been
doing on their own as of late. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Another thing,” said Marguerite, as she pulled out an old
file. “While I was looking into Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>, I got
a little nostalgic and dug up the legal file in which you nearly disbarred <span
class=SpellE>Fillman</span>. You said a private investigator had been the one
to prove it and you made it stick?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yes,” said Helen wondering what this had to do with
anything. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite handed her the file. “Take a look at who hired
the private investigator.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen looked a bit, smiling a bit as she recalled just how
passionate she had been on this case. And then she felt her insides twist and
goose bumps crawl over her as she found the information on the private
investigator. Looking up to Marguerite, she exclaimed, “He was hired by Andy
Sloane!” She had completely forgotten that. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite nodded. “Tom Sloane’s uncle. He was just
protecting an investment by doing so, not from any idealistic reasons, but it’s
still a slight Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> hasn’t forgotten or
forgiven.” She shrugged. “And he might consider the <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffers</span>
and the <span class=SpellE>Sloanes</span> to be people who would threaten his
political ambitions. And that your two families now seem close together because
of the unlikely match of Tom Sloane and <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> <span
class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>, well, it may spook him just a little.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Add paranoia to greed and ambition,” Helen muttered. Then
she swallowed hard and closed the file. “And Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>
not only hopes to become the mayor of <st2:City w:st="on"><st2:place w:st="on">Lawndale</st2:place></st2:City>,
but endorsed Matthew’s release with the intent to avenge himself against me by
destroying both of my daughters?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite simply nodded, “Not in the way it almost
happened, but essentially, yes.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I think I’m going to be sick.” Helen got up. “I mean it.
I think I am.” Helen really did look ill as she quickly walked to the bathroom.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Everything that happened was starting to make sense to
Helen. The fast and zealous responses, the seizing of Jane on the flimsiest of
evidence, the heavy handed, even risky, tactics of the police used on anyone
connected to the case. They were desperate to not only cover their own pathetic
butts, but to salvage what they could out of the situation, which was no small
prize for them all. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She HAD to get <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> out of
their clutches. And she had to prepare Quinn. They'd come for Quinn. She knew
it. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She didn’t get sick, but she did cry tears of rage and
fear and pain. Then she washed her face and she returned. As she got close to
her chair, Marguerite was looking at some more reports and spoke without
looking up. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“If you’re interested in reading the autopsy reports,
you’ll see he had a high concentration of methamphetamines in his system at the
time of death. He probably had some in his system when he went to see Quinn. He
may have had enough chemically induced hubris to think it would work from the
beginning.” She shrugged. “People have fallen for worse cons. <span
class=GramE>Especially</span> if they think they’re going to get some
significant windfall out of it.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen's voice was weak, but seemed devoid of tears. “And
his goal was not only to kill Quinn, but <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and
Jane?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“That’s my guess,” said Marguerite. <span class=GramE>“Unless,
of course, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> really is a criminal mastermind.”</span>
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>They both laughed, though Marguerite noticed Helen laughed
rather weakly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“After that,” said Marguerite, “He probably intended to
kill other students, but I would guess he intended to kill a few police
officers, too.” Marguerite cleared her throat and continued. “He got the extra
ammo after he was dropped off at his house. The bullets he put in his pocket
suggest that he was prepared to reload two more times and then use the last
bullet in one chamber to kill himself, should he get separated from his
backpack.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> and Detective
Warner have to know we’ll find out.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Oh, yes,” said Marguerite, “that’s why they’re hurrying
to find truth to their claims, or at least make a solid case against <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>. It’s also possible that if the situation gets hot
enough, they intend to trade <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> for your silence.”
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen’s mouth dropped open. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Helen,” said Marguerite, “there are at least two police
officers willing to risk their careers and testify. I will bring charges
against Warner. Even if they have <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> at their
mercy, we may soon have Warner at ours. And with it, the bright future <span
class=SpellE>Fillman</span> expects for himself.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen clenched her fists again. “<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
is my first priority. But if we can get <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and
then burn them, Marguerite, let’s burn them before they ever do anything like
this again!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“My thoughts exactly,” said Marguerite. “Any luck in
finding out where <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> got her gun?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen shook her head slowly, relaxing her hands. “No, but
I got a lead. I think.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“But you know something you didn’t before.” It was a
statement more than a question. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yes,” said Helen. “With your permission, I’d like to go
over these reports before I divulge what I’ve found out on my own.” She smiled
apologetically. “It’s even possible I can clear up all the misunderstandings.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite raised her brows. “THAT would be something I’d
like to hear, when you care to share it. I’ll even promise not to repeat it if
you want, as long as it doesn’t require me to stay silent about ongoing serious
criminal activities.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I expect I will share it with you soon,” said Helen. “And
I thank you for all your help.” Helen got up. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Wait, Helen,” said Marguerite, “I’ve got more for you.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I hope my nerves can handle it,” muttered Helen as she
sat back down. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite opened a drawer and pulled out a large envelope
and pulled out several photos. “Do you know this place?” she asked, pulling out
police photographs of what looked like an old, dated cabin by a small lake. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen flipped through the pictures. “It looks like some
old cabin that has seen better days to <st2:State w:st="on"><st2:place w:st="on"><span
  class=GramE>me</span>.</st2:place></st2:State>” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yes,” she said. “Originally built as a cabin around the
turn of the 20th century, it has been passed down from family member to family
member for three generations, counting Matthew’s father, Jim Foster, as the
current owner after his father died two years ago. It’s also the cabin Matthew
took Quinn, too.” Marguerite handed her some more photos. “Now take a look at
these,” she said. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>More photos of inside the cabin and what looked to be a
cellar. <span class=GramE>And guns.</span> <span class=GramE>Lots of guns.</span>
Helen looked up at Marguerite with an ill expression on her face. “How did the
girls not know?” she asked weakly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Well if they spent most of their time skiing on the hill
as they claim, I doubt they would unless Matthew showed them off. The guns were
mostly kept in the cellar, with a few stashed in cases in other places. Now
take a look at these.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen felt her gut clench when she saw several photocopies
of excerpts from papers that were obviously racist in nature. Judging by the
headlines and inscriptions by the pictures, these were “reports” that defied
description. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>One had stories of Communist Russian troops waiting in
underground bunkers and behind the Mexican border to invade during the supposed
Y2K madness. Another described underground UN bases and their black helicopters
hidden in national forests. Another told you which politician was a Jew, and
warned of the “Zionist Occupied Government.” Another had a bunch of Nordic
runes on it and she recognized the editor as the guy who was <span class=GramE>suppose</span>
to have written The Turner Diaries. Another had a crude drawing of 3 skulls
showing a “white man,” a “black man,” and a “gorilla.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen threw them back on Marguerite’s desk. “Matthew’s?”
she asked weakly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“No,” said Marguerite. <span class=GramE>“Jim Foster’s.</span>
Apparently he kept the cabin as a place where he planned to bolt to when the
race war began or the ZOG came for him or whatever he thought was going to
happen. He’s not talking much. We don’t know how much Matthew was involved in
this, but it appears there was a lot of friction between Matthew and his
father. We don’t have details because Jim’s not talking and Matthew’s dead.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“You’ve arrested him then?” asked Helen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“You better believe it,” she said, “right after he
threatened to kill several officers. As I told you, he’s barred from owning
guns because of a restraining order. He led us to believe that he had sold all
his guns to friends, at a gun show, and even at a pawn shop. He showed us
receipts. We’re now in the process of tracking down the people who signed those
receipts, though it seems only a few used their real names. Most of those folks
really do have the guns the receipts show them buying, though we think in those
cases, he traded guns with them.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I never would’ve guessed,” muttered Helen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Oh, the press will learn about this soon. This is going
to be huge news. The circus out there is going big time. But don’t believe it
when they warp it into Matthew trying to start a race war. All indications are
that Matthew hated his father and was ashamed of him.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“But he shot Ms. Li and Mack,” said Helen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite sighed. “We can find no evidence that Matthew
was even racist. The shootings of Michael Mackenzie and Angela Li seem to have
been because they interfered with him, not because of their race.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She made a look of disgust and looked up at Helen.
“Unfortunately, that’s not stopping all the so-called watchdog groups from
publicly claiming otherwise, nor the press from reporting such untruths. And
you’re not going to like this.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“What?” asked Helen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Within minutes of these photocopies being made, they were
sent to my office at the behest of Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>.
John Dees, who must have learned of this from <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>
since it is not public knowledge, called me an hour later and asked me about
suing you and your family for the involvement of Quinn and <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
in helping with this race war Matthew was supposedly trying to start.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Damn him anyway,” said Helen. She can’t believe she once
admired that con-artist. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I told him where he could stick that offer, and made it
clear to him that your entire family would get a lot of minority support if he
tried that.&quot; She shrugged. &quot;Mr. <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> may
have even hope to bribe me to join his side by using Dees to win a lot of
money, some of which could go to me for my, uh, services.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“So when does this sideshow open up for the public?” asked
Helen, noting a cynicism in her own voice that would impress <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Everything is to be returned to the cabin first thing
tomorrow morning,” said Marguerite, “where it will be set back up, and then a
press conference will be called. Then you won’t hear the end of it. I suspect <span
class=SpellE>Fillman</span> hopes that the sins of Jim Foster will bleed onto
Matthew’s memory, and from that, onto your daughters. <span class=GramE>At
least Quinn.”</span> She shook her head. “I just hope they can’t make Jim
Foster slander your daughters for a promise of getting out of prison.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen gritted her teeth as she realized just how dirty
this fight was going to get. “But if Matthew and his father were estranged,
then how did Matthew get to use the cabin?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“His father was visiting relatives in <st2:State w:st="on"><st2:place
w:st="on">Florida</st2:place></st2:State> that weekend,” she said. “Or so he
says. For now.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“But Matthew got the gun from his father, right?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite sighed. “No.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Do you think he got it from a gun show or from his drug
connections?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“No.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen blinked. “You know?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“The gun belonged to his maternal grandfather. He collects
guns, too, though he’s much more discrete about it. And he has no known
connections to the kinds of groups that Jim Foster seems to have had.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“So Matthew stole it from him?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“No,” sighed Marguerite, “it gets more complicated than
that.” She smiled when she saw Helen roll her eyes at that proclamation. “As I
said, Matthew’s mother, Mary Walker Foster, had a restraining order against her
that barred her from having guns. Since she does have a history of violence,
stalking, mental illness, and drug abuse, it wasn’t hard to have one granted.
Personally, I thought the world better off if both of those people didn’t have
guns.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“So how did Matthew get it?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Mary Walker Foster had it given to her by her own father,
John Walker. He was picked up for interrogation after the shooting. When he
heard he and his family might be liable for damages Matthew caused to Mr.
Mackenzie and Ms. Li, he broke and said he’d given it to his daughter because
she had to have it to defend herself from her ex-husband. Mary Foster refutes
this, of course.” Marguerite shook her head at that. “Loves his daughter enough
to give her a gun in secret, but willing to throw her to the dogs when he
thinks he might lose what he has if he doesn’t.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Well,” said Helen, “her ex-husband does sound dangerous.”
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Actually,” said Marguerite, “he seemed more dangerous to
himself than anyone else. He might’ve gotten too drunk and shot someone, but
he’d just as likely have shot himself or wrecked his car. His plan was to hide,
not fight back. In the last few years after the divorce, they’ve pretty much avoided
each other, even when he skips on child support payments.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen made a noncommittal sound. “So Matthew got the gun
from his mother?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Perhaps,” replied Marguerite, “but John Walker knew of it
and bought the ammo.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen muttered in amazement under her breath before
asking, “What did he think Matthew wanted with that many bullets?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Target practice,” Marguerite said. Then she added in a
John-Walker voice, “Like I did when I was a boy. Builds character.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Does it put hair on your chest, too?” asked Helen with a
grin. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite smiled back more warmly. “Keep your sense of
humor, Helen. You’re going to need it.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Just out of curiosity, what’s the NRA saying, now that
it’s found Matthew used a legally purchased gun and ammo to do his shooting
spree?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Oh, they point out his mother shouldn’t have had the gun
to begin with, even though they’re against the restraining orders being used to
take guns away. They say if the laws had been enforced, Matthew would not have
been able to do what he did.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen rolled her eyes. <span class=GramE>“The nerve of
them.”</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite smiled cynically. “Well, the weakness of their
argument is just as weak as the arguments of Handgun Control Inc. None of their
laws helped, either. The laws favored by HCI and the NRA have not done a damn
thing to stop what Matthew intended to do.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen looked at her friend quizzically. “<span
class=GramE>You changing</span> sides?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite laughed. <span class=GramE>“Hardly.</span>
Maybe I’m inventing a new side. <span class=GramE>One that believes in justice
over politics.</span> And that maybe most morality and legislation should be
two completely separate components of our society.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen cocked her head a bit, some concern on her face.
“Are you okay? You sound depressed.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite sighed. “I guess you could say that I’m looking
at the games we keep playing with each other and wonder if we can’t learn to
play a better game. None of us seem to be building the kind of world we want,
only a world of endless conflict over rules and games that don’t make a
difference anyway.” She frowned. “What’s going on now seems so pointless that
I’m actually thinking of quitting law and politics and just finding some nice
remote area to retire in.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen reached over and clasped Marguerite’s arm. “I may
move out there with you, Marguerite Kramer, but before you give up, let’s see
if we CAN make a difference one last time.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>They exchanged a friendly smile, and for a moment, they
both saw the passionate, caring young people they had once been before they
sold out and called it “wising up” and got used to compromising more and more
of their values to get ahead in their careers. Maybe they wouldn’t drop out
just yet. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“We’ve got our work cut out for us, though, don’t we,”
said Marguerite, her voice becoming more normal. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“That we do,” said Helen. “Maybe we should get HCI to do
gun control for the police and leave everyone else alone.” She almost laughed
as she said it. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Maybe we should,” murmured Marguerite seriously. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“One thing’s for sure,” said Helen, trying to get the
conversation back to the practical details, as dirty as they were, “this case
is going to make for some strange bedfellows.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite nodded and said, “Have you thought about just
how the NRA and HCI are equally at a stalemate in this case?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen raised her brows. “How so?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“The NRA can’t champion legalizing <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
having a gun in her circumstances without essentially championing Matthew’s
right to do the same. And HCI can’t really point out that there were two
wounded and the only dead was the <span class=SpellE>perp</span> himself
without pointing out that it was a gun--one she was barred from having by the
same gun control laws that restricted Matthew and <span class=GramE>his
immediate family from owning his gun--that saved several more lives</span>.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen grimaced. “I wonder how many of them will even think
of <span class=GramE>it</span>.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“An extreme position might do it, but that hardly paints a
pleasant picture. You restrict all guns, and pretty soon only criminals and the
government has them. More often than not, you can’t tell the difference between
them then. And even when the government appears benevolent, it can always
change.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“But wouldn’t the opposite lead to shoot-outs all the
time, like in the Wild West?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Sometimes. Thing is on that, most of the places where
shoot-outs were common had a lot of young men, a lot of alcohol, and a lot of
money, such as a mining town. Where there was a lot of money, gambling and
criminals followed. And some of those places had gun control laws of their own.
And not all of these places were violent.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen raised her brows. “You don’t think it would lead to
violence then?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I don’t know, Helen. Maybe society would be more polite,
and you’d have less people cutting you off on the highway or yelling at
you.....&quot; </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen prompted her to continue with, &quot;Or?&quot; </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>&quot;Or maybe in such a society, Columbine would’ve been
hit by two suicide bombers, like happens in <st2:country-region w:st="on"><st2:place
w:st="on">Israel</st2:place></st2:country-region>, instead of two boys
shooting Tech-9 pistols. It's the same catch-22 with just a little extra room
for speculation.&quot; </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen paused a bit before replying, “Maybe there are no
clear answers. Maybe it’s something that’s inside of us, or our culture, or
something almost indefinable that’s the real problem. I don’t know. I used to
think I did know, but I’m just not as sure as I was about anything anymore.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>Marguerite shrugged, “But imagine</span></span><span
class=postbody> it. Neither side can point out how their solutions save lives
without pointing out, at the very same time, how their solutions take lives.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I expect,” said Helen, “that both sides will eventually
find some clever way to slip around their particular catch-22 without losing
their original message.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite suddenly narrowed her eyes. “By the way, Helen,
do you know of anyone named Ash?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen thought a moment, a little surprise by the turn in
conversation. “No, I don’t think so.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Detectives Cartwright and Warner believe that someone
named Ash may have gotten <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> her gun from the
sporting goods section of a....” Marguerite quickly looked up a piece of paper
and read, “at a store called S-Mart.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen shook her head. “I never heard of it.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I looked in the yellow pages and then <span class=SpellE>googled</span>
the name to see what I’d get. I couldn’t find anything, but that doesn’t mean
it doesn’t exist.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Just out of curiosity,” mused Helen, “could you <span
class=SpellE>google</span> S-Mart again with the words Ash and gun?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite got on-line by moving her mouse and did as
Helen requested. Several sites came up as Helen had moved to stand behind her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>After a few sites of “the evil dead” and of a man with a
metal hand, a chain saw appendage, and a gun, Helen smiled slightly. “That
would be <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite shook her head. “They list their source as an
informant.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Trust me,” said Helen, “<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
has just found a way to send her tormentors on a wild goose chase.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite shook her head. “Whenever you need a boost to
your morale, Helen, just remember the intelligence of the cops involved.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen smiled bitterly at that. Then she frowned as she
caught the time at the bottom of the screen. “Oh, dear,” said Helen, “it’s past
8:00! I better get home!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen picked up the box of new photocopies, documents, and
files and headed to the door while Marguerite walked with her telling her there
was real hope of clearing <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. Helen was confident
she could persuade the jury for leniency, but she doubted she was going to
actually save <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> from at least a little prison, or
at least a permanent record haunting her for the rest of her life. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Outside were about a half dozen reporters. Helen groaned
but kept going, and Marguerite came out with her. They pointed bright lights at
them along with the cams. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Mrs. Kramer,” said one, “how did the defendant's mother
talk you out of pressing charges?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen kept her face blank as she put the files into her
car. She wanted to blame <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> for these reporters,
but she knew that was silly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span> did not talk
me into anything,” said Marguerite. “I called Helen <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>
into my office of my own initiative to tell her I wasn’t pressing charges
against someone who saved her sister’s life from a brutal, drug-crazed
stalker.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen struggled to keep the smile of gratitude off her
face, since every muscle she twitched would be analyzed, and probably used to
slander her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite continued. “It appears that Matthew Foster
terrorized the accused and her little sister with no significant help from an
appeal to law enforcement for assistance.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen wondered why Marguerite didn’t mention how the
Lawndale PD might be responsible for what happened. Then she decided that until
they had something better than circumstantial evidence, as damning as it might
be, it would be a better idea not to waken that particular dragon yet and allow
them to prepare their defenses and counter attack. And maybe the information
could be bargained in exchanged for <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, Helen
mused. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Another reporter spoke up. “Do you champion kids taking
guns to school to take the law into their own hands?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mrs. Kramer’s voice rose and became very clear. “First, <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span> did not ‘take
the law into her own hands.’ She stopped a drug-crazed gunman from killing
anyone, particularly her own sister who was staring up into Matthew’s gun
barrel when <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> shot him from behind. She had
reason to believe Matthew would carry out such an attack after repeated threats
and previous, lesser attacks, but did not move against Matthew until she had no
other choice. 9-1-1 failed <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Quinn <span
class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>. I’m glad to say <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
herself did not fail.” She shook her head. “I will not fight to make the world
safe for homicidal stalkers.” Then she turned and went back inside, ignoring
the babbling reporters behind her, and shut the door on them. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>They quickly turned on Helen who was just opening the
driver’s door. <span class=GramE>More than one voice rose up which essentially
asked if she had a statement.</span> Helen carefully guarded her face and
realized she really should prepare some statements unless she wanted Roger <span
class=SpellE>Fillman</span> to monopolize the press to his advantage. But what
could she say right now? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen gazed into the lights and cameras, remembering that
the last time she spoke on a legal matter involving Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>,
she found herself having to leave <st2:City w:st="on">Lawndale</st2:City> for <st2:City
w:st="on"><st2:place w:st="on">Highland</st2:place></st2:City> shortly after. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She swallowed and said, “I would like to say I can’t
support <span class=SpellE>Daria’s</span> choice to carry a gun to school. But
how can I say that when she saved my Quinn, herself, and other students and teachers
at Lawndale High? We may not approve of what she did, but how can I condemn her
for what she accomplished?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Then she got in the car drove home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<br>
<span class=postbody>-------------------------------------- </span><br>
<span class=postbody>03/15/01, 8:45 P.M., Thursday </span><br>
<span class=postbody>-------------------------------------- </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen didn’t so much sit down on the couch as she
collapsed on it. She had left Jake upstairs, resting with the help of a couple
of valiums (how long since she had taken one of those? Helen wondered). </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn was still totally upset and acting almost as if she
were regressing in age. So far, it wasn’t too bad, especially when you
considered what she had just been through. But Helen sincerely hoped Quinn
would start to regain her semi-independence soon. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She had gotten a lot done today and she was exhausted. She
had been busily calling in favors, putting herself into the debt of others, and
avoiding the clowns of the media circus as best as she was able. She already
had a basic defense team for <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> prepared, which
she was personally overseeing, and she was still taking offers of the pro-gun
groups and even a feminist organization that had been leaving messages on her
machine all day. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Daria</span></span><span
class=postbody> would be in court tomorrow to arrange bond. <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>
was going to request that bail be denied completely. Helen was pretty sure she
could beat him on that, but how much would the <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>
savings be set back? She wondered if she could get some of the big gun groups
to donate to the bail bond. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She dreaded doing it, but she’d better see the 9 o’clock
news. She needed to keep up with what was being said, and what the potential
jurors are being exposed to. She gritted her teeth, remembering how some of the
media clowns were from CNN, and that meant this was nationwide news. Would it
grow, or would it sink into something anecdotal, quickly forgotten? She didn’t
know and right now she was too tired to think about that. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She clicked on the TV. <span class=GramE>Another car
commercial.</span> At least it wasn’t mostly naked women dancing around
laughing guys and giant beers. But she did wonder if she’d have to sell the car
before this was all over. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She got up and put <span class=GramE>a lasagna</span> into
the oven. It was good she had food like this she could just pop in and set the
timer on. She smiled at Quinn when she came into the kitchen behind her. Quinn
smiled back slightly and got a diet soda before heading back out. She poured
herself a glass of ice tea, too. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>When she heard the news coming on, she hurried out with
what was left of the tea. She frowned seeing Quinn sitting on the couch. But
she was in the middle of this no matter what, so perhaps she should see what
went on. Besides, she just wanted Quinn to be around her for awhile. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>When Helen sat down, Quinn leaned into her, and Helen put
an arm around her. And then she frowned. The first news item was about the
shoot-out at Lawndale High. She wondered if anyone of these jackasses would get
the story right this time. The last time, it was said there had been two
shooters--<span class=SpellE>Daria</span> <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>
and <st2:Street w:st="on"><st2:address w:st="on">Jane Lane</st2:address></st2:Street>!
She planned to sue for that, though she might drop it if they agreed to do some
positive press for her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The news started off with what she had already learned
from Marguerite. Matthew’s gun, a Model 608 .357 Magnum revolver with 8 shots,
had fired all 8 shots, wounding Michael Jordan <span class=SpellE>MacKenzie</span>
and critically injuring Ms. Angela Li, both minorities. He stopped his shooting
of minorities when he saw his ex-girlfriend and fired the rest of the bullets
at her, miraculously missing her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Then he himself was shot 3 times by <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
<span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>, the sister of the girl he was shooting
at, killing him almost instantly when the hollow points from the .32 Mark II
pierced his spine, lung, and brain. Helen snorted when they did such a
ridiculous close-up that the gun appeared much bigger than it was, followed by
a scene of <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> being lead away in handcuffs showing
her usual emotionless face, if in disarray and without her Doc Martins. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“We know by the placement of the shots,” said Detective
Cartwright, “that the accused, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> <span
class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>, has been trained in how to use a gun and hit
her target. We believe, however, she may have had more of a motive than
stopping a killer.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>Bastard.</span></span><span
class=postbody> Helen wondered how she could use this against him or for <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> was on the screen
then, looking all sanctimonious, talking about getting tough on crime,
particularly kids waving around guns with no respect for the law. He castigated
the District Attorney for refusing to prosecute “for no other reason than she
is friends with the mother of the accused.&quot; He also implied that no one in
the system knew about the problems with Matthew, and that all it would’ve taken
would be a call to 911. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen gritted her teeth. She would make sure to wave the
911 transcript regarding Matthew Foster, and how the police had then released
him with the gun he used at Lawndale High. And how would 911 save her Quinn
once he was already shooting? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen suddenly rejoiced silently that Matthew Foster was
dead, and didn’t feel a single ounce of guilt or shame over it. But that would be
something she couldn’t admit to. But she would try to make the jurors hate
Matthew as much as she did. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Others were speaking in, and the police were making their
statements which essentially said nothing other than they were looking into it
and had <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> in custody. But Helen narrowed her eyes
when one said, “we have the killer in custody.” She wondered if she could use
any of this in the trial. <span class=GramE>If only she weren’t so tired.</span>
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Then Helen’s eyes blazed in sudden interests and fury as
Matthew’s family was being interviewed. She barely had any time to look into
them yet. Maybe Matthew wasn’t their fault, but she still blamed them for what
he had done, and for what was happening to <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
right now. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>A middle-aged woman that didn’t seem to be aging well, with
scraggly blonde hair that looked <span class=GramE>fake</span>, struck a tragic
pose. The screen listed her as Mary Walker Foster, the single mother of
Matthew. Her voice finally came on with, “Where were the metal detectors? Where
was the security? I thought I was sending him to a safe school, and he gets
shot by some jilted lover and her sister!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The scene moved to a man in handcuffs. The scene listed
him as Jim Foster, Matthew’s dad. According to the newscaster, police had just
searched his home (it looked as if it happened just an hour ago), and had found
several unregistered guns, and there was a court order against him that barred
him from having guns. He was also delinquent on child support payments, guilty
of tax evasion, and had made death threats against police officers. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen knew in this case, several guns meant only two
handguns. But that would change tomorrow morning, so she let it slide. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jim Foster glared into the camera for a few seconds before
turning away, but he seemed to have sense enough not to say anything. Too bad
he didn’t have sense enough not to glare like that. The media loved it and
would play it nonstop now. Silent fury like that was almost as good as tears to
them. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Then they revealed that the gun had originally belonged to
Matthew’s maternal grandfather. An old man appeared on the screen messing with
a hearing aid. The TV listed him as John Walker. He responded “What?” a couple
of times. She wondered how many times he had said that. In some trials, people
on the stand sometimes pretended to be hard of hearing or understanding in
order to give themselves time to think. (A few even went to greater lengths,
demanding a drink of water to “quiet their cough” before answering any
question.) </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He eventually croaked out what a horrible tragedy it was,
and how bad things had gotten since he was young. “You didn’t have to worry
about if someone was going to shoot your or not when I was growing up,” he
said. He seemed to be answering questions other than the ones being directly
asked of him. He finally said he didn’t know how his gun came to be in
Matthew’s hands and he turned away. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>A picture of a cute boy about 5 came on, of him dressed up
for what looked like Easter. The caption read Matthew Foster. “My boy, my boy,”
continued Mary Walker Foster tearful voice over the picture, “he was everything
to me. Oh, God, no mother should have to lose her child....” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>Bitch!</i>, thought Helen, <i>what was <span
class=SpellE>Quinn?<span style='font-style:normal'>And</span></span></i> she
remembered hearing how Mary Foster spent most of the child support at a local
liquor store instead of taking care of Matthew. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Then it was released that Matthew had been under the
influence of methamphetamines at the time of the shooting. So far, no word that
the police knew he was a petty drug dealer. She would make them aware of it
soon enough, Helen thought with bitter rage. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen sat through some mind-numbing commercials before the
news came back on quickly recounting the highlights of what they had already
showed. Quinn tensed, and Helen focused on the TV. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Her comments earlier were already on the air. So was
Marguerite’s, but they had cut out her line about 911 failing. Still, they did
play most of what she said. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Then Helen went cold as George Bush came on the screen.
What was that <span class=SpellE>friggin</span>’ newbie doing? She’d voted for
Gore, and Gore should’ve gotten it, she fumed. Bush had been in one screw up
after another since he’d gotten sworn in last January. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Bush looked solemnly at the camera. Idiot missed his cue
card or he was struggling to read it, Helen noted as she frowned, glaring at
the screen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Another.... senseless tragedy.... has occurred in <st2:place
w:st="on"><st2:City w:st="on">Lawndale</st2:City>, <st2:State w:st="on">Virginia</st2:State></st2:place>.”
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He had pronounced occurred as “ah-<span class=SpellE>kured</span>.”
He seemed to be struggling with recalling or reading the words, not just
pronouncing them, Helen thought bitterly. This was what a <span class=SpellE>Bromwell</span>
education got you? She vaguely recalled urging <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
to think about sending out a college application to <span class=SpellE>Bromwell</span>,
but now she’d reconsider.... if <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> even had that
kind of future now. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Bush continued to struggle valiantly at forming speech.
“Another school shooting happened this morning by two gunmen.....” Bush blinked
and then said, “By two students.” Helen wondered how many takes it took for
Bush to be this <span class=GramE>coherent?</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Our prayers are with them all,” said Bush quickly, and
the scene changed again to Lawndale High as a reporter dramatically asked,
“Everyone in the nation is asking, how did it come to this? How did it come to
gun fights in our schools? But everybody is still too much in shock to answer.”
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen rolled her eyes. As if school shootings and shoot-outs
were new. But they always made bigger news when they happened at mostly
well-to-do schools like Lawndale High. Yet incidents of school shootings have
been going down for a couple of decades. There were still too many, but it was
ridiculous to act surprised by it. She should know; she looked behind the hype
enough, having learned from long, bitter experience not to take anything said
by the press at face value. The media, often called “infotainment” these days,
was actually better at shaping opinion rather than enlightening with facts. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>When the standard reports of sports, weather, and NASDAQ
came on, she switched off the TV. Quinn didn’t say anything. She smiled hoping
to break the ice with Quinn. “Quinn, what did you think of how Matthew’s family
were all dressed?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“<span class=SpellE>Ug</span>,” said Quinn blandly, not
looking up. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen blinked. Quinn was still in her shell. She sighed. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn looked up at her. “Mom?” she asked. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>“Yes, Quinn?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Why would anyone want to kill me?”</span></span><span
class=postbody> Quinn suddenly broke into sobs. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen grabbed hold of her, telling her over and over it
was okay, she was safe until Quinn calmed down some. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I’d really like to know,” cried Quinn. “No one has ever
disliked me before.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Some people are just jealous.” Helen knew there <span
class=GramE>were</span> control issues involved, too, but she was too tired to
explain that to Quinn. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“But he liked me before,” said Quinn. “He wouldn’t leave
me alone. He kept showing me his money, his good car, and he took me to Chez
Pierre. I had to tutor him a bit on how to dress and act, but he was a fast
learner. I never could figure out how he came from that family of his until I
found out about the drug deals. But he kept showing off the money and stuff. He
LIKED me. Why did he go off and want to kill me?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen didn’t really know, but Quinn needed to hear
something. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Maybe he felt like an outsider, his Jerry Springer family
a collar around his neck holding him down. Maybe he had so little money, and
been tormented by that fact, that he got into drugs. Maybe feeling no love or
acceptance at all, he tried to get that from you. Maybe he thought if he could
buy your acceptance, he could show he was better than his family or his
childhood. And then you....” Here Helen was careful. “You saw through him
finally. And he didn’t like it. He couldn’t handle the fact that he was a drug
dealing loser that was more and more like his own violent, dysfunctional family
than he wanted to be. I’m glad you got away from him, but he couldn’t stand
your leaving him behind.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Well, I told him I just dated guys for awhile. He just
wouldn’t stop.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen tried remembering what all those books she read
about how to talk to your children and get them to do what you want said. She
was finally in this situation, and she could barely recall anything! </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Quinn?” asked Helen, as she recalled a little. “Why is
his acceptance so important anyway?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Be-<span class=SpellE>cauuuse</span>,” said Quinn as if
stating the obvious, “I live by my cuteness and popularity. I survived on my
cuteness as a child and I plan to be well-taken care of because of my cuteness
and popularity when I’m older. Nobody can hurt me. Nobody can ignore me. It’s
not like I’m <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Say what?” Helen was too shocked by this to be angry,
upset, or bemused. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“<span class=SpellE>Daria</span> just doesn’t care. Or she
acts like she doesn’t. I think maybe she cares too much, so she tries to keep
people away so she doesn’t care so much. Like how she’d pretend she didn’t need
you and dad or didn’t care about your yelling about her and stuff. But I’m not
like that! I got you to calm down and take care of me by being cute! By showing
you all my friends and activities I became a part of. By showing you I can be
cute and popular and busy and everything.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Quinn,” said Helen getting annoyed despite her intentions
to remain calm. “You didn’t have to be cute to be cared for. We took care of
you--will take care of you--because you’re our daughter and we love you....” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Until someone who you barely <span class=GramE>knows</span>
calls for you, and then we’re forgotten....” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Quinn! That’s not----” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Cursed fate caused her phone to ring right then--the one
with the unlisted number the reporters hadn’t been able to get yet. She fought
to finish what she was saying instead of answering the phone. Damn it all, this
could be important. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Hello,” said Helen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>,” said a
male voice that she didn’t identify right away. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yes?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“This is Andrew Landon.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Hi!” said Helen. She noticed then that Quinn was giving
her the most adorable if sad face. She wiped a couple of Quinn’s lingering
tears away. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I want you to know, Mrs. <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>Morgendorffer</span></span><span class=GramE>, that</span> we’re
behind you all the way. Jodie saw Matthew Foster try to kill Quinn. And Miss Li
and Michael Mackenzie.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“How awful!” said Helen, as she ran her hand over Quinn’s
hair careful not to mess it up in a way that would upset her. Quinn gave her
such a sad smile back. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I immediately got on the phone with the District Attorney
when I found out how Jodie herself had nearly been shot and told her not to do
anything to <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. Jodie would not stop talking about
how <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> saved them all. And she told me to tell you
to call her on the witness stand, and she’ll tell everyone in court the same
thing.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Thank you, Mr. Landon,” said Helen sincerely. “It’s nice
to know I still have friends in this town.” Helen pulled Quinn a little closer
to her and smiled down at her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I just saw you and Marguerite on the news,” he said, “you
both presented well, and made better statements than I thought would be
possible in your case.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Oh, there are going to be some big surprises coming up,
Mr. Landon,” she said. “In fact, the only thing that really worries me are the
federal charges.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I assume you can’t share the details with me?” asked
Landon. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I’m afraid not,” said Helen, “but trust me, we’re
confident about defending <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>!” <i>Except maybe for
having the gun</i>, Helen thought morosely. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“That’s wonderful,” said Landon. “I’ve tried calling you
all day, but all I got was your machine.” He sounded a bit worried, “So I
finally got this number from Marguerite. I hope you don’t mind.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Oh, no, I don’t mind! It’s just the reporters all day,”
said Helen exasperatedly. “Luckily, this number is unlisted, given only to
people I have business with. You’re welcome to use it anytime.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Be careful the reporters don’t get your business <span
class=GramE>card</span>.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Thank you for pointing that out, Mr. Landon!” She sounded
very sincere. In truth, she had already hidden them. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“No problem,” said Mr. Landon. “I’ve had my own battles
with the press, too. It will get better. <span class=GramE>After it gets
worse.”</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen laughed politely. “I hope it gets better soon.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I know you’re very busy, Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>,
so I’ll let you go.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I am very busy, but I’m also very glad you called to
offer me and <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> your support. You don’t know how
much that means to <st2:State w:st="on"><st2:place w:st="on"><span class=GramE>me</span>.</st2:place></st2:State>”
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Anytime,” said Landon. “And if you need any help, you
just let me know.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I will,” said Helen. “Bye!” She hung up and looked down
at Quinn as they smiled sadly at one another. “What were we talking about?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Nothing, Mom. Just hold me.” Quinn leaned into her. It
reminded Helen of when Quinn was younger before she got wrapped up in that
Fashion Club of hers. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen frowned in concern at that. She knew they were
discussing something important. “Quinn,” Helen started, “I’m not going to
ground you for all that you did as everything that’s happening now must be
punishment enough. But I hope you don’t do anymore drugs. <span class=GramE>Especially
to keep thin.”</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn looked at her. <span class=GramE>“What about all
those pills you and Dad take to calm yourself down and pick yourself back up?</span>
<span class=GramE>In addition to the coffee and sometimes alcohol?”</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen blinked, then fought anger, and then suppressed her
natural reactions. “It’s a bad habit, and we’re both going to stop,” said
Helen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn looked as if she didn’t quite believe that. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Really,” said Helen. “Right after this case gets cleared
up.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Okay,” said Quinn, turning back to the TV, seeming to
watch it even though it was off. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen sat there comforting Quinn for a couple of minutes
or so, wondering how much time the lasagna had, when there was a knock at the
door. She frowned. “That had better NOT be the press,” she muttered darkly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She gently disengaged herself from Quinn and went to the
door. Taking a breath, she opened it to find Mr. <span class=SpellE>DeMartino</span>.
“Hi!” said a tired Helen, “What can I do for you?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>,” replied <span
class=SpellE>DeMartino</span> in a low growl, “I was wondering if I could come
in. There <span class=GramE>are couple</span> of strange cars out with people
in them and I fear they may be reporters, and I’m allergic to such.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen frowned and motioned him in, wondering if those cars
held reporters or cops. “Please excuse the mess, Mr. <span class=SpellE>DeMartino</span>,
we haven’t had time to clean up after the police tore up our home.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I’ll excuse YOU, Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>,
but I’ll hold it against the police.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen laughed lightly. “Would you like something to drink,
Mr. <span class=SpellE>DeMartino</span>?” she asked, retreating into her home. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mr. <span class=SpellE>DeMartino</span> followed. “Just
water, thank you,” grumbled Anthony <span class=SpellE>DeMartino</span>, “and
call me Anthony.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Anthony,” repeated Helen, “You can call me Helen.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Hello, Quinn,” said Anthony when he saw her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Hi,” said Quinn weakly. She turned towards the kitchen.
“Mom, I’m going to go do my homework.” She got up and left, heading for the
stairs. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“School opens tomorrow,” growled Anthony, “but it looks as
if it’s going to be a counseling session. If you don’t want to listen to Ms.
Manson and Timothy O’ Neill drone on for hours on end, you might want to stay
home.” He raised his voice a little as Quinn was still going up the stairs, if
smiling at him politely. “I know I plan to take it off!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Say what?” asked Helen, as she came out with a glass of
water. Handing him the water, she looked around. “Where did Quinn go?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“She said she had homework to do.” He restrained from a
tirade of Quinn’s working habits. Besides, Quinn had been doing noticeably
better this year. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Oh,” said Helen. “Forgive her, <span class=SpellE>Mr</span>....
Anthony. I don’t need to explain why she’s not in the mood to see anyone.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Especially anyone from the school,” muttered Anthony. “I
hope.... she does not have a problem.... ever returning to Lawndale High again.
I wouldn’t blame her if she never steps a foot inside the school again, but I
would miss her.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen blinked. “Thank you, Anthony.” She sat down. “Make
yourself comfortable.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Anthony sat down on a chair, but he hardly looked relaxed.
“Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Morgen</span>....” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Helen, please,” insisted Helen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Helen,” said Anthony. “I want to first tell you how sorry
I am about everything that happened. We should’ve gotten rid of the Foster boy
some time ago.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yes,” said Helen in a low, tired voice. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I also want to volunteer to act as a character witness
for <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> on the stand.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen smiled then, if tiredly. “Thank you.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And I wanted to warn you.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen’s gaze focused on Anthony. <span class=GramE>“About
what?”</span> She realized everything she was learning was starting to make her
a bit paranoid. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“As you are probably aware,” said Anthony, “I’m a member
of the NRA. I’ve become somewhat disillusioned with them for many reasons. The
reason that matters to you, Helen, is they are known to back secret treaties
with groups like Handgun Control Inc. and other such groups in exchange for
favors and capitulations on their side in exchange for the same on the other
side.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yes,” said Helen. “Negotiations can be nasty sometimes.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Exactly, Helen. <span class=GramE>Exactly.</span> The NRA
leadership is also more concerned with its image and membership drives than
actually solving anything. Hell, if they SOLVED anything,” here his eye bulged
a bit but he quickly calmed back down, “then they would lose a lot of the
support of those who cling to them in fear and desperation. Then they wouldn’t
be worth as much to the politicians. They would lose money. They would lose
more value to the political campaigns. They probably would not become
meaningless, but many of the perks they now enjoy would diminish. And human
beings, being the LAZY! <span class=SpellE>Er</span>, that is, human beings
being what they are sometimes do what is best for themselves personally, and
not for those they have an obligation to.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I’ve heard they plan to use <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
to challenge the federal statutes of the Gun Safe Zone Act and Project Safe
Neighborhoods,” said Helen. “Since these are laws that my daughter has very
obviously violated, with serious consequences involved, I am inclined to let
the NRA offer any help that they can.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Anthony nodded his head in understanding. “I would
question your wisdom if you didn’t at least consider their help,” he grumbled.
“But you should know that this case has engaged the interests of those at the
very top of the chain of command. And should it become personally profitable to
make a MARTYR out of <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, I fear they won’t
hesitate to make a deal under the table with Handgun Control Inc. to crush
her.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen made a noise for him to continue. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“You hope, as I do,” said Anthony, “that they will remove
these laws, thus clearing a severe obstacle that <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
is unlikely to overcome otherwise. But should they get close to achieving their
goal, <span class=GramE>then</span> the groups opposed to them will want to
deal. And if such a stunning victory meant a short celebration followed by a
loss of ACTIVE membership as the tide seemed to be turning and the <span
class=GramE>more lazy</span> could stop worrying about our second amendment
rights, the NRA leaders might be tempted to keep the threat hanging over our
heads a little longer. Or if they can get promises from Handgun Control Inc. to
let the NRA have their way on several pet projects, they might offer <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> in return.&quot; </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen was getting used to this. &quot;Anything else?&quot;
she asked sardonically. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Anthony smiled cynically. &quot;The NRA is starting to
collect contributions for a defense fund for <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
now, and it might also show a discrepancy between what is given to help secure
her release, and how much of it makes it to <span class=SpellE>Daria’s</span>
defense, too. Perhaps you should dedicate some people to collect money for <span
class=SpellE>Daria’s</span> defense personally.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I thank you for such blunt honesty,” said Helen. “And I
should tell you that I have been a member of Handgun Control Inc. for some
time, though all I ever did was participate in poster card campaigns, a few
minor donations, and minimal politicking for them.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“That sounds like me with the NRA,” mentioned Anthony.
“Now, anyway.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Well, I can tell you that should the NRA win such a
stunning victory, HCI would ring every alarm they possibly could and could no
doubt terrify HCI membership into an all-time high. With such voting leverage
and money at their fingertips, the politicians will line up to tap the awesome
resource they become.....” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And the NRA,” grinned Anthony, “will be required to stand
up to them, to keep them from taking away our right to bear arms. Something you
will be sure they know.” He laughed when he saw her smile. “Mrs. <span
class=SpellE>Morg</span>... I mean Helen, I like the way you strategize. I
think that if anyone can get <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> out of the
predicament that she’s now in, it’s you.” It was uncanny how for just a moment
when Helen smiled she looked a lot like <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“One more thing, Helen,” said Anthony, after taking a
drink of water. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yes?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I happen to know two of the people they’re sending here.
They like showing off for the press. If not handled discreetly, it could
backfire.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“More clowns,” groaned Helen. The circus was just getting
more and more rings. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yes. If you need any help dealing with them, don’t
hesitate to call <st2:State w:st="on"><st2:place w:st="on"><span class=GramE>me</span>.</st2:place></st2:State>”
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Thank you,” said Helen again. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And the two I’m thinking of will claim to have ties to
the GOP. They do, but they have less Republican support than you might realize.
Don’t expect any favors from any of the politicians just because they’re
Republican.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen nodded. Then she told him how the current mayor was
working with the NRA, while the city attorney was gaining the support of groups
like HCI by crucifying <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, and anyone involved in
seeing either student armed, in hopes of gaining the support and backing he
needed to become the next mayor of <st2:City w:st="on"><st2:place w:st="on">Lawndale</st2:place></st2:City>.
But she didn’t tell him any more than that. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Anthony swore, and his eye bulged. “It was bad enough when
it was <span class=SpellE>Tweedle</span> Dee GORE vs. <span class=SpellE>Tweedle</span>
<span class=SpellE>Dum</span> Bush, but NOW I can look forward to <span
class=SpellE>Sleezy</span> Dee GRANT vs. SLEEZY <span class=SpellE>Dum</span> <span
class=SpellE>Fillman</span> in the next mayoral campaign of <st2:City w:st="on"><st2:place
w:st="on">Lawndale</st2:place></st2:City>!” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen snorted. “<span class=SpellE>Tweedle</span> <span
class=SpellE>Dum</span> Bush? Don’t tell me you don’t like that <span
class=SpellE>Bromwell</span> graduate.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“He never would’ve graduated any class of MINE,” said
Anthony, his eye bulging with the last word. Then he sighed. “Bush, I’m afraid,
will be the man liberals love to hate, and conservatives hate to love.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen laughed lightly at that, genuinely amused. “Listen
to us Anthony! We were once on opposite ends of the political spectrum, and
here we are talking about our own sides in terms of <span class=GramE>Them</span>.”
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Anthony smiled back in a way that said he was enjoying the
irony, too. “<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,” he said, “<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,
and the danger our kids are in today, from BOTH sides of the law, are far more
important than the petty partisan politics.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Agreed,” said Helen. “Our kids come before politics.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Anthony grunted agreement before adding, “I’ll send you <span
class=SpellE>Nicki</span> <span class=SpellE>Fellenzer’s</span> e-mail <span
class=SpellE>addy</span>. If either side, the NRA or HCI, try anything
underhanded or otherwise act in a way that is contrary to <span class=SpellE>Daria’s</span>
best interests, you let her know. She’s one of the few people out there who
will fight to make sure the NRA stays honest--or that the NRA’s membership know
about it. You can bet she’ll be paying close attention to this case.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen could not believe how helpful Anthony was being. She
smiled genuine gratitude at him and felt the stirring of real hope for <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> to be cleared of ALL charges. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen took a sip and asked, “Do you know anything about
the Virginia Citizens Defense League, Anthony?” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Yes,” said Anthony, “I’m a member of them, as well. If
they’re helping, then I’m glad I send them money and share my time.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“They are. It might be nice if you’d be willing to help me
with them should they provide a problem or do something that confuses <st2:State
w:st="on"><st2:place w:st="on"><span class=GramE>me</span>.</st2:place></st2:State>”
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“I will, Helen. <span class=GramE>Anything to help <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Quinn.”</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen smiled her thanks and yawned. “I’m sorry,” she said,
“it’s just been so busy today.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Anthony stood up. “I completely understand,” he said, “and
I should be going anyway, Helen, thank you for the hospitality.” He approached
Helen a little as Helen got up. In a lower voice he told her, “I was also going
to tell you to pass on to <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> for me that she
should not be ashamed of what she did. Killing a man is nothing to be proud of,
but in this case it’s nothing to be ashamed of, either.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Thank you, Anthony,” replied Helen, “for all your help
and kind words.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Anthony cleared his throat. “But seeing Quinn <span
class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span> when I came in, and knowing that had <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> done nothing to stop it, there would be NO Quinn <span
class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span> EVER again, I have to say she SHOULD be
proud. Or, at the very least, anyone who allowed Matthew Foster to do what he
intended to do should be ashamed if they looked the other way because they knew
their own life would be easier that way.” </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen couldn’t think of anything to say to that, so she
smiled and nodded to him, leading him to the door. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“And for the immediate future, I am acting principal of
Lawndale High. Should Quinn return, I’ll see to it that Quinn is not harassed
in any <span class=GramE>way.</span> <span class=GramE>ESPECIALLY by
REPORTERS!”</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen smile grew. “Congratulations,” she said. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>“Oh, my role as principal is only temporary. No more than
to the end of the school year. Hopefully, by then you will have this mess
straightened out. <span class=GramE>For Quinn, anyway.</span> Good luck to you,
Helen, and remember I will help you, Quinn, and <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
in any way I can.” He nodded to her and walked out to his car. He didn’t look
back as Helen closed the door. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Part of her was actually sorry to see him go. Anthony’s
words kept running through her mind as she went to check on the lasagna. She
had 4 minutes left on the timer, so she went ahead and took it out, ripped the
cover all the way off, and put it back in for another 20. Then she decided to
steam some veggies. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Her mind wandered over the political and legal
implications as she cut some broccoli up. One weakness was that she could
really use <span class=SpellE>Sleezeball</span> Dee Grant’s support. And he
would go with whatever side got him the most public support. And the support
was created in large part by the media. And the media tended to shape public
opinion. She could imagine how that was going to go. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>On the other hand, Helen mused, knowing that <span
class=SpellE>Fillman</span> was going to try to replace him next election might
make him an ally, too. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She needed options and leverage, but she wasn’t sure how
to get it. If she didn’t get it, then she was backed in a corner, and so was <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>. Helen got the broccoli steaming as she brainstormed.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen knew if the NRA was willing to make deals with the
other side in exchange for political favors, then the groups they dealt with
would do the same. It takes two to tango. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>And since she was a minor member of HCI, she stood a
chance of having HCI and the other gun control groups listen to the offer she
was thinking of. If she pulled this off right, then not only would the NRA
likely keep bashing away at the laws they hated, but their major opponents
would turn into allies, helping <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> immensely and
taking away Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman’s</span> support, which this was a
large part of what this was about anyway! </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen grinned energetically as the strategy she had in
