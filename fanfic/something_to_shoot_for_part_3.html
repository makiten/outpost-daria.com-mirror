<span class=postbody>03/23/01 FRIDAY 8:30 P.M. </span><br>
<span class=postbody>-------------------------------------- </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Detective Warner was outside the station smoking a
cigarette, talking to a man whom Helen assumed to be another detective, as she
drove up. He dropped his cigarette to the asphalt, blowing smoke out one last
time, and stomped it out. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen had a wild urge to run him down. Instead she
stoically parked, took a deep breath, and looked around. She'd hoped Marguerite
would be here already--she was so grateful she'd managed to reach the DA at home--but
apparently she hadn't arrived yet. Much as she'd hoped Marguerite could walk
into the station with her, Helen had been too tense to wait longer at home, she
had to come. She'd have to do this on her own; she just hoped her friend showed
up in time. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She got out, prepared to be all businesslike about this.
The other DT went back inside the building before Mrs. Morgendorffer had
stepped out of her car. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Thank you for coming down so promptly," said Detective
Warner, almost sounding sincere. There was a bit of a hard smile at the left
corner of his mouth that offset the apparent sincerity in his voice. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>It took all her will not to yell at him. What they did to
Daria was an outrage, but now that she knew just how responsible they were for
this mess getting started in the first place, she wished them all a horrible
death. She smiled a cold smile to match Detective Warner's mocking one and
said, "Let me get my daughter, Detective." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I'm not sure that's a possibility," said Warner, sounding
regretful. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Anything is a possibility," said Helen brusquely, "including
criminal charges against Lawndale's finest with a colossal lawsuit by several
families that you wouldn't believe." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Well, let's see what happens," said Warner shrugging,
heading into the station. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen Morgendorffer was led through an entrance and into a
nondescript hall with multiple doors off it. There were very few cops here at
all. She wondered how many were out at the site of the shooting and drug bust. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Do you have the boy she made the mistake of dating in
custody?" asked Helen tightly, "Or did you let him go to find bigger drug
dealers for you?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Detective Warner almost spun on her then, a cold glare set
on his face, but he controlled himself and acted as if he hadn't heard her. He
stopped by a door and stuck a key into it. "We have him," he finally said in a
noncommittal tone of voice. The door opened and he motioned Helen in. Helen
went in to see a table with two chairs on one side and one chair on the other. A
mirror covered the wall behind the two chairs. Detective Warner came past her
and looked at himself in the mirror before turning around and facing Helen. He
did not sit down. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>This is the room</i>, Helen thought, <i>where they
handcuffed Daria to a chair and... <span class=GramE>and</span>...</i> Helen
put it out of her mind as she heard the footsteps of two people outside the
open door. She gasped as a female police officer escorted Quinn into the room. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn was a tussled mess. She looked at the floor, crying
softly as she was brought in. Helen went over to her, and Quinn looked up at
her. Helen stopped amazed, her mouth hanging open as she saw her daughter's
face. A huge bruise was already swelling under her left eye, another bruise was
forming almost beside her right eye, and the right side of her jaw was swollen
and discolored. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Has she seen a doctor!?" exclaimed Helen. She didn't
trust herself to say anything else. She looked down prepared to demand the
handcuffs be taken off but saw she was unrestrained. The index finger on her right
hand was in a bandage. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I should think so," said Warner coldly. "Have my orders
been carried out, Sergeant <span class=SpellE>Lanny</span>?" The "sergeant" was
said with a slight mocking emphasis. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yes," said Sergeant <span class=SpellE>Lanny</span>. "Her
face is marked up. <span class=GramE>Too bad.</span> It was quite pretty."
Quinn started crying harder then. "She's got another beauty mark on her left
ribs. Doc doesn't think any ribs are cracked, but you should get her to see a REAL
doctor, ASAP." She looked Quinn over. "She has a little blood in her hair, but
it's not hers. It belongs to the guy who attacked her. Her mouth was busted
enough to bleed, but only a little. I doubt she'll need any dental work done."
She said this without a trace of feeling in her voice, except her contempt of
the doctor, and her despite of Warner. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn's escort seemed oddly dispirited for being a
sergeant, and Helen couldn't figure out why she was doing grunt work. Not that
she cared. She wanted to claw her eyes out, right along with Detective Warner's,
for laying a hand on Quinn. As far as she was concerned, since these cops had
let Matthew go and thus started the chain of events that led to tonight, they
had assisted that boy in beating Quinn--and then had the gall to arrest her! </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Thank you, Sergeant <span class=SpellE>Lanny</span>,"
said Warner gruffly, "that will be all." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Lanny</span></span><span
class=postbody> turned and left without a word, closing the door behind her.
Helen went up and drew Quinn into her arms, <span class=GramE>who</span>
started crying harder. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Oh, rest assured," said Detective Warner coldly, "Scott
Rhodes looks a lot worse than she does. Unlike Quinn, he DOES require medical
attention. They think she may have broken his finger, in addition to the nasty
beating she dealt him. Shot at him, too, by <span class=GramE>her own</span> <span
class=SpellE>admiss</span>--" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"An admission inadmissible in court!" Helen cried, almost
in a shriek. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Warner shrugged. "Hardly matters. She failed to kill Scott
as she intended, leaving a valuable witness, and forensics think there's enough
evidence to show she did, in fact, try to murder Scott." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"If anything, it was justifiable as self-defense," said
Helen. "I know my daughter, and she's incapable of attacking anyone!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Warner rolled his eyes. "Have a seat," he said, "and we'll
get started." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"My daughter is not saying anything to you. I want to
speak to her alone. And I'll have you know, Reid technique or not--" She didn't
trust herself to say anything beyond that for fear of being arrested for
terroristic threats. She was sure he'd love it if he could get her in jail and
have Jake monitor the interrogation. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Warner frowned. "We're still gathering evidence at this
stage, Mrs. Morgendorffer, but it's clear your daughters are involved in some
very serious crimes. I'm not sure I can let her go. If we talk about it now--" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No," said Helen coldly, "you've done quite enough as it
is. The truth will come out in court, and I will test the validity of your 'evidence,'
or lack thereof, in a court of law!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I'm sure you'll try. <span class=GramE>That's why--" He
frowned at a knock at the door.</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen moved away from the door and Detective Warner,
pulling Quinn with her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"What is it!?" yelled Warner, approaching the door. He
stopped when he saw the door was being unlocked. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The door came open and Marguerite entered, escorted by
another detective. Helen smiled gratefully. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Detective Warner's brows rose, and he threw a suspicious
glare Helen's way. "It's not often that the District Attorney sits in on an
interrogation," said Warner coldly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I've already looked at the evidence," said Marguerite
just as coldly, "and decided that until more conclusive evidence comes in, I'm
not pressing charges. Since Mrs. Morgendorffer won't let the victim say
anything anyway, I came down here to tell you that you can save yourself the
trouble." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The evidence," replied Warner in a voice of restrained
rage, "is still being collected and processed as we speak. There is no way you
could even know what it is!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Au contraire," said Marguerite, in a rare show of what
she liked to call her 'French' upbringing in Louisiana. "There are plenty of
officers concerned with the way some matters are being investigated, and they
complain to anyone who will listen." She met his cold glare with her own. "You
have ample evidence that the boy hid drugs in his home. Drugs you had to
uncover. By the way, what made you think to bring drug dogs to a domestic
dispute?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Detective Warner's breathing increased. "Earlier
intelligence told us the boy was probably a dealer, and he maintained a cordial
relation with Matthew Foster before his untimely demise at the hands of the SUSPECT'S
sister. Drugs were found in a hollowed-out compartment between the mattresses
of Scott's bed. Dogs seemed prudent, as they turned out to be." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Spare me," said Marguerite, "your department is known for
its lackadaisical attitude. You went in looking for drugs specifically.
Otherwise, you'd simply throw the two feuding love birds in jail and let them
post bail or call their parents." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Weapons were found on the scene, including a gun used by
the suspect," added Warner. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"A weapon, I'm sure, that belonged to the boy you brought
in." Marguerite looked at Quinn's face. "I've seen pistol whippings before,
Detective, and I recognize that mark by the VICTIM'S left eye." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Be that as it may," replied Detective Warner a bit more
calmly, "she still took the gun away from him and tried to shoot him while he
was unarmed. If she were so innocent, why didn't she just hold him and call the
police, instead of emptying the <span class=SpellE>mag</span> through three
bedrooms, including five into the master bedroom down the hall, which was in
the other side of the house from the room in which the alleged beating took
place?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Maybe because she had already been fired upon barely over
a week ago, despite the quality law enforcement in this town, and she was not
thinking clearly due to past trauma," said Marguerite scornfully. "Or maybe she
was scared and in a life-threatening situation, Detective. Especially as I'm
told she was being fired upon by a <span class=SpellE>Benelli</span> M3 super
90, semi-auto pump shotgun, from the same master bedroom!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Detective Warner coughed as he saw Helen's furious gaze
settle on him with a new intensity. "The other gun jammed after firing once."
He shrugged. "I'm waiting on forensics to tell me more." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So did you catch Quinn with a gun in her hand? Since she's
alive, I'm assuming the answer is no. Given the reputation of Lawndale's finest,
it was probably a good thing she didn't pull a cell phone out." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Detective Warner shook his head coldly. He hated the bad
case of "contempt of cop" this black bitch demonstrated. Not much he could do
about it at the moment, either. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No," said Marguerite, as if she <span class=GramE>were</span>
cross examining a defendant on the stand. "You found her, beaten to a pulp,
barely holding her assailant <span class=GramE>down,</span> in a neighborhood
she didn't know, wondering how she was going to get away." She cleared her
throat. "Unarmed." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"As was the boy," replied the detective. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>"A boy in good physical health that
weighs nearly twice as much as Quinn and is a whole head taller than she is."</span></span><span
class=postbody> She shook her head and added sarcastically, "I'm sure Quinn had
nothing to worry about." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Quinn has already been found in the company of one drug
dealer," replied Detective Warner. "I find it very odd that she was in the
company of another, so soon after the prior shooting, too." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So you think Quinn is a dealer, too?" Marguerite asked in
surprise. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Or a user," the detective replied. "I'm waiting on the
results from the urine sample." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So what did the strips say?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Warner coughed. "The strips are temporarily not to be
found. We'll either get them when we can spare a man to look, or do it the old
fashion way." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite rolled her eyes, wondering if this was
incompetence or something worse. She thought about telling him she wanted his
urine analyzed after the strips were found, but decided against it. Instead,
she said, "I assume you had her take a breathalyzer, too." When the detective
merely nodded, she added, "Well?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Trace amounts of alcohol in her system. Itself a crime,"
he added. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"But one you can release her into her mother's custody
for," Marguerite responded, "since your test found no other drugs?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Even now, we're gathering evidence," added Detective
Warner meaningfully. "I know we have Quinn's fingerprints on a <span
class=SpellE>Glock</span> 32. I also expect we'll have another warrant soon.
Maybe a warrant for you, too, Mrs. Kramer, seeing how you're tied into all of
this somehow." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So you have nothing but purely circumstantial evidence to
make even a probable cause for the charges you're levying against the victim."
It was a statement more than a question. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Since <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> is prosecuting
this case, I think I'll leave that to his discretion," he replied disdainfully.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I thought <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> was
prosecuting the shooting at Lawndale High?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"In which the suspect's sister was the shooter. I'm sure <span
class=SpellE>Fillman</span> is just covering the bases," said Detective Warner,
who was growing very uncomfortable. He'd never been interrogated in the
interrogation room before, and found he didn't care for it. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Oh, <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> is about to have
much bigger problems. Unless you want to join him, I suggest you cover your
ass, which includes releasing Quinn into her mother's custody right now." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>A silence settled on the room. Marguerite and Warner
glared at each other, while Helen glared at Warner herself as she held a crying
Quinn, and the other detective stood by quietly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The other detective cleared his throat. "I think we should
let her go," he said. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Detective Warner blinked in shocked surprise, while the
others showed no reaction. "Excuse me, Cartwright," he said, "but why by all
that's reasonable would I want to do that? We should get the information now!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Detective Cartwright shrugged. "We can press charges later
when we have all the evidence in, and can measure it against the statement
Quinn Morgendorffer has already given us." He raised a brow. "I assume she's
already given a urine sample?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Detective Warner nodded. "Yes, and she's scheduled to take
a lie detector test Monday morning, too." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"There you go," said Detective Cartwright. "We can still
arrest her and press charges after the evidence has been investigated, and the
results of the lie detector are in. And if our suspicions prove to be grounded
in fact, our case against her will be the stronger for <span class=GramE>it</span>."
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"And if the suspect runs?" asked Detective Warner,
deciding that this was the best course of action after all. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"If she runs, we know who to go after," replied Detective
Cartwright nonchalantly. "She's not going anywhere. I'm more interested in
dealing with the other suspect in custody before he can concoct too much of a
cover story. We already know he's clever." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Detective Warner narrowed his eyes as he thought a bit.
Finally, he pulled a piece of paper out of his shirt pocket and wrote on it
before handing it to a furious Helen. "Monday, 10 A.M., Quinn Morgendorffer
will have to take a lie detector test. Be there, or I'll send someone to get
you. <span class=GramE>If I haven't already."</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen fought back the urge to leap at him and beat him
until he lay dead. She took the paper with a free hand without a word. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Okay," said Detective Warner, "cut her loose." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"This way, Mrs. Morgendorffer," said Detective Cartwright.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"But this isn't over," added Detective Warner, just as all
three women were starting to leave. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"On that much," said Marguerite, "you are absolutely
right." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Once outside, Helen gratefully began to thank Marguerite
for coming down, but Marguerite stopped her and led them to her SUV and
motioned them to get in. Once inside, Marguerite said, "Quinn, I don't want you
to say anything. I'm going to just say a few things to your mother and you talk
to her later. <span class=GramE>Alone.</span> Got it?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Oh... okay," she said. Her voice still held tears in it,
and she was obviously exhausted. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Helen," said Marguerite, "this doesn't look good at all.
I bought you some time, but I'm afraid that's about all I can do for you." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Thank you for all that you've already done," said Helen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Marguerite let out a pent up breath. "I've got a <span
class=SpellE>P.I</span>. investigating the events. Believe me, after years of
working with the local law enforcement, I've found him useful more than once.
Especially as he's not as bound by red tape like the more proper law
enforcement." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Has he found anything out?" asked Helen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yes," said Marguerite. "Problem is<span class=GramE>,</span>
he's not sure what's going on. Something big, though, and it looks like your
daughters are involved somehow. But," she added quickly, "he does NOT believe
that your daughters, or anyone they know, are drug dealers or users of any
kind. But the local alpha of the methamphetamine market is nervous about
something." She added emphatically, "For now on, keep your daughters at home!
At all times!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"But Quinn has to go to school!" protested Helen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Have someone drive her to and from school," replied
Marguerite, "someone other than Daria, because that wouldn't look good at all."
<i>Not to mention what the press and <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> would
make of Daria being on school grounds.</i> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"What's going on in the police station, Marguerite?" asked
Helen. "I detected a lot of hostility between officers. What are the office
politics there?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Sorry, Helen, I can't share that, yet," was all she would
say. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen was hurt, but accepted it. Marguerite had done far
more for her than she had any right to expect. "Thank you for the help you have
given me," she said sincerely. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I'm still helping, Helen," she responded. "I just can't
say how I'm helping just yet." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>After that, they said their good-byes, and Helen started
to drive Quinn home. In a dispirited voice, Quinn honestly told her everything,
even about Buffy (which Helen decided to ignore for now), on the way home.
Helen had to park in the driveway and let Quinn finish talking for fear she
would stop once she was around other people. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Did you know this boy was friends with Matthew?" she
asked. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I knew they talked," said Quinn. "I had no idea they were
close friends or even partners in anything." That was partially true, though
Helen caught something in Quinn's voice that made her suspicious. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen cleared her throat and said, "I hope you can say all
this for the lie detector." When Quinn said nothing, she sighed. "Well, it's
getting cold out here. We'll talk about that test later. Right now, I want you
to go upstairs to bed and get some rest. I'm going to try to get you a doctor's
appointment as soon as I can. <span class=GramE>Tomorrow, if possible.</span>
Are you hungry?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No," said Quinn. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Then I want you to go up and get some sleep, okay?" Helen
hugged Quinn before getting out. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn quietly got out and followed her mom inside. She
looked at the floor with a feeling of guilt when she saw Daria's eyes open in
shock at the sight of her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"What happened to you?" asked Daria shocked. She knew
Quinn had been arrested, but she had no idea she had been beaten up. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Bad date," she said in a low voice. "Do you mind if I
just go up and go to bed?" she asked. When Daria shook her head, a concerned
expression on her face, Quinn went up to go to bed. She did nothing more than
pull her clothes off and get into bed, not even bothering to clean <span
class=GramE>herself</span> up. She was asleep less than a minute later. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>But back downstairs, the day continued for Helen and
Daria. "Where's your dad?" asked Helen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Still upstairs, sleeping off the valiums," said Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen frowned. Jake was getting addicted to those uppers
and downers. It might be wise to let those get out of his system for awhile. "Okay,"
she said. It was still good not to have him freaking out right now. She could
deal with him tomorrow. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"What the hell happened to Quinn?" asked Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen sighed, and then summed up the high points. "Do you
know this boy at all, Daria?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria shook her head. "I knew of him, like Matthew. <span
class=GramE>Which is to say I knew he existed in Quinn's grade, and that's it.</span>"
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Not long after, Helen and Daria were eating lasagna on
their own, sitting on the couch as they ate, watching the sordid incident being
played out on the news. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The sister of the shooter," said a female reporter, "Daria
Morgendorffer who shot a boy last Wednesday, has also been arrested for
shooting at a friend of Matthew Foster tonight. A boy she had also been dating,
just as she had dated Matthew Foster." The scene switched to police as the
reporters asked, "Were any Nazi flags or other hate paraphernalia found at the
scene of the shooting?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"At this time, we have not completely gone through all of
the evidence," said Detective Warner. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The scene changed to show a house surrounded by police
tape and police cars. A gleeful account of drugs were given, along with footage
showing bullet holes in several walls, including a big round one at the end of
a hallway. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The question we must all ask ourselves," said the
reporter grimly, "is why have our children become so obsessed with sex, drugs,
guns, and hate?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I hope they don't show less restraint than they already
have," mentioned Daria, as the scene changed to that to show Mayor Grant. "Or
the problems THEY'RE obsessed with might turn them into the same kind of
talking head as Jerry Springer." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yes, we've had another shooting," stated Mayor Grant on
TV. "This time, either a domestic dispute or a drug related one. Police are
sill looking into the matter. This is what we have police for. I say let them do
their job. I'll have answers when they give them to <span class=GramE>me</span>."
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Is the shooter's sister, Daria Morgendorffer, a vigilante
likely to come after the boy who attacked her younger sister?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Daria Morgendorffer is a disgruntled vigilante, but I
doubt she'll have a chance to take another life. As your new mayor, I am seeing
to it that law and order are coming back to Lawndale, and with more funding to
hire new police and upgrade their equipment, these young hoodlums will be taken
off our streets once and for all!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Are stalking cases still going to be a problem?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Stalking? Oh, yes, those were a problem. <span
class=GramE>But not for long.</span> Not while I'm mayor." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria rolled her eyes. "Tell me, isn't violence, not to
mention other things like the economy, worse since he became mayor?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen didn't stop watching the TV. "Yes, Daria, but as
long as he can prosecute you, it looks like he's doing something, and people
feel better." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria replied, "Who says human sacrifice to appease the
gods for better fortune and prosperity ever went out of fashion?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Shhh!" said Helen, still listening. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Are the accessibility of guns a problem, Mayor?" asked
one reporter. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mayor Grant seemed to laugh a bit. "Of course not, and
with the Eddie Eagle program run by the NRA, and Project Safe Home, guns will
become even less of a problem. The real problem we have is the media and its
sick, sensationalist trend to glorify the very things our kids are doing. The
AMA has proven the Brady Bill useless, but the Free Congress Foundation has
done a study showing our music and movies are teaching our kids to act
violently, promiscuously, and to misuse guns." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Huh?" asked Daria. "Did that make sense?" When no answer
came, she added, "I wonder if Mrs. Brand's group, Handgun Control or <span
class=GramE>whatever,</span> will try to buy off the AMA now." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>Speak of the devil</i> thought Daria bemused, as Mrs.
Brand came on the screen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"What Mayor Grant would have you ignore is that this
recent crime wave of youthful violence that is happening under his shift is
exacerbated by the accessibility of guns. I share Mayor Grant's antipathy
towards a media that glorifies sex and violence in music and movies, but the
point remains that guns are far too accessible. As your new mayor, I will work
to correct BOTH problems which have been overlooked for far too long." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>There was an instant babble of voices. One then asked, "So
you ARE running for mayor then?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"That is correct," said a proper Mrs. Brand. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The scene changed to Mr. <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>
outside. "Since the District Attorney Marguerite Kramer is doing nothing but
protecting the kids who commit these acts," said <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>,
"it is up to me to do what she will not. Furthermore, I will see to it that all
<span class=SpellE>goths</span>, punks, and antisocial loners with guns are
prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law to get them off our streets. I also
propose to help shut down centers that attract these hoodlums to our area, such
as The Zen and McGrundy's." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen wondered why he didn't make his announcement that he
would be running for mayor. <span class=GramE>Didn't matter much.</span> Helen hoped
he'd be disbarred before long anyway. Finally, she turned it off as the news
went into a report on the stock market, which was still falling. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Daria," said Helen, "you can't go sneaking off anymore. I've
got it from good authority that there are people you don't want to meet who are
curious about you. Like with Quinn, they may think you're drug dealers who aren't
paying a percentage or whatever these people tend to think. Promise me you won't
sneak out of the house again." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I promise not to sneak out of the house again," said
Daria solemnly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen sighed. There was something in Daria's tone that she
didn't like, but she couldn't put her finger on it. "I hope you don't, for your
own sake," she finally said, getting up. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>I didn't say WHICH house I wouldn't sneak out of</i>,
thought Daria without a smile. <i>But I will sneak out of THIS one as I'm going
to have to look into means of disappearing. I'm so sorry, Mom, Dad, but I can't
wait around for this and do nothing to take care of myself.</i> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria, the assigned scapegoat, went up to her own room
then to wonder if she should include Quinn in her plan to run and hide before
she could be sent to prison as some trophy conviction for opportunists like <span
class=SpellE>Fillman</span> or Brand to make mayor on. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>Soon</i>, she comforted herself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=postbody>------------------------------------------ </span><br>
<span class=postbody>03/24/01 SATURDAY 11:00 A.M. </span><br>
<span class=postbody>-------------------------------------------- </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn, lying on her bed as she talked to Sandi on her
cordless phone, was stunned at what she heard. Detective Warner had just left
Sandi's house, after asking Sandi and her entire family what they knew of
Quinn! He'd left, presumably to talk to Tiffany and Stacy, and their families
next (since neither had called Quinn or Sandi yet). Quinn felt ill, and it wasn't
just from the painful throbbing radiating through her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Quinn," Sandi was saying, annoyance in her voice, "I told
you not to date him. And now you have placed the fine reputation of the Fashion
Club in peril." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I know you told me, Sandi, but he was so cute, and I had
no idea! I wish I had listened to you now." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Your arrest has made the Fashion Club look most
unbecoming. And all your friends are now suspects in major crimes. My mom is
all over me for hanging around you after your thing with Matthew and Scott. She
doesn't want you over here." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn laughed weakly and very nervously. "I can't leave
the house anyway," she said, "except for school." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>There was silence for several moments. Then Sandi added, "And
the police may take you away. You have not only brought shame to yourself, but
onto the Fashion Club." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Several more moments before Quinn asked, "Are you kicking
me out, Sandi?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>There was more silence before Sandi replied, "Well, Quinn,
you can stay, but you are most definitely on probation. And you can only date
people after I, President of the Fashion Club, have approved them." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn laughed weakly. She wasn't going on anymore dates in
the near future anyway. "Okay, Sandi." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Nothing is okay about this, Quinn," replied Sandi
testily. "You were almost killed, and you may go to jail or prison. Do you know
what people wear in prison?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn noticed that the question barely bothered her. "Yeah,
Sandi," said Quinn in a tired voice. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Are you okay, Quinn?" Sandi truly sounded concerned. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No," said Quinn. "I'm... Scott hurt me, Sandi. I look
really ugly right now." She was silent for several more moments before she
added, "Mom managed to get me an appointment to see Dr. <span class=SpellE>Baur</span>
at one today." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Do you think you will need plastic surgery?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No," said Quinn, "I don't think so. But my face is... it's
pretty banged up." After several moments, Quinn noticed Daria staring into her
room. She covered the phone with one hand and asked, "What?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I need the phone for a minute," said Daria. "I want to
call Jane." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Okay," said Quinn, before saying into the phone, "Sandi,
Daria needs the phone. I can call you back when she's done." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No, don't call over here," said Sandi. "If my mom finds
out... well, it's just better if I call you." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Oh, well five minutes or so should be fine. <span
class=GramE>Right?"</span> When she saw Daria nod, she added, "Yeah, five." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I think I should call the other members and warn them
about the detective coming over." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Oh," said Quinn. "Okay, then. Bye." She hung up feeling
depressed. "Okay," said Quinn, "phone's yours. Take as long as you want." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria came in and looked at her, making Quinn very
self-conscious. "I heard you hurt him pretty bad back." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yeah," said Quinn. "I can't even believe I did that! It
just happened." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Good," said Daria, the coldness in her voice startling
Quinn. "I'm glad you hurt him, Quinn. I wish I could hurt him, too." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn let out a breath that she had been holding, relieved
that Daria wasn't speaking coldly to her. "Oh, Daria, he's not worth it." She
shook her head. "It's weird. I don't feel like I won or anything. I mean I KNOW
I took care of myself and I should feel good over that, but after the thrill of
it went away, I've just felt tired and beaten ever since." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You're alive. You're whole. What he did do to you will
heal. And that's because of what you did. You didn't even... <span class=GramE>well,</span>
you didn't use a gun to beat him, even if you did shoot at him." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn snorted. "He sure ran when I took his gun from him!"
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"<span class=SpellE>Hmph</span>," said Daria, crossing her
arms. "So you CAN take someone's gun away from them." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn smiled a crooked smile which had an appealing
roguish charm, even if Daria hurt just looking at her face. "I used my charms
and got him close." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"He tried using another gun on you, didn't he?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Another gun?" asked Quinn as if she couldn't believe the
question. "Not just any gun, Daria, it was a SUPER gun!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"A super gun?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I heard Mom's friend call it a super shotgun! Pump AND
automatic! I can't remember anything else about it. But it was LOUD. My ears
didn't stop ringing until after Mom got there!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"<span class=SpellE>Hmph</span>," said Daria, not sure
what to make of that. But she was very glad Quinn didn't have to endure Warner
and Cartwright the way she had. "Well, I better call Jane, so maybe she can
come over here and keep me company while you're away." When Quinn smiled at her
sadly, she added, "And I'm glad you hurt him, Quinn. It's worth something to
me." Then she left to call Jane. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn lay down and almost went to sleep. She felt
comforted as she felt Buffy near. Except for emergencies, Buffy only came
around when she was about to sleep now. "Hi, Buffy," she whispered. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>Hi, Quinn!</i> <span class=GramE>replied</span> Buffy
warmly. <i>Don't worry about the nightmares. I'll keep them away.</i> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yeah," muttered Quinn. She couldn't remember dreaming
anything last night. She just lay down and didn't get up until her mom woke her
for a late breakfast, and to tell her she would be seeing a doctor later today.
She cleared her head and thought at Buffy, <i>I still can't believe everything
that happened last night. And he tried to use some kinda super shotgun on me,
too!</i> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>Yeah</i>, said Buffy, <i>but I made it so it couldn't
shoot!</i> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn smiled a little at that. "Thanks, Buffy," she
muttered out loud, "you're the best." She was asleep almost right after. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She was woken up by her dad a little later. She blinked as
he helped her get up out of bed. He hugged her and she yawned. Then, blinking
groggily, she followed him down the stairs. He looked back at her and smiled
reassuringly more than once. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria was watching some cartoon downstairs. Quinn was
mildly curious, but the pain in her head was too much to think through. <i>It's
funny,</i> she thought, <i>I barely even notice it now, and yet it's still
something that affects me.</i> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Following her dad into the kitchen, she saw her mom in the
process of making sandwiches, with mayo, tomatoes, lettuce, and slices of
cheese. Quinn couldn't remember the last time she had seen her mom do that. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Hey, sweetie," said Helen, "we'll be having sandwiches
soon. And then we'll be leaving. Don't bother doing more than dressing okay. He
won't be looking at your clothes, and makeup will get in the way." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Um, okay," replied Quinn in a low voice. She hadn't even
thought about makeup. She didn't know what to think about that. But while she
was thinking about it, she said, "Mom, I won't ask for a gun, '<span
class=GramE>cause</span> I promised not to--" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Quinn," Helen interrupted, "you don't need a gun. Haven't
you learned that?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Um... no," said Quinn. "But that wasn't what I wanted to
ask. I want to take more classes. I'm not sure what, but I'd like to learn
more." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen smiled nervously. "I think that's a good idea,
Quinn." She lost her smile. "But first you see a doctor! Luckily, Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Baur</span> works weekends, but I still had to work hard and agree
to pay extra to get him to see you today. And we can't be late!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I've been reading that self-defense book we got from that
<span class=GramE>class,"</span> continued Quinn, "and it has some good stuff
in it, but... I need something more." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Okay, Quinn, I will find something out on Monday, okay?"
When Quinn nodded, Helen went into the living room where Daria was still
watching TV. "Quinn is going to some more classes. I think you should go, too."
She let out a breath when Daria just shrugged. "But you're not to leave this
house for anything else." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yes, Warden." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Daria," said Helen, "you're not a prisoner. You're in
protective custody. Remember that." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Luckily, visiting hour is almost upon me." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Going to get her purse, Helen pulled out a twenty. "Here's
to ORDER a pizza. You're not to leave this house, Daria. Jake will be around
and while he may be <span class=GramE>distracted,</span> he hasn't had any
valium today, and won't have any until I get back. So don't even think of
sneaking out!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"He may be awake, but he's still too slow and clumsy to
catch the likes of me and Jane." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Daria," said Helen putting her hands on her hips, "are
you sure you'd rather spend time here with Jane instead of coming with Quinn
and me?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria blinked. "In the house we'll be, and cause no
trouble, you'll see." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Ugh, Daria," said Helen shaking her head, hoping Daria
wasn't planning on becoming a poet. "I left sandwiches in Ziplocs in the top
drawer in the fridge. Should you and Jane prefer something more nutritious than
<span class=GramE>pizza.</span>" She left for the kitchen again then as Daria
rolled her eyes. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria hurried to the door when she heard Jane's knock
moments later. She couldn't keep a smile off her face, though she did manage to
twist it so it looked somehow dangerous. They went up to Daria's room and
ordered a pizza. And for a short while, Daria almost forgot the dire future she
faced. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Then they decided they had better go down to the living
room. Jake wasn't the best person for catching things like pizza delivery men,
at the door. Even when he did answer the door, he might not be coherent and
could end up scaring them away. <span class=GramE>Especially of late.</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Hey," said Jake joining Daria for a little one-on-one
time. He was hip enough to let Jane take part, too. "You're the art chick,
right? <span class=GramE>It's</span> chick now, right?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Actually Dad," said Daria, "it's 'ho' now. <span
class=GramE>As in, 'ho, ho, a hot babe' or something like that." <br>
<br>
"Really?" asked Jake excitedly.</span> "So you're the art ho, right?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane crossed her arms and glared at Daria. "I paint a
little," she said noncommittally. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I did some art back in my day, too," said Jake
reminiscing. "The others, they made fun of me and called me a sissy and a dirty
hippie. But I showed them," his voice was rising, "I married a wonderful ho and
had two beautiful <span class=SpellE>hos</span> for daughters, while those who
made fun of me are dead, or wish they were!" He clenched a fist as he added, "Or
that's one way to look at it, anyway." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Uh," said Jane swallowing, "so, um, what was your best
work?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jake looked confused a moment before he admitted, "I'm not
sure. I was usually tripping when I did something really good. Not that the day
trippers could relate to it. Hey, it is 'tripping' now, right? Where you do
LSD?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"That would be 'charge the battery' today," said Jane
helpfully. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Right," said Jake, "I'd get the most amazing inspirations
when I charged my batteries, and everyone else loved it. Helen especially loved
to charge batteries with me and we'd finger paint some of the exquisite works
of arts with our paints." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"That's, uh, uh," Daria was blushing very red. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Sounds like an interesting time," said Jane with a
straight face. "So you charged your batteries with her, your most beloved ho? <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>UMPH</span></span><span class=GramE>!"</span>
That time, Daria hit Jane in the stomach with her elbow. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You <span class=SpellE>bet'cha</span>!" shouted Jake. "<span
class=SpellE>Ol</span>' Jakey can share some stories of my own youth." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Tell us about the pot and the hooker you did in college,"
suggested Jane. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"What?" asked a disturbed Jake, "how did you know about
that?" He looked truly upset that anyone knew and blushed as Jane smiled at
him, and Daria continued to blush on her own. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria finally sighed and said, "There are a lot of
reporters in town, aren't there, Dad?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jake blinked at the sudden change in conversation and
frowned in displeasure, muttering, "Lousy talking heads always distorting what
I say! Oh, 'can you spare a moment, Mr. Morgendorffer,' well no, I can't!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"... and all kinds of politically active people, too,"
continued Daria the moment Jake paused. "They're going to put a strain on the
market. Maybe you should look into investing with some of the entrepreneurs
that would provide film and tape and other things they would need? Or the local
temp service?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"And escort service?" piped in Jane helpfully. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria glared at her for moment, but returned to her dad
when he said, "You know<span class=GramE>,</span> that's a great idea! Everyone
is into beefing up the security right now, that I don't think many people have
thought of that! Thanks, Daria!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Sure, Dad," said Daria, "I just hope someone isn't
already working on profiting from this situation right now." She spoke a little
more slowly. <span class=GramE>"As we speak.</span> <span class=GramE>Getting a
corner on the market."</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jake's eyes were getting wider and wider. "Say, Daria, do
you think you and Jane can talk amongst yourselves while I make a few calls?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Well, since we're not in the DMZ school, I guess that's
okay," said Jane before Daria could say anything. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Great!" he cried, before trotting upstairs. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"What?" asked Jane innocently as Daria glared at <span
class=GramE>her.</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She sighed. "I never realized how useful all those years
of playing with his head would turn out to be," mused Daria. "All this time I
just thought it was fun." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"But are you sure it wouldn't be more fun to have pulled a
gun and yelled at him to leave?" asked Jane. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Not anywhere as challenging," answered Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Either way," said Jane lightly, "you're due for a karmic
zapping." Jane instantly felt bad for saying that, as she remembered what Daria
was facing. Just then the doorbell rang. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Pizza box in hand, they returned to Daria's room. She
pulled the plug on her phone and put on a <span class=SpellE>CXS</span> CD to
muffle their conversation (without agitating them too much to think clearly)
and asked, "So have you talked to him yet?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane swallowed and shook her head. "It's hard, and the one
time I tried to go, the same car kept turning down streets all around me." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria frowned. <span class=GramE>"Cheap bastards.</span>
They can't even afford more than one tail." She shook her head in disgust,
though she was glad they were that easy to sniff out. "Still," she said, "it's
not like you can't think up a reason to see him." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane blinked and nodded her head. <i>I just don't want to
do it</i>, thought Jane. <i>And if I go with her, I become a criminal along
with her. If I stay, I lose her, and might become a criminal anyway</i>. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Why do you want to run?" asked Jane. "You might get off,
but not if you run." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria stared at Jane awhile before answering. "I won't get
off. The media is trashing me everyday. The jurors know that if they acquit me,
they'll be trashed. Best to just sacrifice me and hope the world is a little
better for it." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"But," said Jane, "your family, your life!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I have no life anymore, Jane," replied Daria. "And all I'm
doing in bringing pain to my family. If I disappear, the media will have a
field day with it. But if I can stay gone, they'll eventually find something
else to blow out of proportion. Someone missing just won't keep the interest of
the sheep. Then it will be over for my family." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"But not for you," said Jane, "or those who love you." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I'm getting burned any way I go, Jane," said Daria. <span
class=GramE>"Might as well end it now.</span> Besides," she added bitterly, "if
I manage to escape, neither <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> nor Brand can make
mayor on me." She shook her head in disgust at how the world worked. She looked
back up to Jane and asked, "Will you help me, or not?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane sighed long and hard. "I'm your friend, Daria. Of
course I'll help." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>While Daria and Jane began discussing plans of an illicit
nature, Jake was eating a sandwich Helen had left him. He put the sandwich down
on a saucer when he heard a loud knock and headed for the door hoping it wasn't
another reporter prepared to take his comments and twist them into something that
would later infuriate Helen. By the time he got to it, it was obviously two
people knocking on it. He couldn't help but be a little nervous, even if it
didn't sound EXACTLY like cops trying to break the door in. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Opening the door, he blinked as he saw two boys Daria's
age on the step. One had thick, blond hair while the other had dark hair and
both were poorly dressed. The dark-haired boy wore an AC/DC shirt, while the
blond wore a <span class=SpellE>Metallica</span> shirt. There was something
disturbing and vaguely familiar about them. But he'd once looked rebellious,
too, and didn't want to act as if he had forgotten all about that stuff. "Hey!"
said Jake, "can I help you, dudes?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Uh..." said the dark haired one, "Yeah. Does <span
class=SpellE>Dia-ria</span> live here?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yeah, yeah, Diarrhea!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>They both chanted, "Diarrhea, cha, cha, cha!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jake didn't know what to make of this and vaguely wondered
if this was another valium-induced dream. "You need the bathroom?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Or your tool shed!" said the excited blond, "<span
class=SpellE>boiiiiinng</span>!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Uh..." said the dark-haired boy. "Dar... uh... Daria?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Oh, Daria!" shouted Jake. Was this some kind of slang
they were using? Or did they have a speech impediment? "You want to see her?
Are you here to have pizza with them?" As the two boys continued to laugh and
mutter to each other, Jake invited them in and yelled up, "Daria! Hey, Daria!
You got more friends!" Jake couldn't believe it. He did hope Daria would pick
up better friends soon. He briefly wondered if Daria met them in jail. <i>That's
ridiculous, she wouldn't be placed in a cell with boys,</i> he thought as he
went back to his sandwich. "Just go on upstairs!" said Jake as he went back
into the kitchen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Snickering, the two ascended the stairs. They heard The <span
class=SpellE>Cruxshadows</span> through a door and stopped. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>Mother of motion, the eyes can't capture time, </i></span><i><br>
<span class=postbody>falling emotion, the blind now lead the blind, </span><br>
<span class=postbody>we commit indiscretions, and omit our sins from sight, </span><br>
<span class=postbody>in a world of intangibles, too many things seem right </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>No hand to scribe, the sinking sickness I have seen, </span><br>
<span class=postbody>no face to judge until you've been the monster I have
been, </span><br>
<span class=postbody>to hunger is noble, where beauty is silent sleep, </span><br>
<span class=postbody>my hunger is noble, but my pain is driven deep. </span><br>

<span class=postbody>Your selfishness, your hatefulness cannot take away my </span><br>

<span class=postbody>Cruelty and consequence cannot eliminate this relevance </span><br>
<span class=postbody>Your selfishness, your hatefulness cannot take away my </span><br>
<span class=postbody>innocence from me</span></i><span class=postbody> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"That music sucks," said the dark-haired boy, "Must be
Daria's room, huh, huh, huh." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yeah, yeah, Daria's room! Heh, <span class=SpellE>heh</span>,
<span class=SpellE>heh</span>! And she's sucking in it, <span class=SpellE>heh</span>,
<span class=SpellE>heh</span>, <span class=SpellE>heh</span>!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Then, as the blond opened the door, they both chanted loud
enough to be heard over the music, "Diarrhea, diarrhea, cha, cha, cha!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria and Jane, both sitting on the bed eating a slice of
pizza, looked toward them in shock. Then Daria's mouth dropped open, and a mix
of anger and confusion crossed her face. She turned the <span class=SpellE>CXS</span>
off and shouted, "What are YOU two doing here!?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The two walked in, chortling still, while Jane continued
to stare wide-eyed. "Your dad said we could like have some of your pizza," said
the dark-haired one. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Whoa," said Jane to Daria, "I think your dad just figured
you out and is giving you some serious payback. Or maybe it's karma?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Both took a slice of pizza and sloppily ate a slice while
the blond one started rummaging through Daria's CDs. "Hey!" shouted Daria to
make them stop, but she was still too stunned to act appropriately. "What are
you doing here!?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"They're here to eat pizza, Daria, don't you listen?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The blond one stopped rummaging through the CDs long
enough to say, "Yeah, we're suppose to ask about guns and bombs and drugs and
stuff." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Shut up, Beavis!" shouted the dark-haired one, slapping
Beavis on the head. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Ow! Cut it out Butt-head!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Where did you come from?" asked Jane with a mix of
caution and curiosity. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"They're from Highland," said Daria annoyed, "and I have
no idea why they followed me here." She looked back at the duo. "Who told you
to ask about all that stuff?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Uh..." started Butt-head. "It was like on TV and stuff." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Hey!" shouted Beavis raising a hand in the sign of the
horns, "<span class=SpellE>Metallica</span>!" He had recognized the cover art
of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold'>Ride the Lightning</span></i>. "Hey!" he shouted again as Daria, still on
the bed, snatched it from him. "Give it back! OW!" The last was from when Daria's
right Doc kicked him in the face, knocking him back. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So you came all the way from Highland to see if I had any
guns or drugs?" asked a disbelieving Daria. "Aren't there enough people in
Texas with that kind of stuff?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yeah," said Butt-head, "but we don't like them." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"<span class=SpellE>Awwwww</span>," crooned Jane brightly
and almost sincerely, "they like you!" Only Daria heard the dark humor
underlying her comment. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yeah," said Beavis, "she has a cool name! <span
class=SpellE>Diarr</span>--" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Do you mind!" shouted Daria. "Damn, you're like 18 and
you're still carrying on as if you were six!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"She said ass," said Butt-head to Beavis. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Beavis chortled a bit and added, "And sucks, too! She said...
sucks ass!" They both started chortling like demented gremlins. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane looked to Daria. "Don't you wish you still had your
gun?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yeah, baby, I have a gun for you, cocked and loaded,"
said Butt-head, drawing a surprised look from Jane and an annoyed one from
Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yeah, yeah," said Beavis. "And what's the deal with the
chick? <span class=GramE>You lesbian or something?"</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Butt-head's eyes went wide. "Cool!" His face went back to
normal. "Just pretend we're not here, baby, and act naturally." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Beavis wasn't done. "Hey, Butt-<span class=GramE>head,</span>
look! Daria's girlfriend doesn't have any tits, either!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I definitely wish I had a gun," said Jane, losing her
patience. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Look," said Daria, "it's been interesting and all, but
this isn't a good time. So if you don't mind, you can take another slice of
pizza, and I'll even give you the <span class=SpellE>Metallica</span> CD, as
long as you go back home right now." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No, no!" shouted Beavis, "I want to see you and the chick
do each other!" He went tense then, with his fists clenched tightly, as he
shouted, "<span class=SpellE>Boinnnnngg</span>!!!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria marched past them angrily and shouted out of the
doorway, "DAD!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Butt-head, only a few feet away, reached out and grabbed
her arm. "Hey, baby, let Butt-head make it all better. OW!" This last as Daria
hit him in the chin with the heel of her hand. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"GET OUT!" Daria wasn't kidding. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Beavis was laughing, "Holy shit! She's a dyke, Butt-head! <span
class=GramE>A total dyke!"</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Butt-head rubbed his chin, frowning. <span class=GramE>"Bitch.</span>
No one treats Butt-head that way." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Beavis chortled some more, looking between Daria and Jane.
<span class=GramE>"Yeah!</span> Daria's like the bitch, '<span class=GramE>cause</span>
she's wearing the dress and stuff! And the chick here is like the guy cause of
her pants and short hair! So, uh, Butch, do you like do Daria doggy-style or
what? Make her get on her knees for you or what?" <span class=GramE>As he
chortled some more, Butt-head joined in with him.</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane reached under Daria's bed until she found the
aluminum bat Daria started keeping there. She stood up brandishing it. "I think
you should leave." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"DAD!" shouted Daria again. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I'm your daddy," said Butt-head, grabbing Daria's arm
again. "Don't make me spank you." Beavis started laughing again. "At least
until I show you <span class=GramE>delights</span> such as you have never known
before." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria saw Butt-head was tense, waiting for her to strike.
So instead she <span class=SpellE>hmphed</span> and stroked his hair with her
left hand. As he moaned and came in closer, she twisted her right arm out of
his light grip and brought her elbow to his face, getting him right on the
nose, causing him to shriek and pull back. Before he got too far, Daria
followed up with a kick to his knee. As he bent reflexively, grasping at his
nose with one hand while reaching down with the other, Daria brought the bottom
of her fist into Butt-head's face in a downward hammer blow. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>"<span class=SpellE>AAAAAA</span>!!!!"</span></span><span
class=postbody> This was from a surprised Beavis who had been too busy laughing
at Butt-head getting his butt kicked by Daria to notice Jane swinging the bat
at the back of his knees. He fell moaning, unable to get back up right away. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>A minute later, Daria, holding Butt-head by his shirt and
hair, and Jane, dragging Beavis by his shirt and ear, were at the front door. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Open it," said Daria coldly to Butt-head in front of her.
Butt-head held both hands over his bleeding nose, and while he wasn't crying,
tears of pain still fell down his face. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No way, dyke," he finally replied. Then Daria shoved his
head into the door. "OW! Cut it out!" Then he twisted his head to try and see a
laughing Beavis behind him. "Shut up, Beavis!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Hey, Daria," said Jane casually, "remember your saying
you wanted to experiment with cock and ball torture?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Butt-head opened the door. Both were taken out on the step
and thrown screaming onto the sidewalk. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"GO HOME!" shouted Daria. She looked up and took a deep
breath trying to calm <span class=GramE>herself</span> when she noticed an old
car parked across the street and down a little ways with two men inside of it.
She swore she could see one of them taking pictures. She was about to say
something to Jane when Jane gave a light cry of surprise. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>A fire engine red 2001 Chevrolet Corvette, about to pass
by, suddenly stopped and parked. Daria touched Jane's arm and nodded to go
inside. They quickly shut the door behind them and went to the front room
window to watch the two cars. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Beavis and Butt-head slowly sat up, moaning. "Beavis, you <span
class=SpellE>dickweed</span>, I was about to score but you kept messing it up
and stuff." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No way, ass munch! You were like getting your ass kicked
by the Daria chick and stuff! I was gonna score with Daria's lesbian
girlfriend, but she like got all mad over you acting like an ass goblin and
stuff! OW!" The last was when Butt-head slapped him. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Shut up, butt monkey... uh, <span class=SpellE>hu</span>,
<span class=SpellE>hu</span>." Butt-head forgot what he was about to say as he
finally saw the Corvette, and the hot babe getting out of the car. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Both boys sat silent as they watched her approach, her
walk seductive. She had long, blonde hair, striking blue eyes, and a figure
that was a perfection of feminine curves. She <span class=GramE>smiled,</span>
the expression seemed both pleasant and threatening. Both boys slobbered as she
slowly approached them. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Suddenly, Beavis's eyes went wide. <span class=GramE>"Hey,
Butt-head!</span> It's that chick! The one we were gonna do in Washington or
Seattle and stuff! The one I lost the picture of!" He scrambled to his feet. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Forget Daria," muttered Butt-head, jumping up beside him,
"we can do her." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Oh, we're gonna 'do' it, all right," said the woman as
she came within touching distance of them. With the speed of a striking snake
she lashed out at Beavis as he came close to her, an upward heel of her palm
that knocked Beavis's head back. She followed that a mere second later with a
punch to the side of his neck, causing his body to suddenly bend over backward
from the angle of the blow, then followed with a knee to his exposed crotch.
Beavis was gasping, down on his knees and clutching his neck with one hand, his
crotch with the other. He fell all the way over as the woman stomped the back
of his head with her right foot, and then slowly twisted into a fetal position.
He continued to twist and thrash as he struggled for breath. This happened all
in the span of five seconds. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Butt-head, done blinking at what he had just seen, lunged
at the woman and tried to punch her. She deftly blocked his clumsy blow with
her left arm, <span class=GramE>then</span> wrapped it around his right arm,
twisting it down while bringing her right elbow up to his throat. He tried to
back away, but she moved her elbow so that her right arm locked at his throat
to the side of his neck, holding him firmly. While he was trying to regain his
equilibrium lost due to the two grips, she brought a foot to his knee, then her
knee up to his crotch. <span class=GramE>Twice.</span> Then she brought the arm
she had been holding at his neck back and lashed out with the palm in an upward
thrust, letting go as she connected. Butt-head fell backwards and sprawled on
the ground, apparently unconscious, his face a bloody mess. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Inside the Morgendorffer home, Daria and Jane, who had
seen everything, stared wide-eyed. "She's going to kill them!" cried Jane in
disbelief, "with her bare hands!" She turned in shock as Daria went to the
door. <span class=GramE>"Hey, where you going!?</span> <span class=GramE>DARIA!"</span>
Daria had run outside. Jane ran after her. All too quickly, they were outside, <span
class=GramE>a mere six or seven feet</span> away from the woman standing over
the prone and injured Beavis and Butt-head. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"They're not worth... it," went Daria. She barely got the
last word out as the woman trained a pistol in her direction. Jane stopped
right beside her. All three women then noticed two men on the street--the ones
that had been in the older car. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Police!" one shouted, pulling his gun. Before he could
get it to bear on the blonde, she had turned to him and two shots from her own
pistol rang out. He fell as one bullet hit him in the head. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The other man, jaw hanging open and fear evident on his
face, clumsily reached for his own side arm as he stared at his fallen partner.
A moment later, when he remembered, it was too late. Three more shots rang out.
His own gun, which he had just pulled, fell when a bullet struck his forearm
beneath the <span class=SpellE>Zylon</span> body armor he wore. Another grazed
the side of his ribs. It hurt like fury. Then the third creased a bloody line
across his cheek. He had no idea how badly he was injured, only that he was
hurt bad. "<span class=SpellE>Fah</span>-give me!" he cried hysterically as he
fell, "<span class=SpellE>fah</span>-give me!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The woman, who had knowingly shot two police officers
without a trace of hesitation, instantly brought her gun back to bear on Daria
and Jane. Both were speechless and accepted that they were about to die as
there was nothing else they could do. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Damn, damn, damn, damn!" shouted the woman with the gun.
Then she smiled cynically at the two younger women staring at her gun with
resignation. "Don't worry, Daria. It was just personal with these two idiot
boys. A debt I owed them. I don't plan to kill them as they'll suffer far more
alive. But I had to show them a little pain. The two cops interfered when they
shouldn't. As long as you both stand perfectly still, I won't shoot you. Bye." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria and Jane just stood rooted to the spot, while one
cop continued to cry in a low, incoherent moan, and Beavis and Butt-head
started moaning softly themselves, still lying motionless on the ground. The
woman with the gun lightly jogged to her car, her gun arm tense. She moved with
the grace of a dancer and <span class=GramE>neither Daria or</span> Jane
doubted that she could aim and fire with deadly precision in a split-second.
She got into her Corvette, spun around to avoid damaging her tires on the
fallen police officers, and sped away. She was obviously as good with a car as
she was with a gun. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The moment she was out of sight, Daria told Jane, "Call an
ambulance!" It didn't occur to her to say, "Call the police." Without stopping
to see what Jane was doing, she ran over to the cop who was still moaning. "You're
going to be all right," she told him as she bent down to see just how badly he
was hurt. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>In a very faint voice, he moaned, "<span class=SpellE>Fah</span>-give
me, <span class=SpellE>faht-er</span>, <span class=SpellE>fah</span>-give me."
He looked at Daria as she took off her jacket and her shirt and began to hold
the shirt against his face. "You," he said softly. "You... should run." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"What?" asked Daria, wondering why a cop should tell her
to do what she was planning <span class=GramE>anyway.</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"They want you, Daria. Not... your <span class=SpellE>fau't</span>.
It <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>wa</span></span>' an accident. But...
they want you now and you need to run! <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Fah</span></span><span
class=GramE>-give me."</span> The words were muttered. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria took in a breath and thought fast. "Why should I
run? What was an accident?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He shook his head, not seeming to be aware of her anymore.
He was fading. "<span class=SpellE>Fah</span>-give me," he almost whispered. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I'm here to hear your last confession," said Daria. She
didn't know much about Catholic last rites, but she guessed that was what this
cop had in mind. And she had to know what he said, as blasphemous as imitating
a priest right now might be! "I need to hear about the accident." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He just muttered, "<span class=SpellE>Fah</span>-give me,"
one last time, almost inaudibly, as he fell into unconsciousness. He still
breathed, but Daria knew he would die if the ambulance didn't get there soon. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane came up to her with some towels. "Your dad's on the
phone with 911," she said breathlessly. "He thinks you're hiding up in your
room. He was so into some call over some money deal that he didn't even realize
what was going on." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria blinked at that, but wasn't surprised. With the
towels, they bandaged up the dying officer as best they could. The wound in the
forearm didn't seem that bad, so Daria canceled her plan to use her shirt as a
tourniquet. Still, she doubted if she would wear it again. She had a couple of
more almost just like it anyway. She suddenly noticed she was wearing nothing
but a bra from the waist up and put her jacket back on. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Two squad cars showed up almost immediately. They came out
with guns drawn, but they put them away and got a first-aid kit when they saw
what was happening. Several more police and a couple of ambulances showed up
not long after. Both cops were alive but in serious condition--one with the head
shot not expected to make it. Beavis and Butt-head, both beaten to a pulp, were
also carted away. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Both Daria and Jane gave as complete a report as they
could, leaving out how they beat up and threw out the two guys themselves,
along with an accurate description of the woman. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria didn't mention that the woman had known her name, a
fact that creeped her out. <i>It's possible she recognized me from the news,</i>
Daria thought, but she had a very bad feeling about it. <i>And why did she let
us, as witnesses, live?</i> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria and Jane even talked to Detective Cartwright. To
their surprise he didn't seem to hold them in any suspicion, and even thanked
Daria for her attempt to help the fallen officer. Daria and Jane both were
bemused by that. News teams showed up, and Daria knew she would be on the TV
again. She hoped they would say something nice about her this time, but
suspected that was a vain hope. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jake had been questioned in the house. When he finally
realized Daria wasn't inside, he came out and ordered her back in. Daria and
Jane both went in. The cops were obviously preparing to do a statewide search
and ignored them. Even though no one could tell them the plate number, a new
model Corvette driven by a "striking" blonde couldn't be that hard to find. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen showed up as the last of the police and reporters
were leaving. She hurried inside. She was stunned at hearing of two cops shot
outside her home, and that Daria and Jane had been held at gun point. She
insisted on Jane having someone pick her up, and Trent came inside for awhile
before she left with him. Helen shared that she'd seen a car following her
almost all the way to the doctor's office, but not on the way back. She didn't
know if they had a better tail on the return drive or if they'd forgotten about
her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Only Daria and Helen were still up when the news came on
later that night. Jake was upstairs, sleeping on a valium, and Quinn was fast
asleep on her own. Daria and Helen didn't say much as they watched the footage.
They heard that the first cop shot had died, and the other was in critical
condition. A drawing and computerized portrait of the woman described was shown
on the screen, already with a reward of $10,000. To Daria's relief, beyond
insinuating that her house was dangerous, the talking heads didn't say anything
about her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>But even Daria and Helen were shocked speechless when they
learned of another homicide that day: Mrs. Brand. From the wounded survivor,
Mr. Preston (the one Daria had suspected was Mrs. Brand's lover), they got that
Mrs. Brand had been driving and they were stopped at a stop sign when a car
pulled up alongside them. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mr. Preston, riding shotgun, hadn't been able to see the
driver. In the passenger seat was a man with long, unkempt blond hair, wearing
a blue-plaid shirt and black bandanna tied over his face. Only his blue eyes
and dirty hair showed. He aimed a short shotgun of some kind out the window and
blew Mrs. Brand away, killing her instantly. Mr. Preston was also wounded when
at least part of the slug went through Mrs. Brand and cut into his arm. He was
expected to make a full recovery. A mostly useless sketch was given of the
shooter, along with the description of an older model car used by the
assailants. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen kept shaking her head. She'd hated Mrs. Brand, but she
hadn't wanted anything like this to happen. <span class=GramE>"What's happening
in this town!?"</span> Helen cried rhetorically. Daria only shook her head and
went upstairs for bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=postbody>------------------------------------------ </span><br>
<span class=postbody>03/26/01 MONDAY 9:00 A.M. </span><br>
<span class=postbody>------------------------------------------ </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Fleming, BATF, entered the meeting room where his
team was assembled, sitting around a table. Agent Bork was already there, the
only one standing, checking the slide projector. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Tell '<span class=SpellE>em</span>, Bork," he said
sitting down at the head of the table. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Bork nodded just before the lights dimmed. He had a
carousel loaded and advanced it to the first slide. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"As most of you know, Daria Morgendorffer was arrested on
multiple charges. The charges we are interested in are the violations of
Project Safe Neighborhoods and Gun Free Zones Act. The details of this are all
in the file. The gun, made by Autauga Arms cannot be traced past its original
sale. It apparently was sold to a 'hobbyist' at a gun show and somehow ended up
in the possession of Ms. Morgendorffer. She used it to fire on the drug dealer
that she claims was stalking her sister, and was, in fact, about to shoot her.
I assume everyone has read the files and seen the footage on this?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>When no one admitted to having skipped this part of the
assignment, Bork continued. "The interesting part is that this girl was trained
to shoot and shoot well by someone unknown at a place unknown. Her gun was also
coated with Teflon to hide fingerprints. It is surmised that she is involved in
the sale or distribution of methamphetamines, and that she has armed escorts
that provide bodyguard service for her. This was particularly helpful to her in
that Matthew Foster, the boy she shot later at Lawndale High, had pulled a gun
on her earlier at a place called The Zen and her armed bodyguards intervened.
And as of Friday, her sister, Quinn Morgendorffer, got into another shooting
with Scott Rhodes, the supposed partner of the young man Daria had shot in her
high school. Quinn was supposedly dating both of them at the time of the shootings."
A few agents laughed lightly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Quinn fired upon him with a <span class=SpellE>Glock</span>
32. We know that it was stolen, but we are not certain if it belonged to Scott
Rhodes or Quinn Morgendorffer. Each claims it belonged to the other. Both left
prints on the gun. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Rhodes attempted to return fire with a <span
class=SpellE>Benelli</span> M3 super 90 shotgun. It belonged to his mother,
Mary Rhodes, who had purchased and registered it seven and a half years ago. <span
class=SpellE>Benellis</span> are expensive, and some are suspicious where she
came up with the money for it, as she is in a low income bracket. She claims to
have 'saved up' for it. She kept the gun, along with a few other firearms,
unloaded but in easy reach in her closet, along with several kinds of
ammunition. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The boy apparently doesn't know much about guns: he tried
using the cheap birdshot ammunition and it failed to cycle. The result was he
was able to get off one shot before the shotgun jammed." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The photo switched to one of Helen. "Here we have a
picture of the defendant's mother, Helen Morgendorffer. A former leftist
activist, she still dabbles in political actions. She was once called 'Hippie
Helen,' or 'Helen the Hippie.' A little over three years ago, she threatened
national security by filing suit against the ATF. She was persuaded to drop the
suit. Her name was flagged in the database." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Another <span class=SpellE>pic</span> was shown, this time
of Beavis and Butt-head. "These two young men, Beavis and Butt-head, were
involved in the incident over which Mrs. Morgendorffer attempted to file suit.
Also involved was a middle-aged neighbor of theirs, Tom Anderson, of Highland,
Texas. He was charged but later released. When we were not able to bring him to
trial, we began to look into other acquaintances of these two boys. There were
few to speak of; one of them is Daria Morgendorffer." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Bork coughed and added, "What only a few of you know is
that these boys were made honorary members of the BATF. I am not at liberty to
discuss the reasons for this, only that these two are much more resourceful and
talented than they appear. They were instrumental in averting a colossal
disaster in an incident that remains classified." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The photo changed to one of Beavis and Butt-head in a
hospital with heavy bruises on their faces. "Because of the former relations
with Daria, the boys were recruited to go in and gather intelligence.
Apparently, Daria ascertained their true motives and beat them to a pulp. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Now, here's where it gets even more interesting." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Bork switched the photo to that of Beavis and Butt-head on
the sidewalk outside the Morgendorffer residence. An annoyed Daria and Jane
look down on them, and Daria is yelling something. "It would seem that Daria
and her associate, Jane Lane, knew the boys were working for us." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Another photo <span class=GramE>switch,</span> and a
picture of a blonde approaching the boys. "Enter Dallas Grimes. We first met up
with her in the incident that Beavis and Butt-head helped us to avert. Her
ex-husband, Muddy Grimes, was holed up in Highland for awhile, although we didn't
know why he went there or whom he met. <span class=GramE>Until now."</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>A mug shot of Dallas Grimes appeared. "We successfully
convicted her of stealing the X-5 Unit, a biological weapon of mass
destruction, from an unspecified Army base..." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Bork!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Um, yes, forget you heard that. Anyway, we never did
learn of her connections or who had contracted the theft. She was sent to
Alderson, a minimum security prison for women in West Virginia--" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Excuse me," asked Agent Riley, "did you say MINIMUM?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Plea bargain," said Agent Bork, "and maybe some tampering
with the judge. We're not sure about that. But she was put under extra guard as
she was known to be a skillful cat burglar and manipulator, not to mention
handy with disguises." Here Bork coughed a bit and asked, "Chief?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Tell '<span class=SpellE>em</span>, Bork," said Agent
Fleming. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yes. Fears of her escape proved to be unfounded. She was
released. The paper trail is muddy, but apparently she was sprung by the CIA.
The CIA, of course, won't answer our questions about why, or even if, it
happened. They simply express a polite ignorance on the matter. Even more
confusing is that one CIA agent in the field asserted to one of our agents that
Dallas Grimes was a bad apple not to be trusted. He also said Dallas Grimes was
not her real name and gave us two other identities, that of Dorothy Gill and
Leslie Slate, both with documentation. However, she has used these identities
only infrequently, and the electronic footprints are few and confusing. At this
time, we don't know what alias she is going by, or what she is doing, or if she's
even working with the CIA, someone else, or herself." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Excuse me, sir," said Agent Bentley, just a little
nervously. "Are you saying this woman now works for a <b>kid</b>?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Bork blinked at that. "Unknown, but the two young men told
Agent Butler that they were attacked by all three females. However, it's more
likely Dallas Grimes works for someone else but receives her orders through
Daria." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Bentley shook his head. "I'm sorry, but this is just
too unbelievable." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Agent Bentley," said Agent Fleming, "do you have any idea
what kids these days are capable of? Don't you read the papers?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"A girl has a bad day and shoots up a school is one thing,
but a girl that commands a criminal operation with armed bodyguards involving
drugs and weapons and employing CIA spooks is another matter." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Agent Bentley," said Agent Fleming, making a note to
recommend Agent Bentley not be promoted for such insights, "I suggest you talk
less and listen more. The security of our nation is at stake here." He turned
back to Bork and demanded, "Tell '<span class=SpellE>em</span>, Bork!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yes," said Agent Bork, a little nervously himself. "The
reason we have delayed pressing charges on Daria is that she faces more serious
consequences by the local laws. More importantly, we're hoping to find her
source. Sooner or later she's going to go to him, or her." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Shouldn't this be a matter for the DEA then?" asked Agent
Riley. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The DEA is more concerned with pot and cocaine.
Methamphetamine is mostly done by drug dealers that specialize in <span
class=GramE>it</span>." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Even so," said Agent Riley, "this seems to be more
involved with drugs than weapons." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Bork took a deep breath. "It gets even more
interesting." Taking another breath, he hit the button again six times. Each
mug shot showed a man of Middle Eastern appearance. Bork read off the names of
each. "They were intercepted by FBI after attempting to make a deal to buy
samples of diseases from CDC. More importantly, they were found with several
bomb-making materials, including large quantities of anhydrous ammonia, lye, <span
class=SpellE>hydriodic</span> acid, ethyl ether, hydrochloric acid, and
toluene. Many of you are familiar with these and know that, like Teflon,
several innocent domestic products and uses are known for these chemicals.
However, they can all be used for criminal, and murderous, purposes. And when mixed
together, you have all that you need for methamphetamines." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Bork saw he had the team's interest with mentioning
the chemicals and fertilizers, but some were furrowing their brows again at the
word methamphetamines. He decided to get to the point. "During interrogation,
the suspects all claimed to have gotten the materials from methamphetamine
dealers in Virginia--" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Lawndale?" interrupted Agent Bentley again, skepticism
still evident in his voice. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Newport," corrected Bork. "Further investigation and
anonymous tips to the BATF have shown evidence of an organized effort to
corrupt the police and politicians throughout Virginia, and even in DC. The <span
class=SpellE>M.O</span>. is similar to that of the Mafia, using standard
bribery and blackmail, but these people seem to consider <span class=GramE>themselves</span>
separate from the mob, led by a shadowy individual referred to as 'Wild Card'.
For unknown reasons, they seem to have an interest in vice cops especially.
Even more disturbing is the assertion that they are willing to ignore certain
long standing, unspoken agreements, such as refusing to do contract killings on
police officers and politicians. And they're also willing to do contract
killings on drug lords and Mafia figures. People on either side of the law can
apparently make deals with them to kill individuals and set off bombs. There
have been minor busts, but the greater organization behind it remains a
mystery." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Riley asked, "So it's a job for the FBI then?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Another click showed a <span class=SpellE>pic</span> of a
restaurant called The Thai House. "Using the information gained, FBI raided a
meth lab that was hidden under a Thai restaurant. It seems the smells of the
solvents were piped out along with the cooking, and the owners had a lot more
cash than their business was making. Still, no one suspected a meth lab
operating underneath the restaurant, until the apprehended terrorists revealed
the information to the FBI during interrogation." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"FBI, then," said Agent Riley. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Several accelerants not used in the production of
methamphetamines were also found. The same kind of accelerants used in some
recent firebombings, including that of multiple churches, not to mention
suspicious insurance claims. More disturbing are several new forms of
methamphetamines called 'Ice Cold' that are quickly being labeled CDS." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"CDS?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Controlled Dangerous Substance." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"DEA, then," said Agent Riley. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The CDS and methamphetamines seem to be part of the
operation, but not the operation itself. The actual operations seem to be the
arson, criminal and political violence for a price, and the smuggling of bombs
and firearms and methamphetamines." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Riley asked, "Why isn't the DEA handling this from
the drug angle?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"They use informants like everyone else. The informants
trade information on their rivals for getting the competition off the streets.
In return, the cops who bust the competition rack up a lot of arrests. This
works to the benefit of both the officers and the criminal informants: the
officer has a good arrest record; the criminal gets rid of his competition and
avoids arrest himself. Regrettably, personal chemistry often develops out of
this alone that compromises the officer's dependability to enforce the law." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Add to this that some are dumb enough to partake of the
drugs, particularly those working undercover," added Agent Fleming, "and the
gift giving common in business deals, as well as the blackmail that can easily
arise out of such situations, and you have a lot of compromised officers." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"How bad is it?" asked Agent Bentley. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Unknown," said Agent Bork, "but it seems to be getting
worse. And a DEA agent recently died from snorting too much of the new 'Ice
Cold'." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Those looking into the evidence rooms of the DEA report
that missing evidence is common," stated Agent Bentley, "so how do we know this
just isn't business as usual?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"We don't," said Agent Fleming, "but this is one stone we
can't afford to leave unturned!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I should also point out," said Agent Bork, "that multiple
federal agencies have undercover agents investigating this right now. <span
class=GramE>Probably along with the local police."</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Bentley added, "And we don't know how many have been
compromised." It was a statement, not a question. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Not only that," said Agent Bork, "but those who haven't
been compromised <span class=GramE>are</span> still ineffectual for this
investigation. Why pursue a tough case when you get paid the same to monitor
meaningless intelligence that allows you leisure, as well as a greater chance
of living long enough to collect retirement?" Shaking his head, he added, "The
DEA, IRS, and FBI are particularly notorious for lackadaisical investigations."
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"It gets worse," said Agent Fleming, slapping the table
once. "Tell '<span class=SpellE>em</span> about the runners, Bork." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Bork cleared his throat. "Local police officers
working their informants have repeatedly stumbled across CIA operations running
into Central America, something Dallas Grimes is said to have participated in
herself years ago. While the informants are typically criminal, they are also
ordinary civilians for the most part." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"If civilians," interjected Fleming, "can tell who the CIA
are, not to mention can acquire the same informants, possibly through
compromised officers and agents, then any foreigner could use this network to
launch attacks on America's intelligence agencies. More importantly, successful
attacks would inspire attacks on other agencies. I'm sure I don't have to point
out that we here at the BATF are considered particularly noxious by some
extremists right here on American soil." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So we will be taking over this investigation?" asked
Agent Riley. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The FBI and DEA are conducting their own investigations.
The BATF has been invited to play in this game because of the weapons and
crimes involved. And because we are the ones who have the anonymous tipper who
has never steered us wrong." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"What's in it for this informer?" asked Agent Bentley. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Bork didn't know, and that made him nervous. But
instead of saying that, he said, "The informant is a person who uses a voice
modulator to disguise his or her voice, and never speaks for more than a single
minute. This informant managed to attain Agent Fleming's private cell phone
number, which suggests he or she is an agent in the field who doesn't trust the
agency he or she works for. So far, the information has always proved accurate.
And then there's Daria Morgendorffer." Bork flicked the switch to show another <span
class=SpellE>pic</span> of Daria. "Our informant told us to watch Daria and
Dallas Grimes would show up, who could lead us to 'Wild Card' if we made her a
deal." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Okay," said Agent Bentley, "you have this Daria
Morgendorffer involved with some shady characters. But is there anything other
than this informant that makes you think she's with 'Wild Card' and his group?"
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Daria Morgendorffer claimed to have obtained her gun from
a gun show in Newport, Virginia. Yet we had agents there and none recall seeing
her. There is, in fact, no evidence that she even went there. But she still
knew details of Newport's activities. So surely she went. Can you see where
this is going?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>There was some muttering, but one asserted, "Coincidence?"
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Maybe," said Bork. "But according to our tipper, there's
a much bigger stake at play. The methamphetamine is not only to build capital
for the greater operation until it's self-sustaining, but to create addicts that
serve as expendable assassins. That's the beauty of it. The hit man doesn't
know the target and doesn't care. They barely know the person who gives them
their drugs. It's essentially a re-creation of the assassins of the Old Man of
the Mountain, killers that were devoted to him due to their dependence on
hashish and other drugs. Not too mention that today this 'Ice Cold' gives the
users feelings of megalomania and rage." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"How does this group get established in an area?" asked
Agent Bentley. "And how do people employ their services?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"By aggressively replacing local meth dealers and
supplanting them," said Agent Bork. "They then put the word out. The FBI has
already made a handful of busts of people who agreed to pay for assassins and
arsonists, but none of the busts could go any higher. It seems the cabal itself
uses a lot of disguises and unlikely representatives--like Daria Morgendorffer
perhaps--that leave packages of material off while dressed as a delivery person,
or drop off cards with pictures and addresses of targets." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Then Agent Bork flicked to a new <span class=SpellE>pic</span>,
this one of a man in cuffs, escorted by federal agents. "Posing as members of
this new underground reality, FBI agents were contacted by a Mr. Wayne Miller,
who wished to blow up the 'mom &amp; pop' store he ran with his wife in
Washington DC, so he could end his marriage, get out of business at the same
time, and collect an insurance settlement to boot." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He shook his head. "In order to avoid suspicion, he
requested the entire block be blown up! He expected to be able to buy this!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Sounds like a nut to me," said Agent Riley. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"FBI posed as such agents based on the information that
others out there are offering such services for sale, right in our nation's
capital. <span class=GramE>All the evidence points to a new player, one not
bound by the old rules.</span> This new player could generate chaos, violence,
and anarchy on an unprecedented scale. And the worse it <span class=GramE>gets,</span>
the more money they stand to make. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Interrogation also showed that this group was willing to
do favors without regard to the unspoken agreements between law enforcement and
organized crime. For example, contract killings against police officers aren't
allowed by most crime families, who attempt to maintain courteous, if not
friendly, relations with the police. This group doesn't care about that. And
they're willing to take jobs--from Colombians to Mid-East terrorists, from
neo-Nazis to the CIA. We've already found members of the Russian and Serbian
mobs buying and selling weapons, and the FBI claim to be watching a member of
the <span class=SpellE>Camara</span> family seeking to do business... though
whether the <span class=SpellE>Camara</span> family is sincere in wanting to do
business or trying to sniff out the competition for retaliation is unclear. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"In the words of one, 'Wild Card' is an example of American
free enterprise in action; he sees a service that others are willing to pay for
and he provides it. As Wild Card is taking over the market, he can charge
exorbitant fees for his services." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So, is this Daria involved in selling this 'Ice Cold'?" asked
Agent Bentley. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So far," said Agent Bork, "no 'Ice Cold' has been found
in Lawndale. But the local alpha for methamphetamines is nervous because he
claims someone is intruding on his territory, winning his lackeys away." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"If he's a user, maybe he's just paranoid," said Agent
Bentley. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"That's not an IF we can afford to trust in," interrupted
Agent Fleming. <span class=GramE>"Especially as Lawndale is experiencing a
dramatically increased murder rate this year!"</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Do you think the local alpha might have something to do
with it?" asked Bentley. "After all, maybe he's Daria's boyfriend, which could
explain nearly everything else around Daria." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The FBI is investigating Garfield Edwards, a.k.a. 'Evil
Eddie'" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Riley asked, "So what are the other drug lords and mobsters
saying about this?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Methamphetamine dealers are normally separate from your
other dealers. The trade seems to be dominated by the alternative white
subcultures, particularly the 'biker' people. Most dealers use their own
product and are prone to unpredictable and violent rages. The labs can often be
found by the smell <span class=GramE>alone,</span> and if not by the pungent
smell, then by the dead plants and wildlife in the immediate area around the
meth lab." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Bentley asked, "Why aren't more drug lords and crime
families into this market?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The more organized crime families usually avoid these
drugs as it entails more risks and less profit than the other drugs," replied
Agent Bork. "When they do involve themselves, dealers are more prone to robbing
and killing each other--another reason for the more cautious and organized
criminal to avoid <span class=GramE>it</span>." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So how are these drugs different from the, uh, more
standard drugs?" asked Agent Bentley. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"One quarter of a gram will keep a newbie, ahem, 'rocking'
for about 48 hours, or more, and is sometimes called the 'poor man's coke.' It's
also more addictive than either coke or heroine. Crystal meth is the favored
form for <span class=SpellE>snorters</span>, ether-based meth for shooters.
Shooters will often work out deals with diabetics to buy needles, which they
refer to as 'rigs,' but also as 'points' or 'darts'." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"At least is sounds easy to catch," said Agent Riley. "Why
not hunt down the meth labs, kick ass, and take names?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"More and more, meth labs are becoming mobile. They will
make one batch and move their lab. Meth labs are also frequently guarded by
booby-traps of a chemical nature, and sometimes by attack dogs that are almost
insane from having methamphetamines used on them." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Riley nodded. "So these chemicals are a growing
menace in Virginia, despite the risks in creating and using these
methamphetamines?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Bork nodded. <span class=GramE>"Not to mention that
this new 'Ice Cold' showing up in Virginia is the most addictive and
long-lasting yet, and also more prone to driving people to berserk rages and
delusions of grandeur." <br>
<br>
"Did this Scott Rhodes sell this new 'ice'?" <br>
<br>
"No.</span> If 'Ice Cold' is in Lawndale, it hasn't been found yet." <i>Unless
Wild Card already owns Lawndale's vice cops,</i> thought Bork. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Bork switched the <span class=SpellE>pic</span> again and
this time a mug shot Jim Foster appeared on the screen. "This is Jim Foster,
whom you also have read the files on, the father of the young man Daria
Morgendorffer shot, the man with an arsenal in his cabin. Connected, at least
peripherally, to multiple white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups, he becomes
another link. Especially in that one of the neo-Nazi groups, close to Newport,
have a taste for the new 'Ice Cold.' The FBI busted three such people in
Newport not long ago trying to make contact with the group under investigation."
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So if this is a neo-Nazi group" asked Agent Bentley, "why
are they selling to Muslim terrorists then?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Bork shook his head, though few saw him do it. "Whoever 'Wild
Card' and his cabal are, they are businessmen first and foremost. They see a
market and provide for it. They sell death and destruction to anyone who can
pay, be that person a native or foreign terrorist, of any ideology. They seem
to be reaching out to such extremist groups, however, and it's interesting that
the father of the boy shot by Daria Morgendorffer, and dated by Quinn
Morgendorffer, was connected to one of those groups." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yes, sir," said Agent Bentley, "it is. But I can think of
other explanations that sound more likely. All except for Dallas Grimes showing
up." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Bork nodded. "On the night of the beating of our
operatives, two Lawndale police officers attempted to intervene and both were
shot by Dallas Grimes. One was killed by a well-placed shot in the head. The
other suffered a grazing wound to the head, another to the forearm, and the
poorly cared for soft body armor made with <span class=SpellE>Zylon</span> was
hit and penetrated by one bullet. However, Ms. Grimes was obviously aiming for
the head, and maybe even the hand. <span class=GramE>" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I know this," said Agent Bentley. "Do you think Dallas
Grimes is the one who armed Daria and taught her how to shoot?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Unknown," said Bork, "but what is known is that she shot
those officers with Teflon-coated <span class=SpellE>KTW</span> bullets." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>There was some muttering over that. <span class=SpellE>KTWs</span>
were illegal for civilians to use due to their armor piercing qualities. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"About the very same time, in Lawndale two unknown white
males, faces and arms covered up and wearing <span class=GramE>gloves,</span>
drove up beside Mrs. Brand, nationally active in Handgun Control, Inc., and
opened fired with a .20 gauge shotgun using slugs. The car the killers used was
found the next day. It had been stolen just the day before and given false
plates. Mrs. Brand had just announced that she was running for mayor shortly
before the hit. More importantly, she was dedicated to bringing Daria
Morgendorffer to justice and apparently had a heated disagreement with her a
few days before." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Maybe the killer at large is this 'Evil Eddie'?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No, Evil Eddie was under surveillance at the time of the
slaying. This is someone different." He paused a moment. "The car was stolen
from Newport." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I see what you're saying, sir," said Agent Bartlett, who
was obviously disturbed by this revelation, "but are you sure it's enough? Why
don't we just go in, clean up, and pass on whatever information we find to the
FBI and let them deal with it?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Agent Bartlett," interrupted Agent Fleming , "are you
willing to leave our national security to accountants with delusions of being
streetwise? Are you aware of the chaos a bunch of drug-crazed and completely
deniable assassins seeming to strike at random could have? Especially in DC?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Kill the head," added Agent Bork, "and the body will
fall." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Several blinked at that. "You mean we're dealing with
revolutionaries?" asked Agent Bentley. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"It hardly matters," said Agent Fleming. "Anyone can buy
political violence with deniable assets for assassins. Revolution is what's for
sale, whether it's ordered or not. Not even the President of the United States
himself is safe." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Especially," added Bork, "because he seems to be so
unpopular, with accusations of stealing the election haunting his presidency."
Bork swallowed. "And with the growing disrespect for authority by the people
whom the government serves... well, extremists might finally get their way." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Not only that, but in Langley, Virginia," added Bork, "our
tipper has said a few were disaffected CIA agents, who hold a grudge against
America, and the CIA in particular. And as it stands, even two-bit vice cops
come across drug- and gun-running schemes supposedly done by the CIA. They are
ignored for a variety of reasons, but once found--and they're easy to find once
you've got a good informant--then the damage done to the CIA, and to the rest of
us as a result, could be incalculable." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Bentley asked, "Doesn't the CIA have its own
defenses?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The CIA is fucked up," said Agent Fleming in disgust. "They
couldn't find their own ass with a flashlight. They use the Top Secret label
for purely bureaucratic purposes while refusing to 'flag' serious reports of
terrorist activities with it. Even their web site has been hacked and crashed
by hackers who <span class=GramE>are most likely kids</span> pulling a prank.
No, it's up to us to stop this menace threatening our nation." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"How?" asked Agent Bartlett. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>"By finding Dallas Grimes.</span></span><span
class=postbody> According to our tipper, Dallas Grimes is in the inner-circle
of this cabal. And to find her--" Bork flicked the switch repeatedly, showing
the <span class=SpellE>pic</span> of Daria, Jane, and Dallas Grimes standing
over Beavis and Butt-head, "we go where Daria Morgendorffer goes." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Everyone," added Agent Fleming, "this is top priority!
The President of the United States wants constant appraisal of the situation!
We're to find Dallas Grimes and bring her in, preferably without the CIA
knowing about it. To find her, we will watch the Lanes and the Morgendorffers. <span
class=GramE>Especially Daria Morgendorffer!"</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Somehow, Agent Fleming managed to say that with enough
gravity that even Agent Bentley lost his skepticism. Everyone got up to prepare
to go to Lawndale. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Everyone, get your gear," added Agent Fleming just before
he left to prepare himself, "we're going to Lawndale and kick some ass!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=postbody>----------------------------------------- </span><br>
<span class=postbody>03/26/01 MONDAY 3:00 P.M. </span><br>
<span class=postbody>------------------------------------------ </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The Russian was mad about something. She tried calming him
down. "<span class=SpellE>N'yee</span> <span class=SpellE>byeespahKOYtyeess</span>!"
she said over and over. But he kept talking faster and faster. <i>Damn! Why
does the Russian tongue have to be as fucked up as English?</i> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Well, the English and Russian speaking people had been
exposed to enough alien cultures, it shouldn't be much of a surprise, but it
was frustrating now. "Look!" she said, but stopped as he blinked in confusion,
his annoyance still there. She sighed and slowly said, "<span class=SpellE>GahvahREET</span>
<span class=SpellE>zhyehs</span>' <span class=SpellE>KTOnyeebood'pah</span> <span
class=SpellE>ahnGLEEskee</span>?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Fuming silently, he turned and stalked away. After a few
steps, he began cussing in Russian. <span class=SpellE>Dara</span> caught the
gist of it anyway. <span class=SpellE>Dara</span>, known to the BATF as Dorothy
Gill, Leslie Slate, and Dallas Grimes, sighed and glanced around the bleak but
busy chop shop. She was in the quieter section, near the office and away from
most of the noise. <i>The Russians can be intense she observed, but they can be
really useful when you get them on your side, too.</i> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She had been dropped off here after getting back to
Newport; she'd abandoned the Corvette in Lawndale, turning it over to Russian
operatives. She had planned the entire assault and realized from the beginning
that she might need to ditch her car. Since the only reason she had gotten the
Corvette was to be recognized as Dallas Grimes by the BATF, this was of little
concern to her. She'd had a member of <span class=SpellE>Borislav's</span>
group ready with an auto transport, and the Corvette was probably already
shipped out of the country by now. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>Russians are quite good with shipping cars to other
countries,</i> she thought with some assurance. She smiled remembering that
cars were smuggled into Russia, too, and that the cars often had other
contraband <i>in</i> them, because the border guards "aren't looking for cars,
which were taken care of by someone else." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She herself had been dropped off at a mobile meth lab that
had just made a batch of Ice Cold in Lawndale and was now ready to be moved
back near Newport. While in the lab, she had gladly dissolved the long blonde
wig in anhydrous ammonia, since it had served its purpose of identifying her to
the BATF. Now her hair was chestnut brown, shoulder length, and curly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Unfortunately, last time she was here in <span
class=SpellE>Borislav's</span> chop shop, she had still appeared to be a
blonde. Her change in appearance now spooked some of <span class=SpellE>Borislav's</span>
workers. Even worse, the Russian who met her was belligerent and paranoid. <span
class=GramE>And didn't seem to speak English at all.</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>It was only a few minutes later, when an older, overweight
man in an Armani suit came down. With him were four <span class=SpellE>rebyata</span>,
the elite bodyguard favored by those who could afford them, who looked at her
the way snakes look at a mouse. This was <span class=SpellE>Borislav</span>. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She had only met him a couple of times when she was
escorting Wild Card, but she relaxed a little. His English wasn't great, but
between his understanding of English and hers of Russian, they should be able
to communicate. And he was ever the businessman first. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She also had an understanding with his "faction" (for want
of a better word) of the <span class=SpellE><i>organizatsiya</i></span> in
Russia, having done a job for them in Moscow, having a secure <span
class=SpellE><i>offshorski</i></span> in Latvia that she got with their help,
and giving them a percentage when she used Vladivostok to meet with Chinese and
Japanese interests for weapons smuggling. She had delivered weapons to them on
more than one occasion, but that had always been in the States. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>As usual, <span class=SpellE>Borislav</span> seemed
friendly enough, if a little patronizing. After getting her to sit in a chair,
he sat beside her, put a half-smoked cigar to his lips and lit it up. He pulled
another cigar out of another pocket and offered it to her. "<span class=SpellE>SeeGAHro</span>?"
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No," <span class=SpellE>Dara</span> replied as calmly as
she could. <i>I'm not gonna say, 'Nyet'</i>, she thought with annoyance. <i>I
know you can speak some English, so do so!</i> She thought it, but did not say
it. One could be casual with <span class=SpellE>Borislav</span> if one were profitable.
But one NEVER gave him an order. Not more than once anyway. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He sneered. "You probably like <span class=SpellE>Amereecanskeyah</span>
<span class=SpellE>seegaritti</span>, too, eh?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She shook her head. "I don't smoke." <i>Why <span
class=GramE>is it</span> so many people assume I do?</i> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He raised his brows in surprise at that and then shrugged.
"Your loss," he said in much clearer English, if still heavily accented. "Forgive
me for my smoke, but you, my dear, need a bath." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Dara</span></span><span class=postbody>
smiled in bitter understanding. Some of the chemical smell from moving the
mobile meth lab still lingered about her. <i>Worse than used cat litter,</i>
she thought, <i>'Ice Cold' might be one of the hottest things on the streets
right now, but it sure does stink!</i> "If you need help in finding some locals
for a translator, I can find someone for you." She said that as politely as she
could, nodding her head to him, as if offering to do him a favor. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No, no," he said with a heavy accent, "I'll be <span
class=SpellE>goot</span>. My current interpreter is in your DC, among your <span
class=SpellE><i>nomenklatura</i></span>." He shrugged. "I'm still learning
English, but I have more to learn. So, Darya, how may I help you?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"It's <span class=SpellE>DARA</span>, not Daria." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"My apologies, <span class=SpellE>DARA</span>. How may I
help you, Darya?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Have you got my car yet?" she asked. It wouldn't do to
force the name issue. <span class=SpellE>Dara</span> was a masculine name in
Russian, so of course he insisted on using Darya. After all, Russians were
often as egotistical as many Americans when it came to thinking they were the
highest standard to which the rest of the world should aspire. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>"Ah, straight to business.</span></span><span
class=postbody> I like that," he said. "Your order is peculiar. <span
class=GramE>A 1996 Ferrari and a 1990 Subaru.</span> Both can be gotten, but it
will take a little more time." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I hope you got the Corvette to Europe already." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Lenin... St. Petersburg," he said jovially. <span
class=GramE>"A <span class=SpellE>geeft</span> for my... nephew?"</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She nodded her understanding, and smiled a roguish grin at
him. "Just don't let the American cops find it," she said. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He laughed. "No, we own police there, and your laws don't
apply to us." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>They're not my laws,</i> she almost spat out before
clamping down on her tongue. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>What was frustrating was that she recently traded in her
old Mustang as part of the deal for the Corvette. Too bad, but she'd had to get
rid of the Mustang after she'd gunned down a meth dealer who turned out to be a
popular biker and the other bikers had pursued her. She'd managed to get away,
but she was sure they had seen and memorized her tags. She'd had to get rid of
it. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Her hair had been red then and she had fake freckles on
her face at the time of the hit, not to mention being dressed like a biker
chick. But changing her appearance wouldn't do much good if they caught her in
her old car. She'd expected to have at least one of the cars she'd ordered by
now and she seethed with frustration. Silently, of course, it had to be kept
hidden from <span class=SpellE>Borislav</span>. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"What <span class=SpellE>happent</span> to your... your,"
he motioned helplessly at her own, non-wig, hair. "Uh, <span class=SpellE>Kraseevee</span>?"
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Beautiful," she supplied. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yes. <span class=GramE>Your beet-<span class=SpellE>ee</span>-full
hair?"</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She smiled at him. "Don't you like my short, brown hair? I
can always get another blonde wig when I need it." <i>Besides</i>, she thought
to herself, <i>that unmanageable Barbie hair, my own or the wig I just used,
already served its purpose. I'm so glad to be rid of it!</i> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He shrugged. "Your long, blonde hair was truly stunning." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She smiled a little flirtatiously at him. "Maybe I should
get another wig. Right now I don't have a car and I might have to ask others
for a ride." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Borislav</span></span><span
class=postbody> twisted his lips and then snapped his fingers and said, "Since
we art slow, I <span class=SpellE>vill</span>, uh, grant you a car of your
choosing. <span class=GramE>Bonus!"</span> Whether a Russian was cruel or kind,
they tended to be magnanimous about it. <span class=GramE>Which is one reason
they made such good friends and terrible enemies.</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>They got up and he led her into a large garage. Several
men gave her menacing or appraising looks. Despite her instinctive fear,
feeling the violence in these men, she looked as calm as <span class=SpellE>Borislav</span>,
a no small figure in the Russian <span class=SpellE><i>Organizatsiya</i></span>
(or, more honestly put, <span class=SpellE><i>Mafyia</i></span>), did beside
her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She didn't doubt he'd pay a small fortune for the X-5 Unit
if she cared to get it back (assuming someone else hadn't stolen it by now--and
that American agents hadn't stolen it back, or something deadlier). She'd heard
they'd even bought some nukes from renegade agents. Or, supposedly renegade
agents. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She stopped. A 1995 Toyota Supra Turbo! <span class=GramE>Perfect
for her disguise as a Middleton student.</span> She hadn't enrolled under an
alias yet, but she could work at setting it up. <span class=GramE>A rich girl
who had been bumming around in Europe and now looking to get into an easy
college and find a man.</span> Yes. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I want that one," she said. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Borislav</span></span><span
class=postbody> laughed. "Fine, fine, it's yours! Happy now, my <span
class=SpellE>beety</span>?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Very," she said sincerely, not even minding his atrocious
accent anymore. The two specific cars she ordered were also essential to her
plans. And now with a third useful car thrown in as a bonus, this was going to
be an amazing deal for her. <i>I just hope the other cars get here within the
week! But I don't dare bitch too much about it.</i> She turned her eyes from
the car back to him and said, "I can't wait for the other cars, too. Let me
know when they arrive. And if there's anything I can do for you." <i>I hope I'm
not too blatant,</i> she thought too herself critically. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"It's no problem," he said smoothly. "I know how much you
need car." He turned from her and barked in Russian. Shortly a man scurried
down and handed him an envelope. He handed it to her and said, "Here is
everything you need. <span class=GramE>Papers, keys, and more.</span> Now if
you will excuse me, Miss Daria, I am a very busy man." He smiled and nodded to
her and turned away as <span class=SpellE>Dara</span> returned the smile and
nod, silently shrieking, <span class=GramE><i>It's</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>DARA</span>!</i> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The car was but a small part of her disguise, like the
hair, the clothes, and everything else. To keep from being sniffed out was a
matter of how you walked, moved, talked, ate your food, what words you used,
and a thousand other small things. She couldn't even think of it all
consciously. She could only "absorb and store personas" which she triggered by
some kind of shtick like a phrase, facial tic, hand motion, or similar act to "activate"
the desired persona. In her line of work, it was an essential skill for
survival. And anyone that survived in the field with the CIA, or even in its
office politics, learned this skill early on. It was especially useful when you
were being hunted by several officers and agents of the law. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She frowned briefly and checked the seatbelts. She had an
irrational fear that they had been cut out, but they were there. Some Russians
hated seatbelts, and to wear one in the car was to insult the driver, or to say
you couldn't drive. <i>Stupid,</i> she thought. <i>I trust myself, but there
are OTHER idiots I don't trust out there.</i> Deep down she knew she checked
because she hated how others had always tried to control or limit her, and thus
she dreaded a Russian cutting her seatbelt out just so she couldn't use them. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Shaking her head at her own petty (but not unreasonable)
paranoia, she drove out of the garage door that had opened for her. On the
street, she pulled her <span class=SpellE><b>Queensryche</b></span>: <i>Operation
<span class=SpellE>Mindcrime</span></i> out of her vest pocket and put it in as
she began to make her rounds. Not long after she was at a part she loved and
turned it up: </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>Hey Nikki you know everything </i></span><i><br>
<span class=postbody>That there is to do </span><br>
<span class=postbody>Here's a gun take it home </span><br>
<span class=postbody>Wait by the phone </span><br>
<span class=postbody>We'll send someone over </span><br>
<span class=postbody>To bring you what you need </span><br>
<span class=postbody>You're a one man death machine </span><br>
<span class=postbody>Make this city bleed</span></i><span class=postbody> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She loved this tape about a gullible kid turned idealistic
revolutionary, only to learn how the world really works. She'd never been much
of an idealist herself, but she could still relate to some of it. And what she
couldn't, well... it amused her. Especially with all the idealists and zealots
and other fanatics that she'd dealt with lately, all of them wanting to inflict
violence on others for high-minded reasons. They weren't just amusing fools,
but useful tools. </span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She had learned about the ugly cruelties of the world from
an early age, long before she was recruited by the CIA. And it wasn't from a
love of country, or even a love of power and excitement. It was simply because
she had been effectively drafted. Luckily, even the CIA didn't know her as '<span
class=SpellE>Dara</span>,' unless they found out through Wild Card. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Dara</span></span><span class=postbody>
wasn't the name she was born with. Oh, no. But it was her true name. When she
had been named by her parents, she had belonged to them, and through them, had
belonged to their system as just another lamb to be fleeced. Now, she was
invisible, and was no longer that poor, wretched girl from Texas. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She'd learned early that there was no one to take care of
her but herself. Both at home and on the streets she was at the mercy of
someone else. And some authority figure was always there ready to burn her. It
started with her Uncle Rob and Grandpa and ended with Administrator Wilson. And
all those people had names for her, names (or even a number) given to her like
a pet who must do her master's bidding. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She hated them all. The so-called "authorities" preached a
good game but were among the lowest of lowlifes. Yeah, her family would protect
her from molestation and exploitation--except for the exploitation and
molestation that went on within the home. School was the same. And finally, so
was the government which preached that it protected humanity from itself while
exploiting humanity in every fashion possible. Unlike a street criminal, it
even followed its victims around and forced them to pay for their own
victimization. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody><i>Not that some of those tax dollars
haven't ever found its way in my pocket for a murder or two,</i></span></span><span
class=postbody> thought <span class=SpellE>Dara</span> with grim amusement. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>But there was one name she cherished. It had been given to
her by a <span class=SpellE>krew</span> of ragged street kids, when she was a
homeless runaway, living on the streets: <span class=SpellE>Dara</span>. As
Kane put it, "She'll dare to do ANYTHING, man!" And it was true. Not that she
was one of those pathetic losers that had to meet any dare or feel defeated.
Oh, no. She chose her battles, dared to fight them, and did so with cleverness
as well as boldness. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Despite a few months she spent on the streets, she later
made it into Texas Women's University in Denton, Texas, with a gymnastic
scholarship where she studied computers, electronics, and business for four
years. She became an intern after two years, and the skills she'd learned while
hanging with a <span class=SpellE>krew</span> served her well with some hobbies
she developed as an intern. She hated <span class=SpellE>pervs</span> and
hypocrites and she loved screwing them over. She'd learned all about "respectable
businessmen" as a runaway. They'd screwed her, literally, when she was
vulnerable, and now it was their turn to be shafted. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>As an intern, she did favors for her hacker friends on
campus, including learning to hack buildings as well as computers. For the most
part, she gained information that hackers could use, and made a nice profit
from it. After a year of this, and learning some more useful tricks from her
hacker friends, she became a professional burglar specializing in corporate
espionage and other high-security break-ins, stealing research data, account
information, and similar materials on a contract basis. She did it because she
needed the money, but also for the great satisfaction she got in proving
herself correct on what idiots the people in authority were. They never
suspected the sweet, blonde intern had either the ability or the will to fuck
them over. They definitely did not know she was their karma. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She still wasn't sure how she was found out by the CIA. No
one else caught her, but she was recruited right after graduation. One of her
friends was either a head hunter that used her and then sold her name to the
Company, or maybe they had been watching him, and from him they found her. It
didn't matter. What it came down to was join or be prosecuted. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She did what she always did. She rolled with the punches
and survived. The CIA was more fucked up than she had ever imagined. The Top
Secret marker was saved for petty bureaucrats and their stupid games, while
serious threats to national security were allowed to wile themselves away in
some tray, hardly looked at. Luckily, the other groups out there played as many
head games as the CIA, and most of the discovered threats were nothing more
than training exercises for the day hostile groups and countries really did
make their move, assuming they ever did. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She had never been a "clandestine service operations
officer." She was just a deniable asset, codenamed Angelica (at least that was
better than Nikita and Jezebel, which belonged to two others like <span
class=GramE>herself</span>). She was drafted for the dirtiest jobs, for working
with the grimiest of managers. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She had been haunted by the fact that she was ultimately
expendable to these bureaucrats who cared nothing for her. And the hell of it
was the Company cared more about her than her own family did simply because of
what she could do for them. It was only a matter of time before <span
class=SpellE>Dara</span> would be betrayed, abandoned, or killed; there would
be no one to care enough to investigate or seek justice on her behalf. And the
Company knew it just as much as she did. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Her skills were improved in all areas, particularly in
burglary, fighting, smuggling, and assassination. She did jobs where she helped
run guns south and drugs north. Even the two-bit vice cops would sniff them out
but knew better than to prosecute them. The CIA could probably even get away
with blowing fucking missionaries out of the sky. They thought they were All <span
class=GramE>That</span>, but in truth, they were just lucky that the rest of
the world is just as fucked up as they themselves were. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Finally, making her own connections, she struck out on her
own. Damned if she'd let someone else get the benefit of her risks and hard
work, only to take the fall when that same smug superior fucked up, as he often
did. She had to mess around some to get back into the gun and drug circuits
other than through the CIA, but she'd learned well. She even married that slob
Muddy just to get hooked into the Texas Syndicate. Damn asshole was a convict
who drank too much and did too much meth when he could. But he was easy to
control until she tried getting rid of him. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>So of course she took the contract with the Chinese agent
for the X-5 Unit. Something like the X-5 Unit was far too dangerous to leave
inside a military base with its fucked up soldiers that were into drugs almost
as much as Muddy anyway. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Getting it had been a cakewalk, really. All it took was
sleeping with the right scientist on the project and getting him to brag in bed
to her. He had been as easy as her Chinese patron claimed he would be. To be on
the safe side, she drugged him, took pix of documents and passwords she found,
and downloaded his files for good measure. After that, she just waltzed right
in and took it. It was so easy, and it had all been her. She chose to leave
Muddy then and there and go solo. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Unfortunately, her disguise hadn't completely fooled the
cams, nor did the fake fingerprints on her plastic glove that left the prints
of the scientist she seduced (and got her into the safe holding the X-5 Unit).
After all, BATF Agent Fleming rode her ass shortly after she had scored the
unit. Of course, Muddy was after her, too. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Then, to her horror, she was finally caught. The
authorities didn't get her real name, and wouldn't until a full investigation
by the <span class=SpellE>DSI</span> or <span class=SpellE>NSA</span> on her
crafted identity as Dallas Grimes was carried out. Between laziness and budget
cuts, that was unlikely. She would've escaped on her own, too, but her
fingerprints--her REAL fingerprints--had alerted the CIA that she was in custody.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She had almost formulated her escape plan when she was
unexpectedly released into the custody of her CIA manager. He had told her the
BATF had reneged on their agreement not to prosecute, but the CIA had gotten
someone to convince the judge to put her in the minimum, instead of a maximum,
security prison in Virginia. And from there he had quietly gotten her out. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She avoided the Chinese agents now. She had a cordial
relation with a member of the Yakuza, who had contracted her to retrieve some
embarrassing documents once, and he told her some things about the Chinese that
made her even more wary of them and their agents. The Yakuza agent still
remained in contact with her, and was VERY interested in what she was working
on now. <i>I wonder what the Chinese agent would've said about the <span
class=GramE>Yakuza?</span></i> <span class=GramE>she</span> wondered, grimly
amused as she frequently was. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>But she wasn't sure what to do about the CIA. After she
had the predictable conflicts with them, she left on her own. <i>I could've
broken out of that pathetic prison myself</i>, she thought contemptuously. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>But she frowned, remembering the last time she talked to
Oscar Wilson (if that were his real name), the Staff Operations Officer from
the CIA that ultimately "managed" her. He had demanded the names of all her
contacts as repayment. She'd refused and left, with them showing signs of
pursuit. Whether they were having fun with her, faking her <span class=GramE>out,</span>
or just incredibly stupid wasn't a guess she was ready to make yet. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She was amazed at how quickly Wild Card, a former CIA
agent like herself, managed to make her a sweet, sweet deal promising profit
and revenge. Still... it was odd that Wild Card contacted her not long after
she ran. He must still have connections within the Agency. No big surprise
there. But they both cultivated their own private connections as much as they
possibly could. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>After that fight with Wilson, they told me to run, and
while I know how to vanish and become someone else, it took a long time to hide
the fear on my face or the hate in my eyes. Sometimes, the fear and hate slip,
too. Damn, I'm glad I don't do Ice Cold. I'm paranoid enough as it is</i>. She
smiled self-depreciatingly at herself, while congratulating herself for being
strong enough to survive without the crutch of drugs. That was the reason she
was out here and Muddy was still sitting in a maximum security prison. </span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>After taking a blessed shower and getting into clean
clothes, she went to the flat she rented for a young hacker of no small
ability. He was young, horny, and idealistic, and very much in awe of her. He
was a wonderful tool. She even enjoyed the sex she had with him sometimes. She
hoped she never would need to kill him. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Letting herself in, she noticed the flat was a mess as
usual. She stepped over books and pamphlets dealing with what he called 'geek
stuff' as well as conspiracies, anarchism, libertarianism, and even the
paranormal and flying saucers. "So how goes it?" she asked. He understood, of
course, that she was referring to his task of cracking the CIA d-base. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I'm in!" cried <span class=SpellE>UpSing</span>
excitedly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She smiled a bit, still amused by his nick. "Upgrade to
the Singularity" was his full name. The one he had chosen for himself. He was
trying to prepare himself for the life of an immortal <b>god</b> by using new
technologies. As if that wasn't hard enough, he was going to try to drag
everyone else into the Singularity with him, kicking and screaming. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Since he was only 20, she found his folly cute. Being a
young male, he was easy to wrap around her finger. He was hormonally-driven and
rebelliously idealistic. <span class=GramE>And a probable genius and definitely
a skilled hacker.</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>What made him perfect was that he realized he needed her
more than she needed him. She had gotten to him before the cops did, the first
time he tried cracking the CIA d-base, just before she ran herself. Since then,
he had gotten better and now she hoped he was good enough to hack the CIA
without getting caught at it. That she frequently fucked him and covered his
bills with money to spare cemented his loyalty to her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So have you corrupted my files, fingerprints, and
records?" She rolled her eyes when he bit his lip. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Not yet," he hurriedly explained. "But I am in. I'm
routing through a computer I've hacked into in Washington DC so if anyone
detects my intrusion, they won't be able to connect me to here." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>That was likely, but not guaranteed. She'd prefer to tap
into the grid from a more anonymous source, but given the time required, that
would be impractical without some more sophisticated equipment, which she was
not yet willing to invest in. Still, they had security that would likely tell
them if he <span class=GramE>were</span> being traced, and that's also why she
rented these kinds of flats for him. As much as he enjoyed this electronic <span
class=SpellE>B&amp;E</span>, he'd probably work for a lot less. What she had
grown bored with was still intensely exciting to him. Still, hacking the CIA,
so soon after hacking the BATF, was something to be proud of. She rewarded him
with a kiss and tasted Jolt cola and some kind of sugary cereal on his breath. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He smiled a minute, and then frowned as he said, "I did
see Wild Card's file. They claim he's still active." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Did you download his file?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Of course." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Good. I'll look at it later." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"What if he really is working for the CIA still?" he
sounded truly disturbed by the idea. "Maybe we're working for the CIA, too, and
don't even know it!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Dara</span></span><span class=postbody>
hated the thought. Could others be using her hate to control her, the same way
she and Wild Card used the ideals and ambitions of others to control them? It
was a disturbing thought. She fought against the instinctive paranoia rising up
in her again. "I'll take a serious look at this file you downloaded," she
promised him sincerely. "And you've earned a bonus for getting it." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>His eyes narrowed. "So you DON'T know!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Most people in my line of work don't know who we're
really working for," replied <span class=SpellE>Dara</span> casually. "Especially
those of us into small jobs like information, petty favors, and even throwaway
assassins." She shrugged. "You're an <span class=SpellE>anarchocapitalist</span>
and <span class=SpellE>transhumanist</span>. If I were to approach you for the
CIA, it would be as a libertarian <span class=SpellE>hacktivist</span> in
college, someone rebellious from the CATO Institute, sick of the talk with no
action, or even a militant member of the freedom movement that ended all my
conversations by saying '4/19.' If you were more leftist, I might even act as a
socialist or a communist." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"But you wouldn't show up as someone claiming to rescue me
from imprisonment and to help strike back at the pigs?" He seemed to have been
thinking hard about this since he found Wild Card's file. <span class=GramE>And
now wondered if she was using him for the CIA.</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Dara</span></span><span class=postbody>
gave him a steely gaze. "No," she finally said. "You anarchists and
libertarians are notorious pacifists. Many of you don't even realize just how
much truth there is to the saying that political power comes from the barrel of
a gun, or how violence is the basis of all government." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Not true," said <span class=SpellE>UpSing</span>, "we
realize it all too well!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Dara</span></span><span class=postbody>
shrugged. "Those who meet the violence with violence are criminals if they
lose, respectable governments if they win, or submissive sheep if they do what
they're told. The last don't even face much violence. They submit to the very
threat of it, often with the same dedication of someone suffering Stockholm
syndrome, identifying with the government that exploits them. You anarchists
fall in with the criminals or the sheep." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"But doesn't more violence lead to more violence?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Of course it does," she said sweetly. "And so does
submission and slavery," she added in a more steely voice. "You need to get
this, 'we are the world' crap out of your head. Each and every one of us is a
nation of one, even if we willingly submit to other nations of one. Whatever
bullshit ideals we may pay lip service to, we are still people who manipulate
the world around us--and violence is just one of those methods. Hell, you've
read Nietzsche. It's that 'will to power' thing. The 'will to power' exists in
everyone, even the sheep that brag about being sheep. On a societal scale that
leads to governments, or as you anarchists like to describe it, pirates. You,
as a hacker, should know this." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I'm just not an <span class=SpellE>anarchoterrorist</span>,"
he said, a little sullenly, "and I believe people should work together instead
of fighting over everything." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She laughed, genuinely amused. "No, you just put viruses
and worms in bank accounts which eat up the money of the rich, who simply
replace it with the money of the poor. You also cracked the IRS files and got
all kinds of personal information that you sold, didn't you?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yeah," he said, "so people could disguise themselves like
you and I do and hide!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Oh, you really don't know how that information is used?
How the information you sell is sometimes used to destroy those people's lives
by stealing their credit cards, bank accounts, government benefits, and the
like? You don't think you're harming anyone when that blue-collar home is
repossessed? Or when one of the sweet soccer moms suddenly finds <span
class=GramE>herself</span> arrested for what someone with the stolen
information you sold them has done? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"And what if the CIA traces your intrusion to that
computer you infected in DC? What do you think will happen to the poor, naive
owner? You really think this is somehow morally superior to the quick, painless
death I tend to inflict on the predators of society, whatever side of the law
they happen to be on?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He blinked hard at that, and his breathing increased.
Finally, he shook his head. "How can you stand it?" He sounded to be in genuine
pain. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She shrugged. "I accept the nature of the world, and my
own dark nature. I don't hide from my <span class=GramE>strengths,</span> I
embrace them, and use them to overcome those who would overcome me." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You're not an anarchist for real, are you?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She giggled. "You ever think I was?" He was cute enough
that she felt amused tolerance instead of exasperation. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Are you a nihilist then?" He looked kind of confused, but
still cute. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"<span class=GramE>That,</span> or I'm a Machiavellian,"
she said. "We see things as the anarchists do, only we don't try to change the
game--there's no point as the game is intrinsic to human nature, inevitable, and
can't be overcome--we just work at becoming the best players of all. We're
practical, not idealists." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Then why are you helping me?" asked <span class=SpellE>UpSing</span>.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"It just so happens with me that I have a grudge against
the same people you do. In fact, I have a grudge against them for reasons
rather like your own. But I harbor no illusions, or even desires, about making
the world a better place." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I call bullshit on that," he said. "You wouldn't be doing
all this if you didn't want to take the Oppressor down. And you're too
independent to want to simply take over. You wouldn't have the patience for
telling everyone else what to do." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She shrugged again, silently agreeing that she didn't care
about taking over. But she added, "I deal with all the others out there... the
anarchists and the fascists, the Christians and the Muslims and the
Objectivists, the libertarians and the communists... and I'm just different
from all of them. They believe in things so strongly. But me, I don't care
about saving humanity from itself or helping humanity reach the Singularity or
turning into glorious star beings or reaching the Age of Aquarius or Horus. I'm
not interested in wasting my time with your revolution that slips through your
fingers whenever you think you're doing it. I have only one reason, and it's
perhaps the easiest to understand." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Revenge." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yep." She smiled sincerely. She appreciated not having to
point out the obvious. "Making me disappear was <span class=GramE>Their</span>
biggest mistake. I'm invisible now. I leave no traces, no footprints and <span
class=GramE>They</span> can't see me coming." He could hear the capital 'T' in <span
class=GramE>Their</span> and They. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So what happens when you get everyone?" he asked <span
class=GramE>curious,</span> and a little sad for her. <span class=GramE>"Do you
get me, too?" <br>
<br>
"Nope.</span> Not unless you cross me." When he looked at her with some doubt,
she added, "You're a hacker whom I trust and whose skills I'll want to use
again, no matter what happens. I don't throw away people like you. I'll even do
a little to keep you from danger, as long as it doesn't compromise me or my
major plans." She gave herself a brownie point for saying she trusted him with
a straight face. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"But if I became a hindrance to your plans?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She smiled grimly at him. "It would be in your best
interests if you did not hinder me, or cause me to suspect you of working
against my interests." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He swallowed, decided to change the subject, and asked a
little hoarsely, "How do you know that you worked for the CIA at all to begin
with?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She shrugged. "My administrator knew the proper pass codes
to show he was acting under presidential orders, whatever that's worth." When
she saw him smile cynically, she smiled back just as cynically. "Yeah, I'm sure
you could get those codes, too. I might even commission you to do that for me
one day." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So you don't know. You're just as in the dark about who
you were really working for as I am when I do jobs for you." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You work for me and for the advancement of your own
interests," she stated. After a moment she added, "In the end, I don't really
know what organization claimed the allegiance of those calling <span
class=GramE>themselves</span> the CIA. It could've been the Illuminati for all
I know or care. But I know the individuals, the nations of <span class=GramE>one,
that</span> my nation of one has declared war against. And those nations of one
have declared war against proactive freethinkers like <span class=GramE>yourself</span>,
just as they are trying to destroy me or bring me back under their control, so
we are in a position to be allies. Don't screw it up." She began fluffing out
her hair with her fingers as she sat on his bed. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He blinked. "You want to destroy the federal government!
Not just someday, but... but yesterday! <span class=GramE>For real!"</span> He
just realized that she wasn't speaking theoretically. She was dead serious. <span
class=GramE>And seriously deadly.</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Dara</span></span><span class=postbody>
stopped fluffing her brown hair, tossed her head, and looked at him again. "So
what if I do? It brings an end to the careers of many of my enemies, and those
who hunt for me. It's in my best interests to see the federal government destroyed.
And as long as you continue to prove useful, I'll even help you survive the
chaos as the new order is born." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"And for the revolution? What then?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She shrugged again. "Maybe you can shape it to your own
anarchistic visions. Frankly, I don't care if you find a bunch of <span
class=SpellE>anarchosyndicalists</span>, like those that actually took
Barcelona for awhile during the Spanish Civil War, to replace the current
order, though you'd all be well-advised to read Sun Tzu's <i>The Art of War</i>
and Machiavelli's <i>The Prince</i> before you try making your anarchist order."
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>UpSing</span></span><span
class=postbody> sniffed, replying, "I'd rather base a society on Spooner, <span
class=SpellE>Mises</span>, Virginia <span class=SpellE>Postrel</span>, Robert
Anton Wilson, and Buckminster Fuller. And if you want a classical text, then
add <span class=SpellE>Etienna</span> de La <span class=SpellE>Boetie's</span> <i>Discourse
de la Servitude <span class=SpellE>Volontaire</span></i>." Of course he would
give the French for <i>Discourse of Voluntary Servitude</i>, a radical text
with profound insights that influenced many later anarchist thinkers on both
the left and the right. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Dara</span></span><span class=postbody>
laughed lightly and added, "Well, when you'd rather win, try my reading list."
She went back to fluffing her hair nervously as she changed the subject. "I've
got a new car I'd like you to file for me, too." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"All too easy," he replied nonchalantly, drawing another
smile from <span class=SpellE>Dara</span>. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She got up and rewarded him with another kiss, this one
more lingering. She had to admit that for a young, idealistic computer hacker,
he really was cute. Given his ability and willingness to learn, he was a
pleasure to bed, too. </span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>A little later, from a pay phone, she dialed in a free
phone call to Agent Fleming's personal cell phone. (She had to love <span
class=SpellE>UpSing's</span> <span class=SpellE>sneakies</span> that fooled the
phone into thinking she paid.) She had the voice modulator on, as usual for
these calls. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Fleming," said the gruff voice she had come to despise. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Fleming," her electronic and sexless voice intoned. That
always got his attention. She hadn't led him wrong yet. <span class=GramE>Yet.</span>
"Have you heard of the shooting outside the Morgendorffer residence?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yes. We're thinking of arresting Daria Morgendorffer and
interrogating her, but we haven't decided." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Not a good idea, if you want to catch Dallas Grimes." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Why is that?" asked Agent Fleming suspiciously. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>"Because Ms. Grimes is supposed to watch
Daria.</span></span><span class=postbody> Take Daria away and you remove her reason
for being in Lawndale." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"She's still there?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You have to ask? Daria is too important. Dallas can't
leave. She's just run to ground, waiting for the cops to think she's out of
state. She's ditched the Corvette and gotten a 1996 Ferrari." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Why are you doing this?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Again? I told you, she is competition. I need her
removed. <span class=GramE>Permanently, if you can manage it.</span> Time's
almost up." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"At least we have one thing in common," gritted out
Fleming. "You keep in touch and give me any information in finding her, and I'll
personally see to it that she never bothers society again... or you," he added.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Understood," replied <span class=SpellE>Dara</span>, a.k.a.
Dallas Grimes, hanging up. <i>Falling into my web so beautifully, you
self-righteous prick!</i> <span class=GramE>she</span> thought to herself,
leaving the phone booth. Some days, it was good to be alive. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Thanks to <span class=SpellE>UpSing</span>, she had known
the BATF was sending in operatives on Saturday, and she'd planned to make her
presence known then. She'd even taken the trouble to get the blonde wig and
Corvette so she could be recognized by Fleming. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>In addition, Wild Card owned some of the Lawndale PD,
although not all of them. Those that belonged to him had instructions to leave
her alone. Apparently, the cops that had interfered with her that day weren't
under Wild Card's supervision. <span class=GramE>Too bad.</span> <span
class=GramE>For them.</span> But her shooting them definitely helped underscore
her presence to BATF Agent Fleming, which was all to her liking. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The fact that the operatives were those despicable boys
Muddy had sent after her from Highland and she first met in Los Vegas was just
extra chocolate on the cake. She'd enjoyed beating the crap out them.
Regrettably, she had to leave them alive to identify her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>And it's a very small prelude to what I'm going to do
to you, Agent Fleming,</i> she thought with vicious satisfaction. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Driving away, she made what preparations she needed to get
herself back to Lawndale. She turned on the tape and <span class=SpellE>Queensryche</span>
filled her new car again. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>They've given me a mission </i></span><i><br>

<br>
<span class=postbody>Her parents, particularly her nasty grandfather and uncle,
many of her teachers and coaches, the preachers of the damned Bible Belt, the
police that worked with pimps and other criminal figures for an exchange of
favors and profits, the administrators, the CEOs and managers--all very guilty. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Like Agent Fleming. She wondered if he had any kids, and
if he molested them. <i>Probably</i>, she thought. <i>The authoritarian fucks
are usually the most perverted of all and love <span class=GramE>lording</span>
it over everyone else</i>. As her hatred flared up, she again swore that she
would have her revenge. No one owned her anymore, and anyone who thought
otherwise had better be ready to die. Those who had caused her particular harm
were obscenities that she could only wash away with their own blood. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Thanks to the fucked up circumstances that fucked up Daria
Morgendorffer's life, Daria now became the key to that vengeance against the
one known as Fleming. <i>It's End Game for you and me, Agent Fleming, and you're
too much of a clueless idiot to know it! And then... onwards to D.C.!</i> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She sang along with the tape playing in her new 1995
Toyota Supra Turbo with real passion, even if that passion was born of hatred
instead of ideals like all the fools she and Wild Card planned to play for
their own advancement: </span><br>

<span class=postbody>------------------------------------------- </span><br>
<span class=postbody>03/28/01 WEDNESDAY 6:00 P.M. </span><br>
<span class=postbody>--------------------------------------------- </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria liked the logo of the <span class=SpellE>AWSDA</span>:
The fisted rose. Why was that chosen? Because the rose was beautiful and
durable and prickly, and the woman's fist around it was one that could endure
it, give it to someone, or hold on to it. There was an odd poetry she
appreciated about that. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span>, a "<span
class=SpellE>sifu</span>" of Wing Chun, was a part of the <span class=SpellE>AWSDA</span>--The
American Women Self-Defense Association. The woman who ran the <span
class=SpellE>WSD</span> class had referred Helen to <span class=SpellE>AWSDA</span>
when Quinn had begged for more training. The class included men and women of
all ages. This time, there were a few boys and girls obviously younger than
Daria and Quinn. Two of them seemed more proficient than many of the adults. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria still didn't know what to think of this. At least
her mom looked more ridiculous than she felt, but Quinn was already starting to
look as if she were getting the hang of it, even though she was obviously a
beginner. At least most everyone wore street clothes and not some uniform that
they made you buy. Three walls had large mirrors on them, similar to a ballet
class. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria saw Helen was measuring all the faces around her as
she struggled to keep up with everyone else. Quinn's heavily bruised face was
drawing many sympathetic glances. <i>No doubt she hopes she can get some of
these people on the jury</i>, thought Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Wing Chun seemed to start off with how to step up and how
to pivot on your heels and move your hips. Most of the others around her were
doing their sets fairly slow. They were to practice until their bodies could
make the moves naturally and easily. It sounded like endless repetitions, sets,
and drills. Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span> claimed there was more to it
than that, and it did seem more informal than she had expected, but so far it
was all repetition for the beginners as they were led through the motions over
and over again. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The <span class=SpellE>sifu</span> working with their
group was a man barely taller than Daria and of slight build. He had undeniable
grace and firmness and he talked as he led them through the basic moves. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Turning is very simple, but it is the most important
thing in the system. You must learn to turn naturally if you are to learn Wing
Chun. We use turning as a basic movement, or use it to move forward or
backward, but we do not go straight forward or backward." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Earlier, they had seen some demonstrations that were as
impressive as they were fast, involving lightning reflexes and simple,
graceful, yet brutal, counterstrikes. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria liked how some of it was explained in no-nonsense
terms. Like why did they prefer a vertical to a horizontal fist? Because the
trained vertical first had 100% better forearm pinning ability, while the horizontal
fist that she, Quinn, and her mom had learned in <span class=SpellE>WSD</span>
class only had about 10% more stopping power than an untrained vertical fist.
Wing Chun also taught how to put the most power into any punches you made,
something of real value to those with a build as slight as herself and Quinn. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>With three empty hand forms covering the basics of this
art (at least if she understood this correctly), it struck Daria as being much
easier to learn than she expected. Of course, she knew there was more to it
than just the basics. She saw more advanced students using kicks, too. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Wing Chun also used long poles, spears, and butterfly
knives, once the basic moves had been mastered. Training consisted of forms, a
wooden dummy with several sticks that taught the body to respond to the
counters of kicks and punches, sand bag training and finally freestyle
sparring. She heard them talking about "sticking hands," but she wasn't sure
what that was yet. Right now, she was content to wait on asking. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>All in all, Wing Chun seemed to be an art form based on
well thought out sequences of body mechanics and leverage. She also came to see
how the triangle positions she had learned in the <span class=SpellE>WSD</span>
Class had been developed. By using these positions and movements, strikes were
not dependent on power and strength, but by redirecting (even stealing) the
force and strength of the attacker. This seemed underscored by the necessity of
three people working together, the <span class=SpellE>Sifu</span>, the student,
and a partner, to learn Wing Chun. And their motto, "See it, practice it, <span
class=GramE>feel</span> it." <span class=GramE>A trinity.</span> <span
class=GramE>A living poem.</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The movements the beginners like her were using looked
silly. <i>Maybe if done faster, and while wearing brass knuckles,</i> she
thought, <i>we'd look more respectable. <span class=GramE>Especially with
spikes.</span></i> There were plenty of obvious beginners in the class. Many of
them didn't seem to be strong. Some looked outright overweight, underweight
and/or generally unhealthy. Yet some of the underweight ones seemed to have a
strength that belied their appearance, and the stocky ones moved with a grace
that belied their weight. Some were obviously more advanced, and moved with the
grace and balance of a dancer. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Their <span class=SpellE>sifu</span> continued with, "You
must learn to train your vision, so that you can see with both primary and
peripheral vision. The fighting vision must act as one whole vision. A whole
vision viewer can see all the areas on and around the opponent. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>"When countering an opponent, never look
at or into your blocking hand.</span></span><span class=postbody> Instead look
over your strike, and you will see your blocking hand as well as all of your
opponent's limbs. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Conserve your breath by deep breathing with your
diaphragm. Breath is always lost no matter how well your body is conditioned.
Conserve by being efficient and effective in combat. In combat, always breathe
slightly deeper with your diaphragm. Develop your focus and breathe in each
sparring session." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The moves they were practicing now were still simple, but
a little more complex. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Multiple moves will require slightly longer discharges of
breath. In desperate combat, there is no way to have smooth and rhythmic
breathing or movements. Do not waste your breath or your moves, but if you make
a mistake, press forward for it is all good if you prevail in the end. Blow out
your air when you counter. Use a single block if you can, but no more than two.
The third MUST be a strike." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>He seems to know what he's talking about</i>, thought
Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"When learning any reflex skill, you must train yourself
to be attentive without trying to predict what your opponent will do. Tell
yourself that you do not care which hand or leg will attack. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The untrained mind and body will always wonder, become
hypnotized, or make a gambling assertion as to which limb will attack during
combat. Without proper reflex skills, a person will have to work twice as hard
and will take twice as long to perform an action that is too late. This is
called being double weighted." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria noticed that despite the simplicity of the moves,
she was getting tired. Her muscles were just starting to ache. She noticed her
mom was actually sweating and looking nervous. Quinn seemed wholly into this.
Maybe she was a natural. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"During application drills," the <span class=SpellE>sifu</span>
continued, "learn to wait for the strike to get close to your body before you
move to counter. Do not move to counter an attack too early. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Train your body to receive fist and leg strikes at
moderate levels of impact. Train your mind to tolerate fear and train your body
to tolerate contact. There is no need to go into shock at minor injuries.
Continuous exposure to progressive strikes and attacks with increasing speed
and intensity will refine your skill. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Learn to put aside fairness and kindness to those who
mean you harm and develop intensity and ferocity. This will grant you the
courage and the fighting spirit needed to survive. But do not confuse this
trained and refined courage with the chaos and disharmony of rage and casual
violence." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria couldn't help but sigh in relief when Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Ribner</span> clapped her hands three times and everyone stopped
doing their exercises. She saw her mom go to one of the chairs by one of the
mirrored walls and collapse into it. She looked as if she might be in a little
pain and she definitely appeared exhausted. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"What did you think?" asked Quinn, bringing Daria's attention
back to where she was. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I don't know yet," said Daria. "I'm sure it will be
useful somewhere. Now if they could just get the Yoda stuff out of it, I think
they'd have a real good system." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria and Quinn turned as Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span>
joined them. "I don't think Wing Chun has any 'Yoda stuff' in it," she said
approaching. "There are concepts within it that may strike people as
unnecessarily spiritual, but they are truths understandable to the
practitioner. If you want pure fighting force, you might try <span
class=SpellE>Krav</span> <span class=SpellE>Maga</span> instead, but I don't
think it provides as much for the student as Wing Chun or many other systems." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"<span class=SpellE>Krav</span> <span class=SpellE>Maga</span>?"
asked Quinn, genuinely curious. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"<span class=SpellE>Krav</span> <span class=SpellE>Maga</span>,"
said Ms. <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Ribner</span></span><span
class=GramE>,</span> "is the Israeli defense system known as 'Contact Combat'.
It's an instinctive system designed to be quickly learned by men or women. It
develops rapid responses, quickly executed defenses, fighting spirit, and the
ability to apply techniques under stress. It's physically demanding and
intensive." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Sounds great," said Quinn sincerely. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"If that's for you," said Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span>.
"But Wing Chun offers many insights about yourself and the world around you
while you train. While it may take longer to learn enough to use as
self-defense, it's also a simple system that can be easily learned by men and
women both." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn blinked. "That's great," she said after a moment. "I
wanted to go ask someone I saw something. Is that okay?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span> smiled sardonically. "Sure.
Just don't offend people around here." Her tone was joking. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>After Quinn left to talk to several of the ones she'd seen
looking at her, Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span> turned back to Daria who
calmly gazed at her. "You're a deep one, I can tell," she said to Daria. When
Daria just stared at her blankly, she added, "Your face is still and unreadable,
and yet I can see that brain of yours working behind you eyes." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria sighed. "We came here hoping to learn to defend
ourselves. And a lot of this stuff is good, but--" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"It will take time?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yeah," Daria replied. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yes, Wing Chun is an easy system to learn, the harder
part being that process of unlearning what you had learned before." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria blinked at that. "And another thing is I don't trust
mysticism or psychobabble. In my experience, most people who relied on one or
the other were usually screwed-up. Or looking to screw someone out of
everything they have." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I'm not trying to screw you over, Daria," said Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Ribner</span> plainly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria tightened her lips as she wondered how Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Ribner</span> learned her name so easily. "You know me from the
news, don't you?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yes," she said. "Sounds like a tough situation you and
your family are in. But after watching you and your mother and sister today, I
think you'll come out of this okay." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I wish I shared your confidence," said Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Learn what you can, Daria. Wing Chun will not only teach
you how to defend yourself, but will give you insights into yourself and the
world around you. You'll grow as a person, and others will recognize it even
before you do." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Would Matthew?" asked Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span> paused before asking,
"The boy who first started shooting at your school, right?" When Daria nodded,
she added, "Yes. I don't know how much that would've changed things, but the
interactions between you would've been different. Your learning Wing Chun would
have taught you social moves that might have defused or otherwise handled the
situation without anyone getting hurt." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria's lips tightened. She was getting really sick of
people telling her how evil she was. She could tell herself that, without the
rest of the world jumping in. "I didn't use any eastern mysticism or martial
arts, and if I had, I don't think it would've worked. I used a gun instead." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You used what you knew," said Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span>
casually. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"If I had tried your way," added Daria, "my sister and I
would be dead." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span> paused, sensing the
defensiveness in Daria. "I do not think you are a bad person for using a gun,
Daria. Please don't misunderstand me. I'm not a priest who says you are going
to hell for not having faith or for not being a fatalist and accepting whatever
some callous deity or fickle fate and chance sends you. You did the best you
could in the circumstance you were given. You are remarkably aware, and yet you
still lack harmony. That's okay. Most people learn to walk, talk, think, and
act haphazardly from birth. What martial arts can do is teach awareness of the
mind and body that bring you into harmony within <span class=GramE>yourself</span>
and the greater world around you. Harmony is something we learn. And I like
your sister. I'm glad she's still alive. Thank you for saving her." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"It just seems," said Daria, "that he had a gun, and I
didn't know what else to do." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span> nodded
sympathetically, catching the guilt and sadness and loneliness barely cracking
in her voice. Most listeners wouldn't catch it, but Wing Chun had taught her to
really hear. "I understand. I'm not against your having a gun. Just remember
that people facing someone with a gun respect the gun, not the person. If the
gun can be taken away, so can the respect. Martial <span class=GramE>arts is</span>
something inherent and can't be taken away. A gun is a tool, and sometimes it's
the best you can do. But while a gun can take down a martial artist, the
martial artist will learn lessons that will help prevent such situations in the
first place, and when she can't avoid them, it's not something that can be
taken away from her. And she's less likely to lose her gun to an attacker, too,
as well as less likely to need one in the first place." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Cool," said Daria. "It's just the Yoda stuff just doesn't
hold up to me. Too many people, including me, see passivity and yielding as a
sign of weakness. I heard that in the women's self defense class. Some muggers
will ask for change and the woman who stops to help is considered weak and
therefore attacked." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span> shook her head. "It's
not the same thing, Daria. Yielding is not fatalism, it's not surrender, and it's
not giving up." She clasped her hands in front of her for a moment as she
added, "When I was your position, I was told that the concepts I'm after don't
translate into English very well. And even in the languages that are better
suited for explaining this, it is still something one must experience before
you understand it. Like sex." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I'm not so sure sex is all that it's said to be, either,"
said Daria wryly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Sex, like other aspects of life and interaction, is often
gone about wrongly, and so isn't the experience many are searching for. But you
noticed the people in my class. You saw the students defeating skilled
attackers, even if only in exercise. They did it by yielding at the right time.
But they didn't give up, or even just get out of the way. <span class=GramE>" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So you have no problem with FIST?" Daria was thinking of
the book she got from <span class=SpellE>WSD</span> Class. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Feminists <span class=GramE>In</span> Self-Defense
Training? <span class=GramE>Of course not.</span> For introducing women to
self-defense, it's a wonderful beginning." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I didn't find it very helpful--" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Why not?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Mostly it was telling me stuff that wasn't very useful,
like beware of all men." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Reading the rest of the book helps to put it in perspective,"
said Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span>, a bit of amusement in her voice. "And
FIST styles are martial, but they're also an art; they're something you come to
learn intuitively, which can sometimes provide the best form of thinking and
strategizing of all." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria snorted and definitely frowned. "That's why I don't
like mysticism and intuition and all that. Every cult leader and advocate of
tyranny would agree with that statement. With the Inquisitors it was 'deeper
indwelling of the Holy Spirit' that replaced reason and <span class=GramE>rationality,</span>
with the Nazis it was 'the voice of the Aryan blood and the voice of the
Fuhrer,' with the Communists it was the Dialectic. Everyone out to hurt others
denies reason first and says there is something better that can't be explained,
but must be trusted and obeyed." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>After blinking at this litany several times, Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Ribner</span> laughed. "You are remarkably aware, but that is not
what I meant at all!" She <span class=GramE>chuckled</span> a bit more before
adding, "This is not about surrendering your awareness to another, or allowing
another to attempt to impose harmony on you from without." She shook her head. "It's
rather the opposite. Martial <span class=GramE>arts teaches</span>
attentiveness to every little thing, from your thoughts to your actions. When
untrained, whether you act as your habits dictate or consciously choose to act
in a random fashion, you are reacting to details you haven't become aware of. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Martial <span class=GramE>arts teaches</span> you to pay
attention to those details. Through the exercises, you will become aware of
your own tensions, resistance, impulsiveness, and all that arises from the
societal programming and life experiences. As you become aware of them, you can
learn to adjust and correct them, which brings you into harmony. Someone who
demands you simply obey them because they 'know what's best' is conning you.
The only true teachers and guides are those who lead by example, not by word of
mouth that requires blind faith because you can't see it in action." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So we come, we see, and we believe what we're told?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Not at all. The styles teach awareness of the relation of
the mind and body, attention to detail, to the person with other people. With
practice, the student learns to send messages to the body that result in the
fluidity of movement that you've seen here today. You come, you see, and you
experience for yourself." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So how do these exercises help the mind?" asked Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"By working with the body, we can develop our minds. There
is no gap between mind and body; they are one." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I can see that there's some truth to that. But I didn't
experience anything greater than that today." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The exercises that are repeated over and over not only
strengthen the body but also teach the awareness that leads to harmony between
mind and body. You are essentially repeating your first lessons at carrying
yourself in the world from when you are a toddler, but this time you learn
better ways to be aware and how to act and when to not-act. And it takes just
as long to learn the basics." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Upgrade," said Daria neutrally. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"That's one way to look at it," she replied. "It's a
better way to use your power. Most important is to try to create power from our
mind, not from our muscles. That means we control our muscles, not the other
way around. That requires awareness. With awareness, comes harmony." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Fine," said Daria, "it helps you, but I don't see why you
have to get all mystical about it." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"As you become more harmonious," Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span>
replied, "all that you do becomes more harmonious, more aware. By doing this,
you not only eliminate the disharmony from yourself, you influence and inspire
those around you by your change and growth to follow your example. This leads
to social harmony, and helps eliminate the kinds of unfortunate situations that
started this." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You mean," said Daria crossing her arms, "that learning
martial arts not only improves the student, but the world around the student?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Wars, domestic and child abuse, even poverty and disease
come from a lack of collective harmony. By learning harmony and inspiring it in
others, the world around you is improved." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Are you now, or have you ever been, a Communist?" There
was only a trace of the amused cynicism for anyone to hear in her voice. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No," she smiled, with a touch of amused cynicism of her
own, "the Communists attempt to overcome the collective disharmony of
capitalism with another form of collective disharmony." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Which ideology has your experiences taught you to be the
correct one?" The sarcasm was only evident as she said "experiences." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span> cocked her head a bit
as she answered. "That's hard to answer, Daria. All I can say is harmony. Maybe
'No Way' is the way." She shrugged. "Look to Taoism for more." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I heard Taoism was used by some anarchists." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"This is believable. However, many <span class=SpellE>sifus</span>
discourage political activism of any kind, believing it to represent egotism at
best, and inspiring violence at worse. <span class=GramE>Those who fight
aggressively against the 'authorities' are often suffering from their own lack
of harmony, and if they succeed in overthrowing the current system, they merely
replace it with a new form of disharmony.</span> That's not to say an anarchist
or political revolutionary can't act with harmony and defy the existing rulers;
nor is it to say that a king or politician can't act with the same harmony. It
would be a better world if more acted with harmony, whatever their overall
ideology and leanings. In a harmonious world, government could possibly become
irrelevant so that anarchism also becomes irrelevant." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The imposition of order leads to the escalation of
disorder, and vice versa." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span> blinked. "You're
familiar with the Tao?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria shrugged. "No, Robert Anton Wilson." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Cocking her head, she asked her, "Have you heard the
Taoist teaching, 'it may be good, it may be bad'?" After Daria shook her head,
she continued, "A farmer lost his horse and his neighbor expressed sympathy for
his loss. He said, 'It may be good, it may be bad.' Later, the horse returned,
leading other horses. His neighbor congratulated him on his good fortune. He
said, 'It may be good, it may be bad.' The next day, the farmer's son tried
riding one of the new horses but was thrown and broke his arm. When his
neighbor sympathized, he replied, 'It may be good, it may be bad.' The
following day the king's men came through their village, looking for conscripts
to fight in the king's war. Because the son was healing from a broken arm, he
was deemed useless and left behind." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She gave a moment for Daria to digest this. "Do you
understand the moral of this story?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria shrugged. "You're saying that all that has happened
may be good and it may be bad?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I'm saying," she replied, "that there is good and bad in
everything that happens to us. Rather than looking for absolutes, look to what
good there is and what good can come from it, even from what happened to you
and your family. What we do with our fate is left to us and our attitude. We
can do so much more when we become aware of these little nuances and achieve
harmony with them. Mind, body, and awareness." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So maybe with Matthew dead, he won't kill an entire
family elsewhere?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Maybe," she said neutrally, "or maybe you and your sister
will come to learn greater harmony through this and pass this harmony on to
others. Then there will be less violence overall. This is why the sages cultivate
the 'wait and see' attitude." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I don't get that part," said Daria, "he might have
destroyed my sister's life. He failed to kill her, his friend didn't manage it
either, but my life is ruined. By the time this is all over with, I'll probably
be as much of a sociopath as he was." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I doubt it," said Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span>. "Bitter,
maybe, or even an outlaw and revolutionary in the most extreme of cases, but
not a sociopath. And if you learn minimal muscular effort that relies on the
harmonious movements to be successful in resolving conflicts, it will cause you
to question all you have learned about strength and power. You may even grow
serene." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Serene?" asked Daria in disbelief. "I'm not the mystical
type. I just don't see myself as serene." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You're young, and you don't know that yet. As with any
art, Wing Chun also encourages self-exploration and expression which translates
the new lessons of harmony and new insights about strength and power into
relationships. The external exercises aid the internal look and the exercises
with partners and opponents provide a mirror in which to see yourself, and how
your actions affect the other. And things just might not turn out so bad after
all." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So?" asked Daria. She wasn't sure if the <span
class=SpellE>sifu</span> was making sense or spouting word salad. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So," added Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span>, "the
guilt you're carrying is a burden that does not help you or anyone else. I'm
not promoting moral relativism or defending sociopaths, either. I'm saying you're
carrying so much guilt and grief inside and it's destroying you. You're looking
to punish yourself even more than you look to punish others around you. Daria,
I'm measuring you, and I like what I see. I'm not your enemy, and I wish you
weren't your own enemy." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria blinked at that, fighting to maintain a grip on her
feelings. Part of her wanted to yell at this bitch for going all Timothy O'Neill
on her. Part of her wanted to collapse into sobs on her shoulder. But mostly,
she was stunned, looking back at how she tended to attack those she needed for
allies, and how she attacked herself when not attacking them. She was amazed
that Quinn had stuck by her, and felt relief that she hadn't been as harsh on
Quinn as she almost had been more than once. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You okay?" asked Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span>. "Do
you need a moment?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria shook her head. "No. I'm fine." She glared a moment
at Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span>, daring her to comment further. When no
further comments came, Daria asked, "So how's this training the body suppose to
help me explore myself and reach enlightenment anyway? I just don't get that
part." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span> paused a moment
considering before she answered, "As you outgrow your old concepts of strength
and power--or upgrade, as you called it--you begin to look at new ways in other
areas of your life as well. If you learn harmonious actions and minimal
violence, your words, actions, and other forms of self-expression will follow
suit." She smiled a bit. "And most of the time, other people will see the
change in you before you see it in yourself. Many people want to see that
change in themselves." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"<span class=SpellE>Hmph</span>," said Daria, "I'd figured
most people learn martial arts because they just don't want to get beat up.
Especially by others who have learned it." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"There is that, and we accept that reason. Martial arts
are a means of defense. But the world would be a much better place if most
people who dabble in martial arts didn't just learn enough to win a few fights
but made martial arts an ongoing learning experience to the day they die. They'd
be healthier mentally and physically, too." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So how does this help <span class=SpellE>AWSDA</span>
then?" asked Daria. <span class=GramE>"To teach women to use violence less?"</span>
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She shrugged. <span class=GramE>"Maybe.</span> It's more
accurate to say it teaches when to give and when to push, and just how,
exactly, one gives or pushes. Giving isn't defeat, either. It's a strategy like
anything else." When Daria just stared at her, she added, "Have you heard of
the Bodyguard's contributions to women's emancipation?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria shook her head. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"They were a group of women who snuck away from their
homes to learn jujutsu. Two sisters in a prominent British family even climbed
down the drainpipes of their house to learn this art. The women campaigning for
women's suffrage suffered a lot of abuse, including whippings and beatings by
police officers. The Bodyguard protected the workers from thugs on either side
of the law. Sometimes they met violent cops head on and defeated them, but they
also knew when to fall back and flow around those who stalked them as well as
when to press forward. Those who attacked them usually had no idea when to do
which, and so frequently failed in their efforts." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So is it about teaching how to use violence
strategically, or how to avoid violence?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span> took a moment to
collect her thoughts. "Everything you learn will dissuade attackers. Your genuine
confidence, your balanced walk, your awareness are all means to avoid criminal
assault, and sometimes even legal assault. By your increased awareness of
yourself and your world you will not lose control so easily that you feel a
need to resort to desperate measures. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Likewise, your stance is more likely to inspire respect
instead of envy and bitterness, and if others turn poisonous against you, you
will know how to deal with it. You will learn better ways to resolve
situations, but when you are attacked--or even when you must attack, though this
should be rare if it happens at all--then you will be prepared for it. Being
prepared is often enough to prevent the need for a cure in the first place." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So you teach the soft instead of the hard martial arts?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Soft and hard categories are more acceptable in the West
than in the East. The East tries to avoid categorizing as one thing or another.
Wing Chun is especially resistant to being categorized as soft or hard. It's
not about whether a style is 'hard' or 'soft' but about balance and harmony
between them. By learning this harmony within yourself, you also learn to
achieve this balance with the people and the world around you." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>When Daria stared at her quizzically, trying to
understand, she added, "Water is like this. It can softly flow around you, and
it can hit you with a force capable of crushing and killing you. It is neither
hard nor soft but both. This is the ideal of martial arts." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Maybe," said Daria, beginning to shut down. She was
finding this talk as emotionally exhausting as the exercises had been
physically tiring. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Daria," said Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span>, "our
experiences define our perceptions and then our perceptions define our
experiences. The trick in life is to keep our perceptions from becoming so ingrained
that we fail to see other sides of the story, and other possibilities that
exist around us." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yes, Master Yoda." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I'm sure you see all those people on the news," continued
Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span>, ignoring Daria's sarcasm. "Their
perception of right and wrong pigeonholes their perceptions about everyone else
according to their own experiences, and they fall prey to egotistical
righteousness and the belief in the supremacy of their views, as if no other
perception was as right as their own. Which is not only false for <span
class=GramE>themselves--</span>at best, they're right only some of the time--but
is definitely wrong in regards to other people. Other people have had
completely different experiences, and thus have completely different
perceptions." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Who are we to say who's on the dark side of the force?"
asked Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"If people do not realize that we are evolutionary beings
who need to change constantly, they will ruin not only their own lives, but the
lives of those around them, such as <span class=GramE>yourself</span>.
Ultimately, if we can't learn to see beyond our own perceptions--and the
feelings of righteousness it inspires as we try imposing those perceptions on
everyone we can--it could even lead to the extinction of our species." When
Daria just stared at her, she smiled slightly as added, "Wars don't make one
great. But Wing Chun can help you can see inside yourself, and as a result, see
those around you more clearly." She smiled a little more as she saw Daria catch
the phrase Yoda used in <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>They both turned as Quinn rejoined them. She motioned for
them to continue. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"It seems everyone," said Daria, "from the NRA to Handgun
Control, wanted me to become their spokesperson and when I <span class=GramE>wouldn't,</span>
I was this evil villain out to destroy America. I learned to hate them all,
just as they came to hate me once I didn't dance to their tune. More than that,
it was like they all had someone close to them who <span class=SpellE>offed</span>
themselves, or shot them, or took their precious country away from them as if
it wasn't anyone else's country, too, and it's all my fault." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"They're scared, Daria," she said, "of change, of other
people, of themselves. Many of them are haunted by the same guilt you feel but
project it into the people around them where they can handle it. Taking
responsibility for our lives and actions, especially in the case of a suicide
of a loved one, is painful. Blame is easier and shifts the pain of taking
responsibility. They, like you, need to learn to see actions without blame.
When that happens, then you can all learn patience and to forgive others--and
yourself." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The NRA say I'm not American or patriotic enough, <span
class=SpellE>HCI</span> says I'm too sociopathic, and you think I'm not
enlightened or something." added Daria sullenly, and hating herself for the
bitterness in her voice but unable to stop it. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I do not blame you for anything in my life, Daria, and I
don't blame you for what you did. You did the best you could with what you had.
So does everyone else. Regrettably, this Matthew had less than you did--perhaps
not in intelligence, for I understand the boy was quite intelligent--but in
knowing his own heart, or having a family he could depend on. He was helpless
in a world that spit on him, and he learned how to shape the world in his own
way while gaining the respect he needed for his own validation. Now that the
world is spitting on you, I hope you can learn a better way to gain respect and
acceptance, or even learn to not need the validation of others." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Unnoticed by Daria, Quinn tensed, as she suddenly saw how
alike she and Matthew were. Different in many outward ways, but deep within,
they were so alike. She blinked as she felt tears of compassion for the man who
abused her and ultimately tried to murder her; she did not have to struggle to
keep from crying, but she felt her hate dissolving, giving way to pity. The
small part of her that was vindictive took some satisfaction in knowing that
Matthew, while alive anyway, would have preferred her hate and fear to the
sense of pity she now had for him. She swallowed and tried to rein in these
feelings until she was alone. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria shook her head. "If we're not to judge--" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Don't confuse judgment with awareness," interrupted Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Ribner</span>. "And I'm not telling you to become apathetic. It's
a two-way street. It's not where you forgive your enemies and offer them your
other cheek. You simply reserve moral judgments while being aware of how they
affect your inner and outer harmony and adjust yourself so you remain in
harmony--and reserve moral judgment on yourself for what you do, as well." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I don't know if I can do that." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"It's as hard as catching the wind at first. All that we
are is a result of habits. Nearly everything we do is the result of a habit, a
behavior we have learned for better or for worse. Even our thoughts are
habitual. They can all be changed with conscious effort in time. It will happen
gradually, and others usually notice even before you do. Some even find a day
dawns that they have achieved inner peace and contentment." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Um, whatever," said Quinn who was tired of waiting for a
good breaking-in point (not to mention having to deal with these unexpected
feelings). She drew a slight smile from Daria who mistook her need to interrupt
with simple (and refreshing) shallowness. "I notice a lot of people here have
good posture and stuff. Is this stuff used by models?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Oh, I'm not sure," Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span>
said hesitantly. "I don't think so, though good posture and health are
encouraged by these arts. If posture is your main concern, you might want to
look into Tai Chi. That's not too demanding and I understand many follow it for
posture and health." She shrugged. "But it usually takes longer to be able to
learn how to defend yourself from attack." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Is Wing Chun one of the popular forms of Kung Fu or
whatever?" asked Quinn. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Master Wang <span class=SpellE>Kiu</span> said that Wing
Chun is a jewel among the martial arts. There are other good martial arts but
among these Wing Chun stands out. It is simple, elegant, effective and
enjoyable to practice. And despite the simplicity, there is a multitude of
expressions that can take a lifetime to explore." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Art," said Daria, thinking of Jane. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn's bruised face crinkled in some thought before she
spoke again. "What if I were to become an actress of a sitcom or movie, what's
the most popular style?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span> blinked several times
at that. "It would depend, I guess. If you're more of an action heroine, then
something <span class=GramE>like</span> <span class=SpellE>Krav</span> <span
class=SpellE>Maga</span>. If you're more into martial arts movies, then Wing
Chun has a long tradition in the filming industry. Bruce Lee originally learned
Wing Chun before he formed his own style, <span class=SpellE>Jeet</span> <span
class=SpellE>Kune</span> Do, or the Way of the Intercepting Fist, and he's an
icon now." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Is Bruce Lee related to Jet Li? He's cute. So's that
other guy." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span> smiled. "You know, I
honestly don't keep up with that." She shrugged. "Try the internet, I'm sure it
will answer any questions you have regarding movie stars." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Like how many liposuctions or breast implants they've
had?" asked Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"<span class=SpellE>Ewww</span>," said Quinn, facing
Daria, "no one wants to know THAT! That's private stuff!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Do you know how Wing Chun came to be?" asked Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Ribner</span>. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria and Quinn shook their heads. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"A Buddhist nun living in the Ch'ing Dynasty named N Mew--spelled
N-g, M-u-i, so don't get confused if you want to read up on her--studied various
animal styles of Kung Fu--such as tiger and crane--and found them unsuitable to
her body type. So she paid attention to her body and formed her own. She made
her own style that fit her small stature and weak arms. Since she did not give
very effective strikes at the midsection of a larger man, she developed kicks
and punches to the head and lower legs, and she formed a new aggressive style
that won many matches against the male masters of the art, thus legitimizing
her style. She later taught this to a an orphan she had picked up, whom she
named <span class=SpellE>Yim</span> Wing Chun, which means 'beautiful
springtime' or 'hope for the future.' She passed all her skills and knowledge
on to her and she then passed it on to others. It remains popular to this day."
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"That's a nice story," said Quinn. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Ah, the feminist martial artist," commented Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Wing Chun is not about brute strength, but about correct
positioning, feeling, timing, and strategy. A woman your size, Daria, could
beat up a man over six feet tall and weighing over two-hundred pounds. Skill
more than makes up for size, and that was the original intent of the art." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So it's not for the men?" asked Quinn quizzically. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Many men practice and teach various styles of Wing Chun,"
she said. "But many women today do choose her style as it fits with women
easier, and to honor her accomplishments among the male masters of the art. And
as I said earlier, Bruce Lee was taught this art and he made it famous in the
West." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You said he made up his own style?" asked Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"<span class=SpellE>Jeet</span> <span class=SpellE>Kune</span>
<span class=GramE>Do</span>, the way of the intercepting fist," replied Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Ribner</span>. "Yes, he developed his own style. He didn't get to
pass on all he knew, but he did create his own style which is also very
popular, and an outgrowth of Wing Chun." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"An upgrade?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Another style," she corrected. "Martial <span
class=GramE>arts is</span> truly different strokes for different folks. What's
important is what works for you. Because we all have our physical and mental
differences, we all are better suited to a certain style than to others. I
think you would be better suited to Wing Chun, but you might find <span
class=SpellE>Jeet</span> <span class=SpellE>Kune</span> Do works better for
you." She shrugged. "Or another style altogether." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Like <span class=SpellE>Krav</span> <span class=SpellE>Maga</span>,"
said Daria. "Can you tell us more about that?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"It is used by police, soldiers, agents, terrorists, and
others. It makes me think of street fighting, personally. But for quickly
learning how to take an attacker down, even one with a gun shoved in your back,
it's hard to beat." She shook her head. "It has its points, but it's more
martial than it is art." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Well since we seem to have made some people pretty mad at
us, and I may be going to prison, maybe that's what I should look into," said
Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span> looked a little
distressed. "Yes, if you're in immanent danger. And don't forget to call AWARE,
too! They provide tremendous support for those being stalked." After a sigh,
she added, "Just remember that Wing Chun, and other styles, have a lot to offer
you, too. And when you go to learn a new system, empty your cup before pouring
in a new type of tea. You can make your own style that works best for you
later, once you have learned the foundations of the various arts and styles you
learn." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen, who noticed Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner's</span>
look of distress, joined them, wondering which of her daughters had just
distressed her. "Hi!" she said, still sweating a little. "This was a wonderful
class." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Thank you, Mrs. Morgendorffer," said Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Ribner</span>. "I'm just worried that the more martial benefits of
my class might not be timely enough for your daughters' needs." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Pardon me?" asked Helen, slightly confused. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Perhaps it's best if you all took some <span
class=SpellE>Krav</span> <span class=SpellE>Maga</span> classes," Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Ribner</span> replied, "at least for the immediate future. These
methods will help deal with <span class=GramE>stalkers,</span> and so can
AWARE." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Stalkers?" asked Helen. "Oh, I see. It's a bit unusual.
There is a possibility that some people who shouldn't be allowed to walk
freely, let alone have a gun, might come after my girls. It's not exactly the
same." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span> shook her head. "There
are many similarities. <span class=SpellE>Krav</span> <span class=SpellE>Maga</span>
can help. Wing Chun can, too, but it takes more time. I prefer Wing Chun
myself, but you're in an emergency situation. I can speak to a friend and get
you to visit a <span class=SpellE>Krav</span> <span class=SpellE>Maga</span>
class or two free of charge." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Thank you," said Helen, not sure what to say or think. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"<span class=SpellE>Krav</span> <span class=SpellE>Maga</span>
can also teach you how to deal with a gun, at least in close quarters,"
continued Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span>. "And do you own a gun?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"What?" replied Helen, almost stunned. "Of course not!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I think you should get one," said Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span>,
"at least until this situation gets cleared up. Again, contact AWARE, they will
help you find a gun suitable to you, teach you to use it, how to keep anyone
from getting it away from you, how to keep it from falling in the wrong hands,
and more. You can also look into A Mother's Arms. They're an excellent group
for a mother in need of having a gun to defend herself and her children." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"A Mother's Arms?" asked Helen mystified. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"It's a nonprofit group helping mothers to learn to use
guns in the face of serious threats, and to keep those guns, and any children
that stay in their home, safe." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen shook her head in amazement. "I never heard of such
a group. The very concept is strange to me." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The wrong people are after your daughters," said Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Ribner</span>, "and you say they have guns. If they use those guns
from a distance, it would be in your best interest to have your own gun. And
the very presence of a gun has often been enough to discourage an attack in the
first place." She shook her head. "If it's not enough, then you definitely should
get your own gun, before any one of these people <span class=GramE>bring</span>
their own guns. <span class=SpellE>AWSDA</span> can help with guns, too. You
might even want to look into signing up for a course at Thunder Ranch or
similar group." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I don't like the idea of solving a problem with a gun,"
said Helen hesitantly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I hope no one would," Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span>
replied, "or with any kind of violence. But as long as the wrong people are
armed, then the good people need to be armed, too, or the good people will live
at the mercy of the wrong people." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>After several moments Helen said, "I'll look into it." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span> looked concerned but
nodded her acceptance. "I can tell I gave you something to think about which
you haven't thought about before. It is, and should be, your decision. But
please contact AWARE and Mother's Arms and talk to one of the members. See what
they have to offer before you reject them. I'd hate for any harm to come to
your daughters that could otherwise be prevented." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen smiled nervously and said nothing. When Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Ribner</span> excused herself and left them, she let out a big
breath. "Quinn," she said, "<span class=GramE>did</span> you tell her to say
that?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No!" said Quinn, "she said it all on her own!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>When Daria saw Helen staring suspiciously at her, she
sighed and said, "I'm just as surprised as you are." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen sighed herself. "Come on, girls," she said, putting
an arm around each of her daughters and leading them out to the car.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=postbody>---------------------------------------------- </span><br>
<span class=postbody>04/02/01 MONDAY 7:45 A.M. </span><br>
<span class=postbody>------------------------------------------------ </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>GUN CONTROL IS A DISEASE - YOU ARE THE CURE </i></span><i><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>In March of 1996, a deranged man walked into a school in <span
class=SpellE>Dunblane</span>, Scotland, and killed sixteen children and one
teacher. In the aftermath of this heinous tragedy, British politicians sought
to reduce violent crime by enacting an injudicious ban on all handguns. Handgun
owners were given a February 1998 deadline to turn in their firearms--and they
did. The UK was supposed to become a much safer place--but it didn't. Not by a
long shot. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>As reported in a May 14 article in the Edmonton <b>Journal</b>,
England's recently released gun-crime statistics for the first five years
following the gun ban indicate a very different outcome than that which was
forecast. According to the article, "the incidence of gun crime in England and
Wales nearly doubled from 13,874 in 1998 to 19,070 in 2000. And the incidence
of firearms murder, while thankfully still very small, has risen 65 per cent," </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The article details statistics from another report issued
last year by Britain's Home Office, which reveal that there has also been a
dramatic increase in robberies in recent years. They report that robberies, "rose
by 24 per cent in 2000 alone and, since 1998, there has been an increase in the
annual average of muggings of more than 100,000. England alone has nearly
400,000 robberies each year, a rate nearly one-quarter higher per capita than
that of the United States." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Do gun bans serve to reduce violent crime? When
law-abiding citizens are disarmed, is their society a safer one? England's
plight is just the latest example to show us, yet again, that the answer is "NO."
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Unfortunately, the gun grabber's solution to the failures
of their gun control is more of it. What else would you expect from a liberal?
The country is insane, if you accept the definition of insanity as trying the
same thing over and over to see if it will work "this time." YOU are the cure.
Stand against the forces that want to turn all of America into Lawndale High,
where good, honest folk live only at the mercy of sociopaths. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The vultures are already swarming. Senators, congressmen,
councilmen pushing and shoving to be the first to climb on top of the dead
bodies to get a better photo op and shrieking for the same kind of laws that
left the dead defenseless in the first place. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>I urge you, as Virginia's next Senator, not to listen to
the lies of the gun control lobby. Listen instead to the facts. God bless. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mr. Win Alexander </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>PAID FOR BY THE NRA</span></i><span class=postbody> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria sighed and looked up, putting the <i>Lawndale
Gazette</i> down. Quinn was silently eating breakfast, and her mom on the phone
just gasped. She wondered what it was. Had her dad just defended himself with a
gun? <span class=GramE>Or maybe Aunt Amy?</span> This did seem to run in the
family. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You'll... <b>assume</b>?" Helen was taking deep breaths
now trying to calm <span class=GramE>herself</span>. After a moment, now
looking at Daria and Quinn who were both looking at her in concern, she asked, "Anything
else?" After a few more moments, she said, "Good bye," crisply and hung up.
Then, turning away, she dialed on the phone again. "Hi, Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span>,
this is Helen Morgendorffer. You said I should talk to AWARE and A Mother's
Arms, and now I agree. I want to talk to them ASAP, and if they handle
emergency cases, then I want them to know I am one. And I was wondering if you
could get me and my daughters into that other class you mentioned. <span
class=GramE>Soon.</span> My number here is..." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>As Helen gave off the number, Quinn asked Daria, "What was
that about?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria just shook her head. But she was really worried. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen hung up and slowly put the phone away. She took a
few deep breaths before turning around to find both of her daughters looking
fearful. She smiled to calm them, and their faces registered a little more
fear. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Mom?" asked Daria, "What's wrong?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"What makes you think anything is wrong?" asked Helen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn looked to Daria. "She's kidding, right?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Okay, fine," said Helen. "Quinn, you're not going to
school today, and you're confined to the house with Daria." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Mo-<span class=SpellE>oom</span>!" shouted Quinn, "I was
just asking!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen sighed loudly. "Yesterday, Scott Rhodes was released
on bail into his grandmother's custody. As of this morning he is missing.
Police are looking for him, but so far he remains missing." Helen almost cried
when she saw the look of terror on Quinn's face. She hated to say what was
next. "The boy's grandmother claims her .38 revolver is missing." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn shut her eyes and tried not to cry. Daria bit her
lip and was torn between rage and despair. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"He assures us," said Helen bitterly, "that we are under
constant police protection." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Rage won in Daria. She got up and stomped out. Part of her
wanted to comfort Quinn, but she feared her mom would say something that would
unlock the rage in her and she'd shriek at them all. And then go outside and do
the same to the pigs out there, with an assault thrown in for good measure. She
wondered if her Docs counted as a weapon. <i>Considering that someone who threw
a jelly donut at a cop was charged with assaulting an officer with a deadly
weapon, I would say so</i>, thought Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Talking to Jane on the phone calmed her enough that she
could sit down to write a Melody Powers story. One in which Melody blasted her
way first through Chinese secret agents, and then through corrupt cops and
vicious drug dealers controlled by sinister Chinese agents. Before she knew it,
hours had passed, and she felt surprisingly hungry. As if she'd been working
out rather than sitting in her room. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria went back down. Quinn wasn't there. She was probably
in her room. <span class=GramE>Maybe staring out her window.</span> Maybe she
should go talk to her. But she was curious <span class=GramE>whom</span> Mom
was on the phone with. She caught it was her defense attorney, Ms. Morrison.
Her eyes widened when she heard her mom say something about having Geraldo
Rivera arrested for criminal trespass! </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The radio was on and NPR was coming through. She frowned
and went to turn it off. It was interfering with her eavesdropping. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Daria, don't!" said Helen. "They're supposed to talk
about the case any minute now." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Oh," said Daria. Then she started to make herself a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich. As her mom turned her discussion onto more
arcane aspects of the case, she ended up hearing more NPR than her mom on the
phone. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Since the recession began at the end of February or the
beginning of March, women continue to lose jobs," said the feminine voice on the
radio. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"More, Bush's gag order, the restatement of President
Reagan's policy instituted in 1984 and overturned later by President Clinton,
cut off U.S. funds to any international family planning organization that
offers abortion counseling or services with their own privately-raised funds,
lobby the host government for liberalization of abortion laws, or provide
information about abortion." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The voice changed to that of a woman sounding at wit's
end. "Right now," said the grim voice, "Bush's global gag rule has led to the
closure of clinics, cuts in health care staffing, dwindling medical supplies.
This has caused countless women, children, and families to be without access to
vital health care services. Not only that, but millions of dollars have been cut
to several clinics and countries, and contraceptives are not getting to several
areas that desperately need them, leading to the spread of AIDS. Bush is
killing these people because he doesn't want women to have control over their
own bodies. He might as well be pointing a gun at these women and pulling the
trigger himself." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The former voice resumed "Bush has also cut services to
the military, just one of them being the availability of abortions at military
hospitals. As a result of current policy, women serving abroad must gain the
permission of their commanders to leave, and must use personal funds to travel
long distances to get away from dangerous areas such as the Middle East, to
places where they can find privatized services." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Music came on then and a bunch of announcements for
funding and future programming, as Helen put the phone down on the table and
sat down by a cup of tea. A male voice on the radio said, "Many of you are
familiar with the case of Daria Morgendorffer, who shot down a drug dealer in
her school of Lawndale High. Drugs, weapons stockpiling, and racist ideology
are obviously involved with both the shooter and the victim, the latter being a
shooter himself who shot his Asian principal and a fellow African American
student before turning on his girlfriend, Daria's younger sister. A little more
than a week later, Daria's younger sister would get in a shoot-out with another
drug dealer at the drug dealer's home. Since then, several disturbing new
factors have become apparent. NPR's Laurie McKenzie reports." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>A woman's voice filled the radio again. "I'm talking with
Mr. Hunt, the new lawyer overseeing the legal aspects of the case in Lawndale
for <span class=SpellE>HCI</span>, or Handgun Control Inc. Mr. Hunt, what is
the interest of your group in this case." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Well, I'd think that would be obvious," said Mr. Hunt. "Here
we have proof positive that there are too many guns lying around and children
are dying as a result." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Has the support for Daria from feminist organizations,
including the National Organization of Women, surprised you?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yes. I understand in hindsight. They see a girl that
stopped a horrible stalker. This is a good thing in itself. However, they
overlook the fact that, had the gun laws been stricter, Matthew Foster never
would've had a gun in the first place. For that matter, neither would Daria
Morgendorffer. The altercations never would've gone beyond assault, and he
probably wouldn't have done even that when he didn't have a gun to oppose the
police for his heinous acts. The National Organization of Women should see
this. Some do. But enough support remains that the organization itself is
keeping its distance while more radical feminist groups are even raising money
for the defense of Daria Morgendorffer." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"How has the case of Daria Morgendorffer's younger sister
being involved in another shooting affected the views of everyone involved?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mr. Hunt laughed cynically. <span class=GramE>"The NRA?</span>
<span class=GramE>Not at all.</span> The <span class=SpellE>N.O.W</span>. is
more nervous about supporting the Morgendorffers, but not enough to join us on
this important fight. To us it demonstrates that this is beyond a case of
domestic abuse and stalking, but a case involved in drugs and racist ideology."
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Who was the shooter that shot Officer Corelli, who is
still recovering in ICU, and Officer <span class=SpellE>Delancey</span>, who died
shortly after the shooting. Do you have any clue on who was involved in this
shooting?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No," he said. "We have sources that say the shooter is a
woman somehow connected to the Morgendorffers, but nothing beyond that. It is
unknown if she is a drug dealer, a member of a hate group, or just a random
shooter. But it's telling that she had a gun and she didn't shoot Daria
Morgendorffer, even though the girl was a witness to her serious crime. As to
why the Morgendorffer sisters have not been arrested, we don't know. Detective
Warner of the Lawndale PD has expressed frustration on this himself,
considering both girls to be, and I quote, 'menaces to society,' unquote." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"With the brutal slaying of Mrs. Brand, the candidate for
mayor of Lawndale and former executive officer of <span class=SpellE>HCI</span>
in Lawndale, aren't you worried about yourself, now that you're filling that
position?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Oh, yes," he replied. "I'm sure Daria was behind that
murder. Mrs. Brand reported Daria as belligerent and hostile, openly
championing the gunning down of anyone who stood in her way, and we have
footage being developed that proves this to be true. But she will know justice.
And we will make sure that no other young sociopaths get their hands on another
firearm." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"We understand that senatorial candidate Win Alexander, a
high ranking member of the NRA, is opposing you. How much of an obstacle have
he and the NRA proven to be?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The man sadly said, "They are willing to spend millions
defending Daria and her family. I hope it has become clear what kind of people
the NRA are when they even champion children shooting up their schools." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"How much resistance do you face?" she asked him. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Unfortunately, a lot," said Mr. Hunt with some
exasperation. "The NRA puts out millions of dollars in propaganda to twist the
facts. We're not like that at all. We just want some common sense gun control.
We can't figure out why we get so much opposition. Didn't the
guns-for-everybody president, Ronald Reagan, get gunned down by a mental
patient that bought his weaponry over the counter at a gun shop? The
conservatives should be helping us!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So what do you think will come out when this is all done?"
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I honestly don't know, except it's going to be dirty. I
agree that places like the Zen need to be shut down. Jane Lane, who was
originally arrested with the shooter and who, sources tell me, helped her sneak
a gun in the school in the first place, should be arrested. Her brother is a
member of the band, Mystik Spiral, that police believe may be doing and running
methamphetamines. It looks fairly clear the Morgendorffer girls are drug
dealers, their mother knows it and is covering up for them, and that these
shootings aren't self-defense but the battles over drug turf." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"And what about a race war?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The evidence is mostly circumstantial. However, Matthew
Foster's father is a known member of several racist hate groups and it seems
certain he influenced and armed his son. It is undeniable that everyone
involved in this are white, except for two victims, an Asian principal and a
black football player. I'd say there's some fire to that smoke myself." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Thank you, Mr. Hunt, and good luck with your project." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Thank you," replied Mr. Hunt. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"This is Laurie McKenzie, reporting for NPR, National
Public Radio." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>As NPR wound down, Helen was livid. <span class=GramE>"He...
she... <span class=SpellE>ooooo</span>!"</span> She stomped over to the counter
and started to make herself a sandwich. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The radio played the music for the news on the hour. A
report about an American spy plane crashing into a Chinese fighter jet yesterday
was the first line of discussion. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen sighed. "I hope this will take some of the attention
off of you. I mean this spy jet case could be really serious! At least Bush won't
be making any more boneheaded comments about you." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Just then, the news mentioned the shootings in Lawndale,
from the school shooting to Quinn and then that of the police officers, and
then reported that Bush had a statement. "We need," said George W. Bush over
the radio, "to stop the exquisite sex and wholesome violence that underscore
our children." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Did that make sense?" asked Daria, truly bewildered,
while Helen stared gape-jawed at the radio. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Next was a report of Enron repurchasing <span
class=SpellE>Chewco's</span> investment in JEDI for $35 million, netting Enron
executive Michael <span class=SpellE>Kopper</span> $10 <span class=GramE>million.</span>
Vice President Dick Cheney was quoted as saying, "Our energy commission has
hailed this buy out, and just goes to show that the economy is not doing so bad
after all, despite nay-<span class=SpellE>sayers</span> among the liberal
elites. This will mean safer and more efficient energy for all, and more jobs
for all." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria calmed her down with, "What were you saying about
having Geraldo Rivera arrested?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen blinked, and then shook her head bitterly as she
spread peanut butter on a slice of bread. "He wouldn't leave. I called the
police. They showed up in two to three minutes. Geraldo looked more surprised
than I did." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The phone Helen had left on the table rang. Daria picked
it up, saying, "Hello." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Daria?" asked Jake. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yes, Dad?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Where's your mother?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"She's venting steam right now. She just heard the news." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"About the case?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"That, and things like China blowing up one of our jets." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Lousy, stinking Communists," griped Jake. "Oh, we're
China and you're an enemy nation in our airspace, so we'll send our jets after
you. Just what were they thinking!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Maybe," said Daria slowly, "they were mad over some of
the nuclear secrets we sold them." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"We?" asked Jake weakly. "Daria, have you and Jane or
Quinn been, uh, selling anything I should know about?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"If I answered that, you would probably be killed." Daria
suddenly frowned, then smiled, at the thought that the cops were listening in
on this conversation. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Give me that, Daria!" shouted Helen grabbing the phone. "Both
of you, this is serious!" After listening to Jake for a minute, her eyes nearly
closed. "Jake, what did you want when you called?" She blinked and said, "Jake,
we have a lot of money coming in. We can always use more, but given the
economy, investing in the stock market isn't a good idea." Her eyes went wide. <span
class=GramE>"Enron?</span> Yes, I heard. I don't like it." Daria watched and
ate calmly as Helen shook her head and said into the phone, "No! I don't care
if the government says they're good..." Helen wandered into the living room. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria, finished eating and bored, frowned at the radio.
Someone was talking about Enron and what the latest buy out meant for the
economy. She went to turn it off, and then got curious. She flipped the dial
around, looking for some of the "right wing crazies." Maybe they said her
shooting a guy was good. Or maybe it would just amuse her. <i>Especially when
Mom comes in and I tell her it's making perfect sense.</i> She smiled wickedly.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She found it rather frustrating. It seemed everything was
music that was so old it was on the radio before Mom and Dad were born, or in
another language, or some sports, a weird Christian station where everyone had
some kind of accent that she couldn't place or music she identified right away,
or commercials. She stopped on Paul Harvey for a minute and listened to him
report an urban legend as fact before her nerves couldn't stand that voice
anymore. Then she finally caught a voice that sounded somehow fanatical, and
yet without the weird accent so many of the Christian radio people had. She
went and got some milk while she listened. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"... Bush's 'Job and Growth Plan' will save the <span
class=GramE>economy,</span> his tax cuts will increase jobs and prosperity for
all. It's not what the liberal whackos call 'misdirected tax cuts' or 'mismanaging
the economy.' What would liberals know about mismanaging the economy? They
continue to tax all people so that people can't pay the bills, and then call
the corporate entrepreneurs evil when they can't afford to pay their workers
more or hire more workers after they've been taxed of nearly all their capital.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Then the liberals shout raise the minimum wage and the 'evil
fat cats' lose more money and so let more people go. As a result, the economy
sinks. LIBERALS NEVER LEARN. Now Bush's 'Job and Growth Plan' will cut taxes
and bring America new jobs, finally doing something right... If Bush can make
the changes he wants to the Alternate Minimum Tax (AMT) it would give millions
of dollars to job providers all across the country, thus creating new jobs,
thus creating prosperity. Heck, with IBM and others, it could save them
BILLIONS. We're talking BILLIONS of new jobs, and the liberals, I don't
understand it folks, the liberals are against this! Don't these people ever
learn?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody><i>Job providers?</i></span></span><span
class=postbody> <span class=GramE>wondered</span> Daria. <i>They mean the rich,
who aren't anywhere as likely to spend any gains, then? How would that improve
the economy?</i> Daria shook her head. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Daria?" asked Helen entering the kitchen, "What's that?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I don't know," said Daria repressing a smile. "But he's
making perfect sense." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Making sense!? That's it, young lady, THERAPY!" She
walked briskly over and turned it off. "I hate that voice. Don't play it again."
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria crossed her arms. "Don't tell me what to do,
liberal." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"WHAT!? You watch your mouth young lady or I'll, I'll..." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Ground me?" asked Daria pointedly. When Helen blushed,
she finally showed mercy and gave that enigmatic smile of hers that Helen hated--but
it was obvious she was more relieved this time than annoyed. When she saw Helen
smile nervously, she changed the subject. "Dad being crazy again?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Your father feels he should be doing more. You can't
fault him for that. And no more telling your father you're a spy for China. His
nerves can't handle it." Helen, having finished her sandwich, got a pickle to
nibble on. When she didn't seem inclined to say anything else, Daria excused
herself to work on her story. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria tried to work, but other concerns kept intruding in
her mind. After awhile, she found her story wasn't helping her escape any more
and she put it away. She spent the next few hours reading <i>Making the Twinkie
Defense Work for YOU</i> until she fell asleep over the book. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Her dad woke her up to eat supper. At the table she
thought about asking Quinn how she was doing, but she seemed cut off from
everyone. That worried Daria, but she also understood. She'd be more worried if
Quinn were her old self. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Back in her room, she caught another thrilling episode of <i>Sick,
Sad World</i> The last one was called <b>Prophets of Doom</b>, where Jehovah's
Witnesses on crystal meth went berserk and tried cutting their way into the
front doors using chainsaws and axes of people who refused to listen and making
them listen to them witness for Jehovah. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She was gathering the energy to grab the remote and turn
it off when Scott Rhode's picture flashed on the screen. There was a thousand
dollar reward for information leading to his arrest. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Curious about what else would be on the news regarding
Scott and her sister, she decided to flip around and see what other news
programs were coming on. Her jaw clenched as she saw two of the NRA loons that
had made a spectacle of themselves in her home now on TV. Mr. Alexander still
wore the tacky tie that was supposed to be patriotic. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Why are so many feminists coming out on the side of
Daria?" asked a reporter. Daria listened more closely, heartened that SOMEONE
supported her, even if more than a few were probably like Ms. Barch. She smiled
at the heresy of the footage of two women holding a huge sign that boldly said
DEAD MEN DON'T RAPE. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Disgraceful," said Mr. Alexander. "I want you to know, I
fully support a woman's right to self-defense, but signs like that are just
disturbing." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>I find it disturbing that you're disturbed over that</i>,
thought Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"And look over there," said the interviewer pointing at some
other people, "there are some, from the Pink Pistols, a group of homosexuals
fighting for gun rights! They claim to be libertarian, not liberal. What do you
think of that?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mr. Powers still sounded like he was on speed. "The
Libertarian Party has become a pack of pro-homo, pro-wetback, pro-abortion
mutts who will hunt with ANYONE! These are positions that are completely out of
touch with the nation and quite frankly, OUT TO LUNCH! They are the politically
homeless who are just looking for more injured mutts with home they can huddle
up and lick each others wounds." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mr. Alexander smiled and added, "The Libertarian Party
means well, and is certainly a better choice than the Democratic Party.
However, my associate is as correct in his statement as he is passionate in
stating it." He leaned forward a little and looked directly into the camera. "But
now is not the time for partisan politics. Our children's lives are on the
line. Contrary to what some say, we do not support Daria or what she did,
though we are glad she only managed to shoot that one drug dealer before he
could actually kill anyone. We endorse RESPONSIBLE gun ownership and use, not
wild, teenage vigilantes." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"What about protest votes? Do you think you will lose any
votes that way?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Unfortunately, a few bad apples in the GOP, who are being
pursued and thrown out as quickly as can happen, have caused some to act like
rats in a sinking ship. Friends, I'm warning you that the liberals are VERY
united and will WIN in future elections and measures if we can't stick
together. I understand why some feel we in the GOP are not doing enough, but
what you must also understand is we're doing all that we are able in the face
of liberal politicians, organizations, and media. And their preaching fear is
sometimes more effective than our preaching truth. This is NOT the time to cast
protest votes for the Libertarian Party. <span class=GramE>To do so is to damn
this country to liberal domination.</span> You stand with us, or you stand
against us. Right now, as united as the liberals are, there is no other
alternative. If you think we are not doing enough, imagine how much worse it
will be when the government, media, and country are wholly liberal instead of
partially liberal." He shook his head and emphasized his next statement: "A vote
for libertarians is a vote for liberals." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Indeed, a scary thought. I want to thank you for taking
the time from your busy schedule to talk to us. I know how difficult it was for
you to arrange time to be here today." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Thank you," returned Mr. Alexander, just before the show
went to break. Daria changed the channel, sarcastically thinking <span
class=GramE><i>Damn</i></span><i> liberal mudslinging</i>. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Her eyes opened wide as she saw the outside of her own
home on one channel. She had seen a lot of this lately, but she was amazed by
who she saw talking on the screen: Geraldo Rivera, whom her mom had arrested
today. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Estimates are that there are over 1 million Nazis in this
country," said Geraldo Rivera on the screen, "The majority of them are linked
in a highly organized, very secretive network. From small towns to large
cities, they have attracted police and FBI attention to their hate crimes,
aggressive recruitment and horrifying terrorism. The odds are that this is
happening in your town." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Footage of bullet holes in Scott's house and in the halls
of Lawndale High were shown as Geraldo's voice continued, "Guns gives these
twisted teens the power, dominance and control that they crave. Some of these
kids are miserable enough to kill and use neo-Nazi ideologies as an excuse and
for a sense of being part of something bigger and meaningful." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The footage changed to that of the guns and Nazi paraphernalia
taken from the cabin owned by Roger Foster, and then to that of Daria being
escorted away from Lawndale High on the morning of the shooting. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"As many of you know, I was personally attacked by the
leader of the White Aryan Resistance Youth program, so I am taking a HUGE
personal risk by pursuing Daria Morgendorffer, even without the implications of
the chain of violence and murder that surround America's most nefarious teen." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>On the screen he walked up to the front door of the
Morgendorffer's house, while some kind of 80s beat slowly played, suggesting
courage in the face of danger. Mr. Rivera knocked on the door. Waiting briefly,
he knocked again. The door opened and one could make out Helen, if you already
knew what she looked like. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Please, <span class=GramE>sir," she said stiffly, "go</span>
away now before I call the police. I assure you, they will arrive quickly and
dump your butt in the jail so they can collect the money in fining your rich
butt." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Morg</span>--" began Mr. Rivera,
but Helen slammed the door in his face. After a minute, he turned around,
shaking his head and spreading his arms. "Apparently, Daria Morgendorffer is so
guilty that her mother, a lawyer who knows the importance of the media, cannot
allow her to make a simple statement. I think it's clear how Daria
Morgendorffer turned out the way she did." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The following news program reported her and Quinn as drug
dealers. They also said Officer Corelli had regained consciousness briefly, and
they hoped he would have information that would reveal the shooter. <i>Strange
that they don't mention Beavis and Butthead</i>, thought Daria idly. They had
been mentioned on the day of the shooting, and then only vaguely referred to
the day after. Now, it sounded as if some woman talking to Daria coldly turned
and shot the two cops for no reason other than sheer rabidity. She knew that
meant something, though she didn't know what, but she was content to let her subconscious
work on it for now. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She came back to the Fox channel. Fair and Balanced
reporting was going on in the "No Spin Zone" with a blonde woman for a guest
and Mr. Bill O'Reilly presiding. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The woman in a blue dress, with long, blonde hair falling
over her shoulders, was looking out of the screen. "I remember when I was stuck
on a bridge in Washington DC," she was saying, "and someone who meant me harm
was approaching. I didn't have a gun as it's a felony to have a gun in
Washington DC. The results aren't just one of the highest murder rates in the
country, but the criminals like that man walk up to women like me without fear.
I am woman, I can vote, my body is sacred, and yet I can't defend myself and my
body from harm." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Do you think," said Mr. O'Reilly, "that liberals WANT you
to be mugged, WANT you to be raped, WANT you to be murdered, so they can then
use that to impose more of their laws and gun control on society?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I don't know, but they obviously have a very sick mind.
They KNOW what effects their laws have, and their solution is always more,
more, more. Either liberals are evil, or they are very, very sick. Otherwise,
why do they force women to be so helpless? Or for that matter, why do they cast
suspicion on our police and military and then insist only our police and
military have guns?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So what happened with the thug on the bridge?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Oh," said the woman with a hint of humor, "a <b>man</b>
came along and helped." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Was he a liberal?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>They both laughed, along with the audience. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I want to show you something," said O'Reilly, "to prove
that liberals know what you know, indeed what we all know." He turned to
someone off screen. "Roll that tape we found." Turning back to his guest, he
added, "You're not going to believe what we found." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Footage came on marked, "Arms &amp; <span class=GramE>The</span>
Woman. CBS 60 Minutes. Broadcast Sunday 10 October 1993." Daria saw one of the
reporters from the show, but she wasn't sure if it was Mike Wallace or that <span
class=GramE>Safer</span> guy. She didn't watch the show enough to be sure which
was which. (She only recognized Bill O'Reilly because MAD magazine satirized
him so much.) He was saying that in 1989, Smith and Wesson introduced a gun
line called the "Ladysmith." By 1991, sales of guns to women doubled. "Why," he
wondered, "do 15-20 million women own guns?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He went to footage of an interview with author and
Firearms Instructor Paxton Quigley. She asserted that training women to use
guns is a form of equality, a form of feminist empowerment. She pointed out
that men have used guns as tools for hundreds of years, while traditionally
many women have not. The interviewer noted that she had once been a gun-control
activist with <span class=SpellE>HCI</span>. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He showed a clip of her teaching the use of firearms, and
then returned to the recorded interview. She told how a friend had heard a man
breaking into her house. She called the police and begged for help. The man
broke in, raped the woman, and left. The police arrived 30 minutes after the
emergency call had been placed. That, Quigley said, was when she first decided
to buy a gun. In time she came to reject <span class=SpellE>HCI</span> and its
anti-gun dogma. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The simple fact," said the <span class=GramE>interviewer,</span>
"is that women are buying guns like never before." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>A nurse in Kentucky, Rhonda Carter, reported how she
routinely carried a gun on the advice of her husband. He was a police officer
who worked nights. Getting out of her car late one night, she was grabbed by a
man who ripped her clothes and stated his intent to rape her. In the struggle,
she shot him and he died of a bullet in the heart. When asked if she had any
remorse (and Daria heard Bill O'Reilly's audience groan in the background), she
said, "No. He attacked me and I defended myself. It sounds callous, but no." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Then a woman named Sylvia <span class=SpellE>Hazzard</span>
was interviewed. She had carried a gun in her purse. One night she was
kidnapped at gun point and forced to drive to an isolated area in the local
mountains. Her assailant raped her. He then ordered her to put her clothes on
and get out of the vehicle. Her cigarettes and purse (with gun inside) were on
the floor. She asked if she could get her cigarettes, and he pointed his gun at
her head and told her, "No. You won't <span class=GramE>be needing</span>
those." Ms. <span class=SpellE>Hazzard</span> said she felt sure, at that
moment, that he meant to kill her, and so she had nothing to lose. She grabbed
the purse and got her gun. The rapist fired and missed. She fired and hit. The
rapist died. She told the interviewer that now she won't go anywhere without
her gun. (Daria heard a faint cheering of O'Reilly's audience.) </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The next interview was with Sarah Brady of Handgun
Control, Inc. Ms. Brady claimed that while handguns may make women feel safer,
women are in fact less safe after buying a gun. She proclaimed, "If more guns
made us safer, then America would be the safest nation in the world." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. Brady then blamed the gun industry and people like
Paxton Quigley, who had once worked for her, for needless gun deaths. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>In return, Paxton Quigley told that she has trained some
3500 women to shoot and that these women have told her amazing stories. A brief
cut was shown of her telling how a stalker with a restraining order against him
continued to stalk his ex. The police failed to stop him. His ex, armed and
trained to use her gun, did not fail. There were some real similarities with
Matthew in that case, only it seemed that woman didn't go to prison the way
Daria was likely to do. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Then the scene went back to O'Reilly and his guest. "Sarah
Brady and the CDC went on to say that guns were a health hazard." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I wonder how much grant money CDC got for that?" murmured
the blonde. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Bill O'Reilly laughed cynically, "I hope it's not enough
to make them sleep easy at night. Now the question is, if the liberals know
women are safer with guns, then why <span class=GramE>are they</span> trying to
stop women from having guns?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"As you say," replied the blonde, "they know. So they must
be evil, or very, very sick. They most definitely hate America. A liberal will
bleed for a serial rapist and his rights while ignoring the rights of a woman.
In fact, a liberal disarms women to make it easier to rape them in the first
place." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I still don't get how the media will defend rapists and
batterers if a woman defends herself with a gun and yet feminist organizations
continue to use them as their Bible," O'Reilly said. "That seems inconsistent."
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The woman added, "The <i>New York Times</i> has viciously
denounced Attorney General John Ashcroft for having the temerity to suggest
that the Second Amendment protects the 'right of the people to keep and bear
arms' as it most certainly does. What the paper is doing, besides attacking the
Constitution, is defending the Central Park rapists. I think the feminist
organizations are starting to wake up and realize that. Maybe they'll realize
that the papers are lying to them when they demonize us, too." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"In a country where the National Organization of Women
have attacked any woman that even suggested impropriety from a Democratic
candidate, have opposed Republicans that have tried to pass a victim's rights
amendment that would stand by rape victims more than the rapists, and have even
joined Hillary Clinton in destroying any woman that dares tell the truth about
Bill Clinton, can feminism be trusted?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The blonde shook her head, a look of disgust on her face. "First,
you have to realize that the National Organization of Women is not about
feminism, it's about partisanship. Second, they got a huge government grant to
back the Clintons. Third, they need women to be victims to justify the
socialized evil the Democrats are trying to force on us all. It's not feminism,
<span class=GramE>it's</span> <b>communism</b>. Tammy Bruce, who served as
president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Organization for Women, is
beginning to tell us what went on inside the N-O-W, and it's not pretty, and it's
not about empowering women, but empowering the Democratic Party. More and more
women are coming to realize this, too." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So women could start to vote Republican?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Tammy Bruce did. Still, plenty of women would rather have
daycare centers than a strong military, so the <span class=SpellE>Demoleftists</span>
will promise them diaper changes and no police or military protection against
those foul perverts who would despoil women and children." She snorted her
contempt and added, "And <span class=GramE>disarm</span> the law abiding, thus
empowering the criminals, and when rapes rise, as they will, blame the guns instead
of the liberals who are soft on crime and evil in their policy making." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Bill O'Reilly, shaking his head, went, "Can you imagine
how <b>evil</b> it is to try to deny guns to women, and to the elderly, and to
those most vulnerable by criminals, only to defend the rights of these scumbags
after they strike? And how can women support this?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Also shaking her head, the blonde replied, "I think women
are finally waking up to what is going on, and how the National Organization of
Women has betrayed feminism and betrayed women by defending rapists and by
defending dirty old men like Clinton." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Do you think the feminists will start to listen to us? Is
it really possible?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The woman shrugged. "Our audiences are primarily people
who work for a living. But it is possible that as the economy improves under
Bush's tax plan, and liberals continue to defend rapists and homicidal
stalkers, that they'll start to trickle over to our side. Believe me, when you're
facing down someone who wants to hurt, rape, and kill you, as a woman, you
learn real fast that guns are our friends!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Bill O'Reilly shook his head. "No, they equate gun control
with peace." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Whether on a national or personal scale, peace comes
through superior firepower. That's another point I think the feminists are
starting to realize." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Well I sure wouldn't harass a woman with a gun," said O'Reilly
to laughter, "maybe make some obscene calls...no, just kidding." He and the
blonde laughed. "Well, I think we know who the true feminists are, though, don't
we?" said Bill O'Reilly. The crowd cheered wildly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Not the liberals," replied the woman. "Another thing
about liberals is their always being against America. Everything is the fault
of America, or third world savages are good. You can't say what we're saying
right now, the truth, without them shouting, 'McCarthyism!' A term they made up
after defaming a great man that probably saved this country." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"As I said before, my guest is Anne Coulter," continued
Bill O'Reilly, "author of numerous books and articles, and one of the women
most feared by liberals for telling the truth about Clinton, and for telling
the truth about them. If you haven't gotten her excellent, excellent books,
like <i>High Crimes and Misdemeanors: <span class=GramE>The Case Against</span>
Bill Clinton</i>, I strongly recommend them. I especially ask the feminists to
read about the sexual crimes and rapes committed by Clinton that the National
Organization of Women defended, aided, and abetted. Then I think you'll agree
that Anne Coulter is perhaps the TRUE feminist. Now let's take a look at some
of the pseudo-feminists." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Footage obviously recorded elsewhere came on, but it was
unclear if it was collected by Fox specifically, or through another network. A
female talking head was saying, "According to the National Women's Law Center,
17 million women would receive no tax cut under Bush's plan yet three million
families headed by women with children have an income below the federal poverty
rate That's a large group that gets no benefit. Four out of 10 single mothers
and nearly 5 out of 10 African American and Hispanic mothers would see no
benefit." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The scene changed back to O'Reilly who said, "Don't you
liberals understand that you can get <b>jobs</b> now? Well, not now, but soon.
They also blasted Bush for his reinstating Ronald Reagan's Gag ruling of 1984,
which doesn't give money for those who practice abortions." He shook his head
before adding, "Liberals can't stand smoking, but they got to make sure we can
have our abortions! Women can't be trusted with a gun, but serial rapists have
got to be afforded every right, especially if the rapist is a minority. Then
provide welfare by taxing people into poverty. I don't get their hypocrisy!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Me, neither," returned Ms. Coulter, "but I'm all too used
to it." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria sighed, rolling her eyes, as she remembered just
seeing Mr. Alexander of the Republican Party on another channel declaiming
Daria's feminist supporters as "disgraceful" and "disturbing." In contrast, the
liberals of NPR expressed disappointment that the NOW was taking a neutral
stance and feminists in general seemed to be backing her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Of course, both Mr. Alexander and this show were promoting
partisan agendas over real issues, just as they were accusing their wild-eyed
counterparts on the other side. <i>They should call this show, 'The Kettle
Hour, Where We Prove the Pot is Black!<span class=GramE>'<span
style='font-style:normal'>.</span></span></i> Daria smirked, thinking of how
the Democrats would likely respond by saying the show promoted marijuana use.
Then she focused on the sideshow again: </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Let me play some footage of someone sane for a change,"
said O'Reilly. <span class=GramE>"An interview done with Mr. Ralph Reed."</span>
The screen showed Ralph Reed talking outside a building with what looked like
late afternoon traffic going by. The interviewer was male, but you could only
tell by his voice. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The voice asked, "Why do these liberals only give one side
of the story?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I don't know," said Ralph Reed, "that is an excellent
question." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"What can we do about the liberal media?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Ignore it." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Ignore it?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Sure," he said, "Twenty-five years ago, most people got
their news from ABC, CBS, or NBC. Fortunately, that is no longer the case. The
gatekeepers of the dominant media have lost their monopoly on information. But
I, and other good Christians, haven't watched a major network in years. I get
in the car in the morning and listen to Rush Limbaugh. On the way home, I
listen to Sean <span class=SpellE>Hannity</span>. At night, I watch Fox News. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"People are starting to wake up to the bias of the media
at large and turning to Fox. That's a good thing. We're going to take this
country back. Remember the <span class=GramE>words of Ronald Reagan, the
trouble with our liberal friends is</span> not that they're ignorant: It's that
they know so much that isn't so." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"To that I can say 'amen,' Mr. Reed. Thank you for talking
with us today." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The show returned to Bill O'Reilly and Anne Coulter. "Now,"
said O'Reilly, "let's take a look at footage taken today outside the building
in Newport where Mr. Alexander was speaking." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The scene showed many people standing outside a building.
Most look respectable and some hold signs, but other protesters were not as
demure. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>O'Reilly explained, "A lot of this is over a girl who shot
a drug dealer, gun blazing. He was trying to kill a girl who had a restraining
order against him. But he failed because another student was armed. Maybe she
wasn't entirely blameless herself, but she still saved her sister. And this has
exposed the idiocy of liberalism and gun control laws and what they really
think of women, don't you agree Anne?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Oh, absolutely," said Ms. Coulter, "the REAL feminist is
a supporter of the NRA. Ask Arming Women Against Rape and Endangerment. They're
just one group of women that knows for women to be safe and <span class=GramE>secure,</span>
they need a couple of pounds of iron to even things out. And a gun is worth a
ton of restraining orders." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Let me show you this part," added O'Reilly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>On the screen were more protesters. One was a woman with a
placard that read, "CIA Approved Fox News Channel," and another had a sign that
read "Vote Republican" with a swastika emblazoned across it. Another sign
showed a hooded <span class=SpellE>KKK</span> member with the phrase "compassionate
conservatism?" Another was a red flag with the Fox logo and the swastika. On it
was inscribed <span class=GramE>"We instruct, you obey."</span> Another showed
the GOP elephant with 666 on it. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Look at these people," said Mr. O'Reilly. "These liberal
reactionaries equate any who dissent from their hardcore socialist line to be
Nazi hate mongers out to destroy America. Their continual use of scare tactics,
false claims of media monopoly by the right, hypocrisy in upholding the morals
of their own leftist candidates, and acting as if they're martyrs valiantly
persevering against vast persecution makes me sick." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. Coulter shook her head in disgust. "They're like
escapees from <span class=SpellE>Pescadero</span> Mental Institution." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He stared now at the camera, seeming to look right at the
viewer, "Well, I'm tired of these un-American Communists trying to destroy all
decency in support of their lying politicians, Communist News Network, and <span
class=SpellE>siccing</span> the ACLU on anyone who thinks Christianity is what
this nation was founded on. We should be able to speak our minds, but the
socialists try to shut us up at every turn, and brainwash our children in
public schools." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He shook his head resolutely. "Will the liberals look out
for you? No, and neither will the wealthy, not the greedy corporations, and
sure as hell not the media. Our news station is under constant assault, but I'll
be looking out for you." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Great," said Daria out loud to herself, "We have a really
wealthy guy who works for a greedy media corporation to protect us from the
greedy corporations." She flipped channels again, now utterly bored, and paused
on one that showed an interview with Scott Rhode's mother. Apparently she was
more worried about losing her home to drug seizure laws than about her son
missing and with a stolen gun. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria hit the remote to turn the TV off when she heard a
knock at the door. She was bored with all of it by then anyway. She couldn't
remember the last time she had watched so much in one sitting, but she did
remember now why she didn't make a habit of it. "Enter," she said. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn came in, closing the door behind her, and sat down
on Daria's bed beside her. Quinn hadn't shut herself in Daria's room before.
Daria knew this was going to be good. Then Quinn asked, "What were you
watching?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She only blinked once before answering, "The responsible
adult's version of gossip and rumor mongering at Lawndale High. <span
class=GramE>Just... nothing.</span> <span class=SpellE>Unevolved</span> monkeys
flinging crap at each other." When Quinn just looked down, her voice softened. "What
is it?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn looked back up. "Daria," she asked in a tone Daria
hadn't heard Quinn used before, "what do you think happens to us when we die?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria blinked in surprise. Before she thought about it,
she said, "I think we're taken to Chicago and forced to vote Democrat till the
end of time. Why?" When Quinn continued to stare at her pleadingly, Daria took
in a deep breath and exhaled. "Sorry. I forgot to wear my tinfoil beanie before
watching Fox." Quinn smiled only a little. "So this Scott person really has you
bothered, huh?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn nodded. "Buffy can only be around for awhile. I had
to depend on you to save me at first. And then Buffy kept the nightmares away,
but only most of the time. Then when Scott tried killing me... all Buffy did
was cause his <span class=SpellE>supergun</span> to jam. I mean that's good and
impressive and all but that wasn't enough. It was the stuff in that women's
self-defense class that helped me. I mean Buffy helped a little, but still... I'm
scared." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Do you have nightmares about Scott, too, now?" asked
Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yes," said Quinn. "But the guns in my dreams work now. So
do my martial arts. But I dreamed Scott crawled through my window and chased
me. He was also Matthew at the same time. I didn't have a gun. All I could do
was run. He shot me and I woke up." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Where was Buffy?" asked Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I don't know," said Quinn. "She says it tires her to do
too much. So I guess she was resting. That's why she's not enough to save me. I
have to save myself." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Why couldn't Buffy tell you not to go on a date with this
Scott anyway? I mean it couldn't take too much energy to check out your date,
right?" asked Daria. Right after she said it, Daria wished she hadn't, but it
was too late to take it back then. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I don't know," said Quinn. "I guess Buffy didn't know." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"And Buffy doesn't know what happens after we die, huh?"
asked Daria cautiously, but believing Quinn wasn't going to freak out on her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn shrugged. "I asked, but the answer didn't make any
sense. That happens sometimes. Like when I tried to get Buffy's true name, I
just couldn't hear it. Some things we weren't meant to know." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria caught herself from an exclamation at that point.
Quinn needed all the comfort she could get with Scott on the loose. After a
pause, she said, "Well, I certainly don't know, Quinn. But I know while I'm
alive, I'll do whatever I can to keep you alive, too." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn broke down and cried then, and without any thought,
Daria embraced her, with Quinn returning the embrace. "I don't understand,"
cried Quinn, tears dropping down her face, "I worked so hard for everybody's
approval but yours and in the end it was you who stood up for me. I just don't
get it." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I'm pretty comfortable in my hell," said Daria, a little
teasingly, "and it just wouldn't be hell without you." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn actually laughed a little at that. Then she looked
at Daria again. Daria felt anger again as she looked on her battered face. "I
used to wish Matthew in Hell," said Quinn, "only I don't anymore. I mean, it's
like he was already in Hell, and now he's free. But I'm still stuck here in <span
class=GramE>Hell,</span> even with a guardian angel, and I don't know how to
get out." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Huh?" asked Daria, in true confusion. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn wiped a few tears away, and pulled slightly away
from Daria. "Everything Matthew did was so people would like him, be impressed
with him. He wanted to be 'the Man' or 'all that' or whatever. But he was from
a trashy home with parents more fucked up than ours." She swallowed. "I mean
really fucked up. And in a way it's kinda impressive what he managed to do." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"It just cost him his soul," said Daria, finding it weird
to hear Quinn casually use the word "fuck." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The world bled his soul dry and then he managed to make
do with what he had," said Quinn. "And you know why I dated him?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The mind boggles," said Daria calmly. "His hot car, his
money, his popularity which grew from these things, competition with the
Fashion Drones, or something like that." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You're seeing the trees, but not the forest," replied
Quinn casually. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Huh?" asked Daria. Quinn was definitely changing. She
just hoped the changes were good and not bad. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"It's all about image, Daria. Matthew didn't have
anything, so he made an image that he had it. And I did the same." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria shook her head. "I'm sorry, I really don't
understand. But I want to." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn smiled. "I know. That's why I came to you. And I'm
not sure I understand, either." After a pause, she added, "I worked to achieve
popularity. No one really cared for me. They were concerned with themselves and
their projects. I got to be the same way. And I needed someone to care for me,
someone to make me feel safe. And I thought I had it with my looks and by
winning all the right games. But I wasn't popular at all. When I need them
everyone just runs or falls on the ground or cries under their desk. It was all
an image that meant nothing. Only you're here for me. You and Buffy." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Um," said Daria, amazed that Quinn would have such
insights. She swallowed as she remembered Quinn surprising her with an insight
into why she, Daria, was so unfriendly. That had happened when Quinn was crying
over David, her tutor, for his rejection. She had to admit, in her own <span
class=GramE>way,</span> Quinn was very intelligent--almost as smart as Daria
herself, just not in a "brainy" way. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn smiled at the one word Daria managed to get out. "Matthew
needed to be loved and cared for. He got that by becoming someone that people
were dependent on. By doing that, he also became rich and got all the right
clothes, the right car, and everything else. He even got me to complete his
image. I did the same with him. He was just a way to get back at Sandi, to play
the game. We used each other and we were both after the same thing. And neither
one of us had what we thought we had. It was all..." Quinn shook her head, "illusion."
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Quinn," said Daria concerned, "this is true of a lot of
people. At least you can see through it now--" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I didn't WANT to see through it," exclaimed Quinn. "I'm
scared seeing through it. Okay, I was scared before, only I didn't know of
what. But now I know what I'm really afraid of and I don't know what to do
about it! At least before, I thought I knew what I could do and so I had hope!"
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Um," said Daria, "what do you think you'd need now?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I need to be strong, like you or Buffy," said Quinn. She
looked up to Daria then and added, "<span class=GramE>and</span> you're a lot
stronger than you think you are, Daria. Really, you are. I can see that now. I'm
the one who's weak." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Is that why you wanted the gun and the classes in martial
arts?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yeah," said Quinn. "I don't know if it's enough, but it's
a start. When Buffy did all she could to save me, it came down to what I can
do. It was enough for that night. Except for the police." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I don't know if there's anything you can do about them,"
said Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"There's always something you can do. You can be
invisible. You can find strength with others. You can become rich enough that
the law doesn't want to touch you." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You have... a plan?" asked Daria, stunned that Quinn
would think like that. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn nodded. "Become the best damn martial artist ever,"
she said. "And learn to shoot. Get a gun as soon as I can. Take acting lessons.
Become a movie star, either martial arts or action, I haven't decided. Achieve
such fame and wealth that no cop would dare touch me, and have a bunch of
bodyguards around me." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria blinked. She quickly decided not to mention Marilyn
Monroe... or Bruce Lee. "That's... some vision you have there, Quinn. I'm
impressed." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Thanks," said Quinn. "Buffy was telling me that I shouldn't
give up all that I had learned, only to be aware of its limitations. That's
what I'm doing now." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Actually, Quinn... that's a decent plan. I mean there
will be the tabloids, other people of your caliber, the dirty deals, maybe even
blackmail and extortion... but I've heard much worse. I really do think you can
do it if you want." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn smiled a little at Daria. "Thanks, Daria. That means
something to me. You're really smart. <span class=GramE>But..." <br>
<br>
"What?" asked Daria.</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn shrugged. "It's going to be many years before that happens.
And it could only be a few minutes until Scott breaks in and kills us all." She
leaned back into Daria, and Daria embraced her again. This time, Quinn didn't
cry. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"We're under police surveillance," said Daria. "After what
happened the last time there was trouble, I doubt they'll be caught by surprise
again. We're safe." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The cops are stupid," said Quinn, still leaning against
Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria smiled. "Yes, they most certainly are. But Scott isn't
exactly experienced or resourceful. I'm not saying he's dumb, but he would be
stupid to come here. If he's smart, he'll be a long way from Lawndale by now." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>A couple of minutes later, Quinn looked back up. "Thanks,
Daria." She kissed Daria on the cheek and hugged her again. She got up and
left, saying, "<span class=SpellE>G'night</span>." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Goodnight," said Daria, feeling a little dazed by all of
that. Not even bothering to get ready for bed, she lay down and went to sleep
figuring she'd rather clean herself up when everyone else was asleep. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn got ready for bed. In her room, she put on an <span
class=SpellE>Opeth</span> CD. She giggled a bit as she wondered what the
Fashion Club would do if they knew she even had an <span class=SpellE>Opeth</span>
CD. As the <span class=SpellE>prog</span>-rock played softly, she glanced
nervously at her window and turned her lamp off, leaving the room in darkness.
Then she went up to her window and stared out. She saw what she assumed to be
the police watching her house. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Buffy?" Quinn asked. She felt Buffy approaching, so she
said her name again to help. "Buffy?" Quinn said it softly so that no one was
likely to hear her talking out loud. She could talk silently, but it was harder
that way for some reason. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody><i>Yes, Quinn?</i></span></span><span
class=postbody> <span class=GramE>Faint, but solid.</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Are those the cops?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody><i>Yes, Quinn.</i></span></span><span
class=postbody> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Are they scared or bored?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody><i>Both.</i></span></span><span
class=postbody> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Will they stop Scott if he comes?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Buffy said something that didn't translate into Quinn's
mind and Quinn sighed. She felt a bit of an apology from Buffy. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn went back to her bed and chose the dark. It would be
harder for Scott to see in or get in if he made it in. "Matthew had to be the
best. He had to have the money, the car, the best girl, and everything. He
needed it because he needed everyone else's validation. Aren't I the same?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>Yes.</i> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Why?" Quinn's voice was weaker now. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>You hadn't learned enough to be on your own.</i> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I've learned so much now, Buffy," Quinn mumbled sleepily.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>Yes, but are you ready to <b>learn</b> to stand up on
your own feet without being carried by everyone else?</i> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn blinked, surprised by her own answer. "Yes," she
said. "Yes, I am." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Buffy began shining brightly and Quinn squinted against
the light of it. She found she could barely move, like the time Buffy first
came to her. "Buffy?" Quinn asked. "What's happening? Are you leaving me?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody><i>Yes, Quinn.</i></span></span><span
class=postbody><i> I was here to get you on the path. I leave you this light to
shine in your soul. You will be your own guardian angel. Everything you need is
within yourself. A little bit of me is in this light, and I will come again
when you truly need me to stand by you. Until then, you are your own Buffy.</i>
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn felt a Power deep within her wake itself, a Power
she never even suspected she had. Her entire body sang with the ecstasy of it
and she silently laughed in pleasure. She went deep into sleep, and when Scott
came for her, it was Scott's gun that didn't work. Quinn walked up fearlessly
and took the gun out of his hand and twisted it with her hands. Scott ran. Then
Matthew leaped at her, a vampiric demon. A swift horizontal fist and Matthew
was blown into oblivion. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>As she fell into empowering dreams that promised her a
Power within, <span class=SpellE>Opeth</span> played <i>Death Whispered a
Lullaby</i>: </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>Out on the road there are fireflies circling </i></span><i><br>
<span class=postbody>Deep in the woods, where the lost souls hide </span><br>
<span class=postbody>Over the hill there are men returning </span><br>
<span class=postbody>Trying to find some peace of mind </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Sleep my child... </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Under the fog there are shadows moving </span><br>
<span class=postbody>Don't be afraid, hold my hand </span><br>
<span class=postbody>Into the dark there are eyelids closing </span><br>
<span class=postbody>Buried alive in the shifting sands </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Sleep my child... </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Speak to me now and the world will crumble </span><br>
<span class=postbody>Open a door and the moon will fall </span><br>
<span class=postbody>All of your life, all your memories </span><br>
<span class=postbody>Go to your dreams, forget it all </span><br>

<span class=postbody>--------------------------------------------- </span><br>
<span class=postbody>04/02/01 MONDAY 11:00 P.M. </span><br>
<span class=postbody>---------------------------------------------- </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>FBI Agent Chin had been undercover in Lawndale for months,
working with the amphetamines dealer known on the streets as "Evil Eddie." It
wasn't a job she'd wanted to do, but the FBI said they thought he was involved
in selling weapons to foreign and local terrorist organizations. Neither the
DEA nor the BATF could be trusted, her boss had told her. And Evil Eddie had
been looking for a secretary as part of his "new image" of moving up in the
world shortly after the disappearance of the previous alpha of
methamphetamines. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She was the first of three agents to apply. He hired her
almost on the spot. This surprised her for she had been told he was one of
those "Aryan" racists. She later came to realize he wasn't particularly racist,
though many of his associates were. He even chastised those who called her
gook, chink, or slant. He'd had some bad experiences with African Americans,
but he just coldly dismissed any that weren't rivals, and not many were in the
same market. And he had the useful misconception that the FBI didn't hire
people of Asian descent. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Chin had been working with the FBI and the criminal
underworld for a couple of years now and she was hard pressed to say which was
more paranoid and more plagued by idiocy and SNAFU. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>For the last six months she had been on the inside,
working from a front known as Sherman Storage that supposedly held furniture
and other supplies in rented self-storage units for people on the move,
watching every move Evil Eddie made and dodging his romantic overtures. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>But he eventually let her in on his "secret" which wasn't
that tightly kept in the first place. He had even seemed to come to respect
her, but he still tried getting into her pants by persuasion and endless
flirtation. All the while, she sabotaged his schemes, filed reports on his
operations, and reaped valuable information on his business and his clients. And
her boss, Patterson, STILL wasn't satisfied because he wanted the terrorists or
their connection. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She held on because she thought there might be something
to it. Eddie had been getting more and more paranoid, and Agent Chin didn't
think he was using his own product or any other drugs. But he had a history of
drug abuse, so he could've been slipping back into it. But then again, what if
he knew someone else that the FBI was really after? Someone who might want to
silence Evil Eddie? Maybe this new "threat" of his was the one the FBI was
looking for. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Evil Eddie came up to her and kissed the back of her neck.
She twisted out and he laughed lightly, enjoying their dance. She wondered what
he would do if she ever kissed him back. He just smiled at her and handed <span
class=GramE>her the</span> keys to the van. She took them, blinking, and he
said, "I think we're gonna finally catch these motherfuckers." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Who?" asked Agent Chin. She had been trained well not to
assume. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The sons of bitches that have been cutting in on my
territory," he said. "Did you call McGrundy's?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yeah," she said, "Mystik Spiral is playing there. So far,
they're the only band they have signed up." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Makes sense," he replied, "since that's the first place
we go." He frowned. He'd had them followed, and even sent people to talk to
them directly, and by all appearances they didn't have anything to do with his
product. So why were the fingers still pointing at them? He was hoping to find
out tonight. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Chin narrowed her eyes. "I don't like this, it sounds
dangerous." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He flashed his eyes at her flirtatiously again. She sighed
in exasperation as he said, "Worried about me, huh?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Worried about having to find a new employer," she said,
and he laughed. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She quickly walked into the garage to see half a dozen
armed thugs standing and smoking cigarettes. Every one of them had a gun in
sight, and one of those guns looked like a Mac-11 SMG. Another had an AR-15
right beside him. They all stared at her and she got the impression that some
didn't like her and that they were all jacked up. She swallowed. She jumped a
bit when Evil Eddie came past her, slapping her butt. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"We're leaving," said Evil Eddie harshly to the men. He
almost never talked to her that way. One opened the back of the van and the
others piled in, one grabbing the AR-15 before he got in. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Chin was nervous. They looked high on the shit Evil
Eddie made, and she didn't know how anyone could remain alive, let alone sane,
once they put that stuff in their veins. For that matter, how could any sane
person put that stuff in their body in the first place? But she also knew if
they were pulled over by the cops, it could be a blood bath. Two cops had just
been shot, and one of them was dead. But if this led to whomever she had been
hired to find out about, then she didn't see any other option. She'd been at
this long enough and wanted it over. So she got in and drove. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>But nothing came of it. McGrundy's was calm, having just
opened after repairing some water damage. It wasn't Evil Eddie's type of place,
really, though he didn't mind it. But he was too excited to enjoy what little
of it he could, and then disappointed. He glared angrily at Mystik Spiral
playing on stage, and Agent Chin passed a trained eye around. She noticed that
someone took a picture of them. They struck her as being cops and she chose to
say nothing to Evil Eddie, but it made her nervous. Did whoever called them
also call the police? <span class=GramE>If so, why?</span> Or was the contact a
cop? If so, what game were they playing? She'd have to ask her support team to
look into it as soon as she had a chance. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Chin studied Mystik Spiral and didn't think they had
anything to do with drug dealing. They were musicians. They might be users, but
probably of pot, not speed. H at <span class=GramE>worse,</span> and she
doubted it. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Come on," said an annoyed Evil Eddie. "We're leaving." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Chin readily got up. Another thing she had to be
nervous about was the two guys Eddie had left in the van. If he stayed inside
for too long, they had orders to come in ready for trouble. Jacked up,
paranoid, and heavily armed, trouble was assured if they came in. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>Back</span></span><span class=postbody>
in the driver's seat, she listened calmly as Eddie slapped the dashboard and
issued forth a storm of profanity. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Where the fuck were they!?" he finally demanded. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Could it have been a ruse?" she asked out loud. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"What!?" shouted Evil Eddie, and Agent Chin flinched
slightly. "I'm sorry," he said more calmly. "What?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She wished she hadn't spoken, but he'd become pissed again
if she didn't. "What if someone <span class=GramE>was wanting</span> to get into
your house while we were gone? To steal, plant a bug, or..." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Or worse," he said more calmly. "Yeah, I see what you're
saying." He pulled his cell phone out and hit a button. "Yeah," he said, "It
was a wash. Anyone try breaking in?" He listened a moment and then said, "I
want you to check around. <span class=GramE>Just one of you, but keep in touch.</span>
Something's fucked up." Then he hung up. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Chin knew he had only two people there. And could
they really be trusted? The adrenaline she was hooked on began pouring into her
system and she secretly relished it. Sneaking a glance at Evil Eddie beside
her, she asked, "Any word on the Rhodes boy?" FBI wanted to know where he was,
too. So far, all leads turned up nothing. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He snorted. "When I find him, he's dead. I haven't found
him yet." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>They were now on the final street. She slowed down so as
to casually pass the house and get a good look before pulling in. She wished
she could turn the music off, but Evil Eddie wouldn't like that. He loved his
metal. She had rolled her eyes when she found out he got his name because of
his earlier devotion to Iron Maiden. Being tall and gangly, at least in his
youth, with long, blond hair, he styled himself as "Eddie," an Iron Maiden logo
or mascot or whatever. His last name was Edwards, too, which must have helped. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>At least he wasn't such a metal head anymore, but he still
liked the music. Right now, <i>Forgive Me</i> by <span class=SpellE>Godsmack</span>
was on. If the FBI ever wanted information on heavy metal bands, past and
present, she could at least fill out pages and pages on THAT from the trivia
and songs she absorbed while working this case. She wondered how long this
discordant music would haunt her. It was often in her dreams now. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She slowed a bit more as she rounded the final bend, with
the stink of tobacco and gun oil filling the van, and <span class=SpellE>Godsmack</span>
blaring: </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>There's nothing to me now. An empty shell unfolded. </i></span><i><br>
<span class=postbody>How, when we learn to pray inside our demons are laughing </span><br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>How</span></span><span class=postbody>
long will this go on? Are we a bit much stronger? </span><br>
<span class=postbody>Do you think you can save me from living this way? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>I don't know how to love. I just know how to live. </span><br>
<span class=postbody>All I feel is hate. Will you forgive me? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>For all those things I've done, they keep on creeping by
me. </span><br>
<span class=postbody>And though we've changed our ways, </span><br>
<span class=postbody>still all our demons are laughing. </span><br>
<span class=postbody>How long will this go on? Aren't we a bit much stronger? </span><br>
<span class=postbody>I'd like to think you've came into my life to stay.</span></i><span
class=postbody> </span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>As she pulled up to Eddie's digs, she frowned in concern
as she saw a strange station wagon parked on their street. It appeared empty,
but no one should be parked there. She was as paranoid as Evil Eddie now, she
realized. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Call those guys again," she said. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Evil Eddie laughed a bit, but it was a bit forced. "You
really DO care for me, babe." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Stopping the van by their driveway, she yelled, "Call
them, <span class=SpellE>goddamnit</span>!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Okay, okay," he said, "but pull in the garage." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I'd rather you call them first," said Agent Chin. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I will, but I want my boys behind me with their hardware,
so pull into the goddamn garage!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Pursing her lips, she turned back to face the street and
hit the button that would open the gate and then the garage door. She drove
through warily and parked in the garage. The gate and garage door closed behind
them. Agent Chin opened her door and quickly got out, standing at ready, listening
for anything unusual. Everything seemed okay, except that Eddie slammed the
phone down. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Damn," he said in a low, intense voice, "if nothing's
wrong, I'm gonna kick the shit out of them." Then cocking his head back, he
yelled out, "There may be trouble. I want you ready." A few clicks of guns
being made ready answered him. Someone lit another cigarette. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Chin took a deep breath to steady <span class=GramE>herself</span>
and pulled her own gun, a <span class=SpellE>Glock</span> 20. Evil Eddie had
already pulled a .44 Magnum that he claimed his dad had given to him before he
got killed in a drug raid. It was his "lucky" gun, and the biggest mistake his
dad had made was <span class=GramE>give</span> away his lucky gun, for he died
almost right after. He found the gun reassuring whenever he had it on him or
needed a gun in hand. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>They were all out now, and coming quickly around. Evil
Eddie took the keys from Agent Chin and tossed them to a guy with long, brown
hair and a lit cigarette in his mouth. He motioned for him to open the door.
Then he grabbed Agent Chin's wrist and pulled her behind them, towards the back
of the van. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Even expecting trouble, Agent Chin was unprepared for the
deafening blast as the door opened. The guy who'd opened it flew back against
the van, blood pouring out of him, and she screamed. He was dead before he hit
the ground. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"SHIT!" yelled Evil Eddie, "CONTACT!" Seeing Agent Chin
staring in stunned horror at the corpse, he grabbed her just under the shoulder
and pulled her behind the van. Then he got on the ground and crawled underneath
the van. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Chin's professional training finally kicked in and
she took up a position, plotting her moves and her escape. She had no idea how
many there'd be inside, but she was sure there would be more than one. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>To her amazement, the other guys ran up to the door,
shooting in. The one with the AR-15 finally rolled on the ground, pointing the
rifle in and let out a burst. When no gunfire answered back right away, the
others ran in, guns blazing. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>IDIOTS!</i> <span class=GramE>she</span> thought, <i>Aim,
<span class=SpellE>goddamnit</span>! You're just wasting ammo!</i> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She had hardly finished the thought when she heard
different guns. <span class=GramE>A LOT of guns.</span> Her gut clenched in
terror, and then she aimed her <span class=SpellE>Glock</span> down as she felt
a hand pull at the bottom of her jeans. Evil Eddie had gotten the keys
apparently and handed them to her. "Get the van started!" he yelled. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She quickly jumped over to the button by the garage door
and pressed it, causing the door to begin opening. As it opened, she ran to the
other side of the van and opened the door. But as she was about to get in on
the shotgun side, she saw at least three people with long firearms running
towards the door leading into the garage and she jumped back out of the van,
accidentally dropping the keys to the floor, yelling, "Incoming!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Evil Eddie, still under the van, opened fired. It seemed
to stop them, but return fire did rip into the van. <i>No way! No fucking way!</i>
<span class=GramE>thought</span> Agent Chin, <i>Patterson can go fuck himself!</i>
Patterson was her dick of a boss. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She fled out the opened door, her <span class=SpellE>Glock</span>
held out in front of her as she scanned for enemies. She saw none, and heard
Evil Eddie continuing to fire. She ducked behind a tree and scanned the grounds
for any threat. No one, but that only made her more nervous. She had a hard
time believing these were amateurs. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>And then several seconds of silence.</span></span><span
class=postbody> They seemed to her as loud as the gun shots in the closed
garage had. She ran, tears falling. She knew Evil Eddie was out of ammo. She
was surprised and angry to find she really did care about him. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>As much as she hated doing it, she put her <span
class=SpellE>Glock</span> away for she would need both hands for what she was
about to do. Breaking into a mad run she made it to the fence in mere moments
and climbed over it, bruising herself only a little as she pulled herself over
and quickly dropped down. Then she pulled her <span class=SpellE>Glock</span>
again and looked all about her. <span class=GramE>No one in immediate sight.</span>
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She trotted down the street a little and pulled her cell
phone out. She stopped long enough to dial a number that she didn't dare keep
on autodial. She silently cursed as she heard the answering machine click on
with its ordinary sounding request for a message. <i>Why does he have to be in
the bathroom NOW?</i> <span class=GramE>she</span> wailed to herself.</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>While the machine droned on, she heard gunshots in the
garage and knew Evil Eddie was no more. The nearest house was a quarter of a
mile away and wouldn't be friendly to her. She heard a car starting from
somewhere not far behind her and she ran off the road, but found it difficult
to crawl through the barbed wire to get into the woods. She was still trying
when the car pulled up beside her and a man jumped out. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She instantly straightened and spun with her <span
class=SpellE>Glock</span> pointed at the man but held her fire. The man was
pointing his own gun at her, but she vaguely recognized the man and hoped for
salvation. She dropped her <span class=SpellE>Glock</span> and her cell phone
and got to her knees with her hands up. "I surrender!" she shouted. "Where are
the other cops?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He held a gun at her but didn't say anything. He squeezed
the trigger and Agent Chin felt shock, but surprisingly little pain, as her
right arm fell. <i>Getting shot in the chest right by your shoulder will do
that</i> she thought calmly, before she let herself drop to the ground. <i>Maybe
being down will calm the crazy-ass motherfucker!</i> <span class=GramE>she</span>
thought. She'd gotten used to the style of talk Evil Eddy used. She vaguely
wondered if Evil Eddie's ghost was at hand watching this, and if he now knew
she was FBI. If so, did he hate her? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She lay there motionless but terrified as the cop came up
to her. She heard the FBI answering machine hang up on her cell phone and knew
for the moment, she was truly alone. The cop grabbed her now useless arm and
pulled her over, stepping back and letting go. "I'm..." Before she could finish
telling him she was FBI, two quick gunshots silenced her forever. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The cop who killed Agent Chin made his call then to the
police station. He knew that anyone still in the home was dead or gone. The
assassins had strict orders to kill anyone of their own party who couldn't be
dragged away, and he didn't doubt that they would do it. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>They bothered even him. The Ice Cold truly made cold
motherfuckers who didn't fear anybody. He understood. He would himself kill a
friend if necessary. If Wild Card had given him orders to kill a fellow cop, he'd
have done it. But seeing the similarity between the Ice Cold killers and
himself disturbed him. They were killer animals, he was professional. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The Lawndale PD showed up in force not long after. With
all signs of regret he told them he'd had to shoot a female of Oriental descent
after she pulled a gun on him. Her gun lay beside her, where he left her for
homicide and internal affairs to look into. He was damn sorry that the others
got away. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>They told him he was lucky. Those people were crazed and
had A LOT of serious guns. The house was a mess. One of the new guys had thrown
up. It was his first time to see a dead person. He agreed that this had been a
bloody carnage, tough for a rookie. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Just as he was leaving, he saw Agent Fleming of the BATF
arrive. He hated that prick. It bothered him that he was as interested in Daria
Morgendorffer as Wild Card and <span class=SpellE>Dara</span> were. Strangely,
both Fleming and Wild Card had told him to leave the Morgendorffers alone, for
the time being. <span class=GramE>Particularly Daria.</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Was Fleming working for Wild Card, too? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>And <span class=SpellE>Dara</span>, who'd shot the cops
outside the Morgendorffer home, had also told him to back off. He owed that
crazy bitch. He hated the way she'd looked at him. And she'd dared to shoot his
cops. They had broken orders, but that was no excuse for the bitch to shoot
them. That was pure malice. All she'd had to do was get arrested and let him
get her out. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>As it was, she'd neutralized or alienated the few cops he
had managed to corrupt for Wild Card. The ones left weren't about to expose
themselves, but they were almost hostile to him now. All he had left to work
with were the idiots he manipulated. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>But that was okay, in the end. It was exciting to plan how
he would kill <span class=SpellE>Dara</span> and cover up his involvement in
it, or at least justify himself to Wild Card and/or the "proper" authorities.
An attitude like hers needed to be killed. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Lost in thought, about to drive away, he suddenly realized
Agent Fleming was staring at him coldly. He shook his head in disgust. He knew
with someone as high up as Fleming getting involved, their plans for two
Morgendorffer girls, Scott Rhodes, not to mention Jane Lane and that freakish
band, were going to have to be speeded up. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Heading back to the station, he sighed as he remembered
speaking to Jane Lane and the two Morgendorffer sisters at one time or another
since this unfortunate incident accidentally got started. He chuckled. Started,
and then someone decided to exploit it. Not the news crews, activists and
aspiring politicians, but the people that mattered. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He'd regret watching Quinn die. She was cute. He vaguely
wondered if he could spare her and how grateful she would be if he did. <span
class=SpellE><i>Naaa</i></span><i>, too much a liability</i>, he casually
decided, sealing her fate. And Jane... there was something about that girl that
he kind of liked. She reminded him of his own teen years, before everything
went bad. But he was already in too deep to get out now. The fact was<span
class=GramE>,</span> they all were going to have to be killed soon, possibly by
the same rabid dogs that just took out Evil Eddie. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He hoped that they would all see his face and know him for
the vile bastard he was, just before they died. He looked forward to "sorrowfully"
reporting their deaths to their respective parents. He got a thrill out of
affecting them so deeply and they'd never know that he had killed their kids. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The real thrill, though, was from the "<span class=SpellE>got'cha</span>"
moment. Like the gook bitch he'd just murdered, when she realized in the last
moment of her life that a cop was killing her and he'd get away with it. That
made up for the aggravation, like Fleming. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He loved the "<span class=SpellE>got'cha</span>" moments.
The innocent had the best expressions, not that anyone was truly innocent. He
suspected Jane and especially Quinn would make an expression that would amuse
him for years. He frowned as he thought about Daria. She would have that same
deadpan expression just before her head was blown off. Very little unnerved
him, but for some reason, that girl did. <i>I think I'll kill her myself with a
shotgun to the back of her head</i>, he thought, <i>just to make sure it's done
right.</i> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He'd better check up on Scott Rhodes, too. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>At the Morgendorffer residence, Daria and Quinn slept <span
class=GramE>on,</span> unaware that that one of Lawndale's finest was plotting
their untimely demise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=postbody>----------------------------------------- </span><br>
<span class=postbody>04/03/01 TUESDAY 3:00 PM </span><br>
<span class=postbody>------------------------------------------ </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn stared at the gun shoved in her face and tried not
to panic. <i>Everything's cool, calm down!</i>, she told herself, but she only
half believed it. She remembered what to do. Moving her head to the left, even
as she stepped to the left, she brought her left hand up in the opposite
direction and felt a hint of triumph as her hand caught the gun and twisted it
to point down. Her right hand lashed out at the gunman face, instead of his
neck as she felt like doing. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He tried pulling away, taking his gun with him. No way was
Quinn letting him do that. She brought her right hand down and grabbed the top
of the back of the gun, and twisted the gun down further and against the wrists
with both hands. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She instinctively avoided the ejection port when she did this.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The man had his head down and grabbed at his wrist. She
suppressed the urge to kick or knee him at several vulnerable points, and she
didn't turn the gun on him because she knew it was just a prop. The acting
injured was just a way of saying enough. It was used with newbies like her, as
well as to help instill confidence in the practitioner. Quinn sniffed a bit at
that. She saw the more advanced students spar, and she didn't see why she and
her family couldn't spar like that. It wasn't as if Scott was going go easy on
her! </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>I guess this stuff takes practice, too</i>, thought
Quinn, a little dismayed. But she had the power of the angels in her and she
was confident she could master this course in record time. But Quinn was a
little dismayed at just how easily a gun could be taken away. After all, that
meant <b>her</b> gun could be taken away, too. Scott had told her Matthew had
thought about becoming a police officer. Just how much more dangerous would he
have been with this kind of training? But at least, she reminded herself, now
she knew what to do if someone pointed a gun at her again. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Like the Wing Chun class, only a few of the people wore
uniforms. Most of the students wore athletic shoes and clothes, with black
sweat pants and karate pants being the most common leg wear. A few wore tees
for a <span class=SpellE>KML</span>. Nearly everyone wore <span class=SpellE>handwraps</span>
tight around their wrists, hands, and thumb, leaving the fingers out. Daria,
Quinn, and Helen had all been shown how to put these on, to protect the bones
and tendons in their hands. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria and Quinn both recognized a few police officers. And
at least a couple of them seemed to recognize them, but none made any attempt
to talk to them. Mrs. Jespersen, whom Helen had been referred to by Ms. <span
class=SpellE>Ribner</span>, was married to a Lawndale deputy. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>As they had been told, <span class=SpellE>Krav</span> <span
class=SpellE>Maga</span> was a brutal form of self-defense that dealt with how
to combat armed assailants, including those with firearms. A lot of the moves
looked as though they could work, at least against someone like Scott or
Matthew. But Quinn found herself doubting that everything she was witnessing
would work, especially against an experienced streetfighter. <span
class=SpellE>Krav</span> <span class=SpellE>Maga</span> had some dirty tricks,
but she found herself wishing to learn more of them, even though it would take
practice to use these few effectively. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Krav</span></span><span class=postbody>
<span class=SpellE>Maga</span> was also crueler than what <span class=SpellE>WSD</span>
Class had taught. Where Quinn had grabbed a thumb and twisted out of Scott's
grip when he grabbed her from behind, the instructors here had brutal tactics
of first ramming your fingers in the eyes of the guy behind you. <span
class=GramE>And a lot of aggressive strikes using fists, elbows, and feet.</span>
If Scott had tried what he did to her on these people, he'd probably have been
killed by their bare hands. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn saw Daria viewing the demonstrations with some
concern and wondered why this was bothering her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Oblivious to Quinn's scrutiny, Daria found her flesh
crawling as she not only noticed the inherent cruelty and aggression of <span
class=SpellE>Krav</span> <span class=SpellE>Maga</span>, but also recognized
the style. It was what that woman had used on Beavis and Butt-head before she
shot those two police officers. She found herself scanning the room to see if
she could find that blonde, even though she knew that was ridiculous. <i>Blondie
has to be several states away, if she's even still in the United States</i>,
Daria told herself. But could she learn to defend herself if this is what
potential assailants already knew to do? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria shook her head. <i>Matthew didn't know this. I'm
sure Scott doesn't know this stuff either. So how does Blondie mix in with the
likes of Matthew and Scott?</i> Her brows furrowed in thought, her lips pursing
in frustration at not being able to see a connection. Somehow, she doubted it
was sheer chance. There was a <span class=GramE>connection,</span> she just
didn't know enough to figure out what it was. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>After the hour-long session, Daria was exhausted. She
noticed that Helen was already sitting down, even sweatier than after the Wing
Chun class. Quinn was still eager, even perky. She was sweaty, but she didn't
care. That both heartened and disturbed Daria more than a little. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen was talking to someone, one of the instructors.
Helen beckoned her and Quinn over to them. Helen didn't seem fully recovered
from the workout, but she seemed less bothered about the entire thing than she
had before. "Come on, girls, Mrs. Jespersen is taking us to the shooting range."
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>A few minutes later and a few miles away at a nearby
shooting range, all three of them were getting introduced to various firearms.
Of course, Daria was familiar with this, but she still paid attention. She
noticed Mrs. Jespersen had a few different ways of handling weapons than her
last teacher. The instructors here also insisted on using eye and ear
protection, something her former instructor would've scoffed at. Now she
wondered why. <i>Of course, he knew I'd be acting in an emergency situation,
without any chance of special gear.</i> She'd have to compare and contrast and
see which one was right for her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Once again Daria found that the first lesson was "getting
rid of the flinch." Although she'd worked through it with her first shooting
instructor, after all that had happened recently, she was again flinching, just
a little. It was something none of them could help, Mrs. Jespersen explained.
That kind of power in your hands is scary. <i>But not as scary as this power in
the hands of the Matthew Fosters of the world, when I don't have an equalizer</i>,
Daria thought. And some guns were just so loud. Even though she thought she was
used to guns, firing a shotgun made such a loud noise that she almost cried
from it. She couldn't imagine what it was like for Quinn to have heard this
noise when it was aimed at her! </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>But Quinn didn't seem upset. Her little sister was picking
this up even faster than she had. She felt a twinge as she realized her
original instructor might've been more proud of Quinn, and pushed away the
unseemly jealousy. Overall, they were all in trouble, and the better off they
all were, the more likely they all would prevail. When vengeful drug dealers,
cops possessed of sinister purposes, strange women that came out of nowhere to
blow people away, and a friend of the would-be murderer Daria shot turning into
an armed desperado angry over the death of his friend, there wasn't room for a
weakest link. She didn't know if all this would do any good, but it was better
than doing nothing but worry. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>But having fired several "empties," and firing other shots
with live ammunition, they were getting over it completely. At least for the
time, Daria realized. The flinch was likely to come back for her mom and sister
if they didn't practice, practice, practice. But right now, Helen was the only
one who noticeably flinched at times. Daria and Quinn were both comfortable. It
just bothered Daria that her mom would almost certainly not allow them a gun,
but would keep one for herself. If she or Quinn ever did need someone with a
gun to come help, she hoped the person behind the gun wouldn't flinch. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria had told Quinn that there was more to firing a gun
than aiming and firing. It was true. Learning to shoot accurately took a lot of
practice. This is one reason why many criminals, and even plenty of police
officers, failed to hit what they were aiming at--and why accidental shootings
could be a problem if one weren't careful. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>On top of that, you had to watch for jerking, bucking, and
other instinctive responses people had when firing a gun, because that would
spoil your aim. There was also finding the best grip and various stances that
worked for each of them. Keeping your attention on the front sight and the
target, not to mention being mindful what was beyond the target you were
shooting at, was also something that took practice. Keeping your finger off the
trigger until you were ready to shoot was another, as was not pointing it--even
when you believed it empty--at anything you did not wish to destroy. It was an
exercise of mental skills as much as hand-eye coordination and inner
discipline. And with some of the guns they had test fired today, it was a
physical test in other ways, too. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen was encouraged by this course that made her familiar
with guns, but she was still torn inside about her attitude towards them. But
what really surprised her was that there were now pistols designed specifically
for women, and she said as much when they were through for the day. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mrs. Jespersen chuckled. "Oh, there are plenty of 'ladies
guns' now, Mrs. Morgendorffer. Shotguns, rifles, pistols, you name it." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen shook her head in wonderment. "I used to think I
should control other people's guns," said Helen, obviously tired. "But now I'm
wondering if I can control my own!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mrs. Jespersen casually replied, "You'll do well enough,
Mrs. Morgendorffer. Controlling other people's guns is not only a good idea,
but part of being a good neighbor." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"But so much hasn't worked out the way it was supposed to.
Yet I can't see just throwing up my hands and letting all this violent anarchy
take place, either!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The way to control other people's guns is by treating
them decent. The Ten Commandments can provide a good guideline to helping your
neighbors control their guns. But if they shoot anyway, then use what you learn
here and be damned glad you have the ability to return fire. That's another way
to control your neighbor's gun, too." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"It's just that we have police to handle these things." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yes, we do. But they can't be everywhere. And even police
at the station feel a need for a gun. Why not a homeowner who isn't surrounded
by police? Especially given how many died or were horribly harmed while waiting
for the police to show up, if they even had the ability to alert the police in
the first place." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"It still seems like violent anarchy," repeated Helen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mrs. Jespersen said "Consider two cases in Arizona. First
an unarmed woman was raped, shot and left for dead. The police showed up too
late to help her. Then the attacker forced his way into another private home.
In this one he was promptly shot and killed by a second woman with a handgun.
He will not rape again, nor will he murder anyone else. Episodes like this
happen around the country, but are totally ignored by the national media. Or
think about the Old West. Guns were everywhere. The violent areas were where a
bunch of young men, typically without families, got rich quickly at mining or
some similar trade and the criminals and vice peddlers came to ruin it for
everyone else. It wasn't the <span class=GramE>guns,</span> it was the
testosterone, the vice, and the money. And the most violent towns were those
with gun laws." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Be that as it may," said Helen, "I'm worried that I or
someone else may misuse a gun, or it will accidentally go off and hurt someone."
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I've heard of another instructor who said as a child he
feared his mom's sewing machine. He was scared it would just suddenly turn on
and sew through his hand. Once his mom showed him that the sewing machine was just
a tool that only works with human control, he lost his fear. He now tries to
help women overcome their fear of guns the same way his mom helped him to
overcome his fear of a sewing machine. It's not something to fear, though it's
not something you should use without learning how." She shrugged. "But you don't
want the wrong hands to get a hold of it, especially small children who find
things like guns fascinating. There are things to help with that, but best
thing of all is not to show off your guns in a rooster-like display. But most
women have more sense than that." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen smiled tiredly. "Someone should tell the NRA that.
The NRA was a bit... demeaning toward us. Although there was a woman with them,
and she sounded like she had some sense." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I'd say she felt her fellows weren't entirely
housebroken," added Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yeah, the NRA can be a bit confusing at times. And yes,
there are some sexist members in it, though I wouldn't call '<span
class=SpellE>em</span> sexist as a whole. Some are even feminists. And you
really should take their courses, Mrs. Morgendorffer. There are a lot of good
people and good instructors in the NRA, too. And they can give you a more
comprehensive explanation, demonstration, and coaching about the various types
of ammo, about getting a license for concealed handgun permit, shooting,
cleaning your gun, safely storing it and more than I can show you on this one
day. These are things you should know if you're going to have a gun. Most
people who accidentally shoot themselves or someone else were the same people
who skipped learning about their guns." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You mean even a woman like me?" asked Helen sardonically.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mrs. Jespersen shook her head. "They're not all that bad,
Mrs. Morgendorffer, and I've been around enough to know. You just got some bad
apples and unfortunately, the bad apples love getting attention so they had to
make themselves known in this case. And I challenge you to find someone more
sexist than someone who says we should not--even cannot--defend ourselves, or our
home and family. That we must wait for a man to come save us. That we are so
stupid and incompetent that self-defense is something we cannot concern
ourselves with because it is something impossible to us. Especially," she added
bitterly, "when it sinks to a point that we are advised to beg a rapist to use
a condom. Particularly since cases of rape have been thrown out of court as
such a request doesn't make it seem like rape." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Wouldn't it lead to anarchy?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"To me, anarchy is a society in which criminals act
unimpeded, and that kind of negative anarchy shows its face in areas where the
law-abiding are disarmed, whether or not the criminals themselves are." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"But how can people having guns stop that? Won't the
criminals just pull out an Uzi?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mrs. Jespersen shook her head. "Have you heard of Dr. G. <span
class=SpellE>Kleck</span>?" When Helen shook her head, she said, "He calls
himself a liberal, a member of the ACLU, a member of Amnesty International, and
refuses to have anything to do with the NRA. Yet in his respected studies, he
found gun control created more violence than it stopped. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"As just one example, he cites how the city of Orlando,
Florida, was going into a panic over several rapes, and so the police taught a
gun safety course for women. Something like a thousand women showed up, as
opposed to the expected 50 or so. Having a gleeful media cover this, which
showed women learning to shoot and the police supporting them, the men of the
city found a new hobby. The rapes dropped by nearly 90% and stayed down. In
contrast, the rest of Florida, which did no such thing, continued to experience
high crime and violence. The Orlando PD teaching women to shoot is the only
known significant difference." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen blinked several times. "How come this isn't reported
today?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mrs. Jespersen shook her head in disgust. "You can't tell
me that most of the people in Handgun Control Inc. and similar groups aren't
bad guys. The only reason someone wants to disarm a law abiding citizen is to
do something so nasty to them that they fear to do it while said person can shoot
back. That goes for politicians as well as rapists." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen seriously doubted that assertion was true. But she
hated seeing how she was empowering criminals, not to mention turning people
who really weren't bad into criminals. Her intention had been to encourage a
kinder, gentler nation where guns weren't in easy reach, and therefore people
would think of other ways to solve their problems. She wasn't ready to accept
that she had been making things more violent, not less. There were enough other
factors besides <span class=GramE>herself</span> at work. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>Maybe there really should be some common sense gun
control</i>, she mused, <i>but so far we've had the gun control without the
common sense.</i> She thought of her experiences of road rage, having been on
both ends of it, and suppressed a shiver at the thought of guns entering the
equation. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Speaking of sexist, did you hear what Mayor <span
class=SpellE>Codey</span> said over in Middleton recently?" asked Mrs.
Jespersen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No," said Helen, curious. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"He said only policemen should have the right to decide to
use a gun, because we don't have the training. But I've trained for years and
have trained others on the legal and practical use of firearms. And like many
men, he thinks the only way to prevail is to have a bigger gun than an
attacker. He doesn't understand that a .38 works well enough, even if your
attacker has an Uzi. Besides, most rapists and stalkers strangle or stab their
victims to death, not shoot them." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"He sounds more ignorant than sexist," replied Helen. She
couldn't help but contrast Mayor <span class=SpellE>Codey</span> with the cops
that helped women to learn to shoot, and the resulting rapes going down. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"But he gets much worse than that. He's the type of
bastard that would take the gun away from a woman facing down a rapist and then
mock her when she protests. Of course he has the same women he mocks pay for
his personal bodyguards, protection, and fine living." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yes, many politicians aren't very nice," said Helen, "but
is that all there is to his sexism?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mrs. Jespersen snorted. "He refers to facing off against rape,
sodomy, and murder as a 'dispute.' He bluntly said that women should have the
sense to walk in large groups and stay in well lit areas." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The bastard!" shouted Helen sincerely. "Has he passed a
bill advocating we wear <span class=SpellE>burkas</span> and never leave our
home without a male chaperone, too?" Just because she might agree with Mayor <span
class=SpellE>Codey's</span> stance on gun ownership didn't mean she'd put up
with statements like that. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mrs. Jespersen shook her head. <span class=GramE>"Nope.</span>
And he refused to respond when some of us publicly asked him if he knew that
most of us are attacked in either our homes or in populated areas with a lot of
people around. Nor did he answer what we should do if we're getting off at work
at midnight. He did say he supported more cops on the streets, but he just did
the budget where he cut a lot of that." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"But he didn't cut his personal security that the rest of
us pay for, did he?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You know it," replied Mrs. Jespersen. "In any case, the
police have the training to take care of themselves. And I bet you'd get a rude
answer if you demanded they do their job for a month without having a firearm
in reach. But police aren't <span class=GramE>superhuman,</span> they're just
armed, and trained to take care of themselves. You can have that training and
that weaponry, too." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"What do the criminologists say?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mrs. Jespersen shrugged. "They're individuals like anyone
else, with a variety of interpretations and opinions. But more and more of them
are turning away from the antigun position because felons can still get guns,
and crime only goes up where gun control measures succeed. It's clearer than
ever that in areas with less gun <span class=GramE>control,</span> guns are
used in self defense more than in crime. Often just by brandishing one, or by
making would-be assailants unsure of their targets. That is, they're not even
fired and they prevent more crime than they inspire. And statistically,
something like 200,000 women <span class=GramE>have</span> used guns to defend
themselves from those attempting to sexually abuse them. Given that, who do you
think wants to disarm you?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen swallowed self-consciously. "But what about shooting
the wrong person? Don't police have special training to keep them from doing
that, while the rest of us just muddle along? Sometimes, fatally?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Actually," said Mrs. Jespersen, "civilians could get the
same training at places like Thunder Ranch. However, since the police are five
times more likely to shoot someone in a case of mistaken identity than
civilians, maybe we shouldn't. No one I know of has ever shot someone in the
back 40 times while he ran away." Her tone was wryly amused. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen almost said something about that being caused by
police having more access and liberty to use guns but didn't. She couldn't see
how that mattered. She wanted to disarm people who would use those guns to hurt
others, not people who would use guns to defend themselves. She was more
confused than ever on this subject. Guns seemed so violent, and yet it looked
as if they prevented violence. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>But there were so many other factors to consider as well,
such as availability to burglars, criminals that were more inclined to shoot
first and ask if their victim was carrying later, and moments of poor impulse
control among normally law abiding people. A gun could seem to offer a simple
solution in a moment of rage or despair that would pass if a gun wasn't right
in reach. And Scott was out there right now with a .38 revolver taken from his
grandmother who had lawfully owned it. That legal gun would now be used in
crimes, possibly even in the murder of one or both her daughters. This would
bear thinking about at a later time. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Look up Paxton Quigley," added Mrs. Jespersen. "She used
to be with Handgun Control Inc. before reality hit her upside the head. Tom
Brokaw even called her the self-defense guru of 15 million women, though Sarah
Brady calls her a traitor that causes needless death." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yes," said Helen, "we met some people from Handgun
Control Inc, too. I'm not sure which I found more... trying on my patience." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"In all honesty, Mrs. Morgendorffer, I don't envy you your
situation at all. Not only is your family in danger, but the political forces
around you are perhaps even more dangerous and volatile than the criminal
forces." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>By that time, the flinch was gone from Helen. <span
class=GramE>And with it, the fear of guns.</span> She still respected them, and
she wasn't sure where she stood on the issue anymore, but one thing she did
know: She was getting a gun. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>But she still didn't want Jake or her two daughters
getting their hands on one. <i>At least until after this legal and media circus
is over with</i>, thought Helen to herself. Even so, she couldn't help but feel
a sense of pride and accomplishment at having learned to shoot, and seeing
Daria and Quinn both shoot so well. They both even out shot her. But she
decided that as good as they both were<span class=GramE>,</span> both were still
too young and inexperienced to have a gun themselves. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>But she wasn't. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen was glad Quinn was chattering away in the ride home,
for she thought it was a good sign that Quinn was dealing with the situation at
hand far better than she had been when she hid away in her room all the time. "Did
you see the bullet jewelry in her Ballistic Fashions catalogue?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria refrained from snorting, but the idea of the Fashion
Club wearing bullets was making it difficult. "Careful," she said, "you wouldn't
want to give anyone ideas on where a bullet should go." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn laughed at that, surprising Daria. "What I really
liked," added Quinn, "were those black leather outfits and holsters put out by
Under Cover Comfort. Some of the tattoos that the models wore were nice, too. I
didn't know models could HAVE tattoos." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Quinn," warned Helen, "I MIGHT get you a gun but don't
even THINK of getting a tattoo!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn smiled, suddenly realizing new fodder for leverage
in negotiations with her mom. "They have a bunch of accessories anyway," said
Quinn. "So you can look good as well as dangerous." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Quinn," added Helen, "the point of having a gun is not to
look dangerous. It's to defend yourself if you ever need to." Helen blinked as
she remembered how Quinn got Scott's gun away. "Quinn, what would you have done
if you'd had a gun when Scott pulled a gun on you?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn blinked herself. She hadn't thought about that. "I...
I don't know." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Would you have gone for your own gun?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Probably," said Quinn. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"And how do you think that night would have ended if you
had?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn was silent, lost in thought on the rest of the way
home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=postbody>------------------------------------------- </span><br>
<span class=postbody>04/05/01 THURSDAY 4:20 P.M. </span><br>
<span class=postbody>-------------------------------------------- </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen was hyped up in her power suit, marching around
nervously, giving orders to all. <span class=GramE>Especially to Jake.</span> "Don't
forget the lasagna." Helen regretted that she would miss supper with her family
over this. But if it helped Daria and Quinn then it was worth it. "You know
where your cell phone is?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jake was nodding and agreeing to it all, trying to hide
his irritation. He knew this was important. Helen and Ms. Morrison were going
in to see Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>, who had even said there was
a possibility of dropping some or all the charges against one or both of his girls.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>It was completely unexpected, and it was obvious he wanted
something, but Helen couldn't figure out what, and that made her very nervous.
But even being in the dark, she couldn't afford to let this opportunity pass.
If nothing else, maybe they could find out what made him so eager to make a
deal. Nothing his office had sent her had been particularly bad for <span
class=GramE>himself</span>, although based on it, Helen was fairly convinced
she could get some charges dismissed. It was, she told herself, possible <span
class=SpellE>Fillman</span> realized just how much she and the DA knew and
wanted to ensure that some facts never came to light. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Coming into the living room where Daria and Quinn were
watching TV, Helen reminded them, "You are not to leave this house. <span
class=GramE>Either one of you!"</span> She was even <span class=GramE>more
tense</span> after hearing of several drug dealers being killed recently. <span
class=GramE>None of the dead including Scott Rhodes.</span> <i>Unfortunately</i>,
she thought with bitterness. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Sure, Mom," replied Quinn a little nervously and a little
irritated. This was too much like being grounded, and she wasn't the one who
had done anything! <i>Well, not too much anyway</i>, Quinn added silently to
herself. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Oh, my god, I'm going to be late! See you later. Don't
call unless it's an emergency! Bye!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>A few short moments later, and Helen was pulling out of
the driveway. Daria let out a breath that she had been holding without
realizing it. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Okay," said Daria. "You were saying this show is useful
because?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Because it helps coordinate your wardrobe. Maybe it's
shallow, but many people judge others based on how they dress, and it's dumb to
not at least consider it. Especially if those people are going to decide if you
go to prison or not." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Okay," said Daria crossing her arms. "So if I want to be
judged a puppet of this <span class=GramE>show's sponsors</span>, then I demand
Mom and Dad buy me whatever it is they say I need?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn frowned. "It's not completely like that, Daria."
Then she smiled thinly. "Though it's mostly like that. But there are some real
color patterns that not even Cashman's can manipulate, and you really ought to
learn at least that much!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria shook her head, her arms still crossed. "I don't
know. This show makes me feel sleepy. Are you sure there aren't some <span
class=SpellE>subliminals</span> in this telling me I feel sleepy?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"As if! You can't look good if you look tired, and they
want their audience to look good watching them. Besides, you might fall asleep
and miss their promos." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"They'd rather have a look of vapid but genuine
excitement?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"<span class=SpellE>Doh</span>!" said Quinn. "Like why
give out freebies at the end of presentations or prizes during a show? To keep
you interested and paying attention." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Good dogs get the Scooby snack." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Oh, nothing to make you fat, Daria." Quinn seemed to
think Daria was being ridiculous. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"How about this," offered Daria. "Turn off the TV and you
tell me what the basics are. Then I can see how much value there is in this.
Okay?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn thought about it a moment and nodded. Turning off
the TV, she ran a look over Daria that reminded Daria of Jane sizing up a new
artistic inspiration. "First," started Quinn, "you should get a different
jacket. Green is good for a sallow complexion and hair that is almost reddish,
but you need a different design and length." Quinn carelessly ran her own
fingers through her own hair as she said the last. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Sallow?" asked Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Green compliments your hair and eyes, Daria," said Quinn,
"but the shape is all wrong, and the hue could be better. Marcus has an awesome
green blouse..." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Wait a minute," said Daria frowning, "what's wrong with
my jacket?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Daria," said Quinn exasperated, "your jacket makes you
look top-heavy!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Top heavy?" asked Daria blinking. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Your jacket is too long. It makes your legs look short
and upper-body look top-heavy." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria sighed, but surprised Quinn by asking, "Well, if you
were me, what would you wear?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Hmm," said Quinn, excited by her sister finally asking
HER something in a way that said she was finally respecting her views. "I think
if I were you, I'd start off with a jade colored Marcus jacket and skirt with a
short sleeved mock turtleneck, maybe a pale gold." Tilting her head lightly,
she added, "Replace those Docs with some shoes, or even some Birkenstocks. You
could even wear some brightly colored shoes, but if you do, you'll need a scarf
or something of the same color to match them, unless the shoes go with the
outfit. I think hippie chic is coming back into vogue, and that just might help
you with the jurors. And I think maybe some dark peach or russet rouge for your
cheeks along with some orange or mocha lipstick..." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Lipstick comes in those colors?" asked Daria bemused. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>"Of course, Daria.</span></span><span
class=postbody> Well, it's not pumpkin-orange, if that's what you're worried
about. It's more brown or copper-colored depending on the brand. Now don't ruin
my concentration. Okay, we'll start with neutral colors at first, to compliment
your jade suit. Those are safe. We can add colors later as we see which colors
work best for you and what kind of clothes we'll finally settle on getting for
you. Your skirt or dress should have another layer of fabric in it to add some
body to your flat derriere and, hey where are you going!?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"To my room!" said Daria marching off, "leave me and my
flat derriere alone!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Daria," said Quinn following a little way behind her,
surprised that her sister wasn't being coldly logical about this and thus
seeing the reasonability of her pointers, "I'm only trying to help!" She
stopped at the foot of the stairs and waited until she heard Daria's door slam
shut. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn sighed, heading back to the couch. She didn't feel
like turning the TV on. Why couldn't Daria see that she had only been trying to
help? <i>And find out <span class=GramE>who</span> I am,</i> thought Quinn
glumly. <i>Am I Quinn Morgendorffer, Vice President of the Fashion Club, or
Quinn Morgendorffer, wannabe Lawndale Virginia Underground Streetfighter
Champion? They both have kinda a nice ring to them.</i> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Instead of watching her show, she switched over to MTV
instead. There was some retro video just coming on that she decided to watch
since this was the first time in months she turned to it and the first thing
she saw wasn't a commercial. Besides, it appealed to her in a melancholy way. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>The heat of the sun </i></span><i><br>
<span class=postbody>Was a little too much today </span><br>
<span class=postbody>Love on the wing </span><br>
<span class=postbody>Flew so high it just melted away </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>So sweet on the run </span><br>
<span class=postbody>So little time to make you see </span><br>
<span class=postbody>What can't be undone </span><br>

<br>
<span class=postbody>But sometimes a fool </span><br>
<span class=postbody>Gets lucky and wins </span><br>
<span class=postbody>Sometimes the innocent pay </span><br>
<span class=postbody>For an old man's sin...</span></i><span class=postbody> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She perked up just a bit as the phone rang. "Hello?" she
asked. She frowned as a voice asked for a Mr. Morgendorffer. "Daddy!" she
yelled. "It's for you!" When she didn't get an answer, she went into the
kitchen to find him grumbling over a note that her mom had written. "Dad, you
got a phone call," she said. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Oh, thanks, honey," said Jake smiling. "I'll get it in
here." He picked up the kitchen phone and Quinn went back to the living room to
catch the name of the video. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>But when the tears are dark </i></span><i><br>
<span class=postbody>And we stand as one </span><br>
<span class=postbody>All I wanna feel </span><br>
<span class=postbody>And when the amber light </span><br>
<span class=postbody>Of daylight's gone </span><br>
<span class=postbody>All I wanna hear </span><br>
<span class=postbody>Is the beat of a heart </span><br>
<span class=postbody>The beat of a heart </span><br>
<span class=postbody>You come and take me far away</span></i><span
class=postbody> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>It was definitely 80s. She saw it was <i>Beat of a Heart</i>
by <b>Scandal</b>. She never heard of them before, but it somehow managed to
catch her mood at the moment. Yet she couldn't really say what it was about. <i>Maybe
it meant something in the 80s</i>, she thought to herself. Shrugging to
herself, she got up to get a diet coke. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Upstairs, Daria wondered why she had gotten so mad. She
wasn't mad at Quinn, and she should've expected that her sister would advise
her on clothes. She had been seriously trying to help, and Daria didn't doubt
that Quinn gave herself much the same instructions. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She also wondered what game <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>
was playing now. No way <span class=GramE>he was</span> having second thoughts.
Something was up. <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> wasn't even doing this out
of misguided idiocy, the way most people did. His ill will was born of malice
and opportunism. She hated him and knew he could destroy her, and would, if it
advanced his own career. It also sounded as if there was an old grudge against
her mom there. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She was also having second thoughts about running. Jane
hadn't gotten in touch with her yet, but no doubt she was being very careful
about contacting her gun dealer. <i>If I run</i>, Daria thought morosely, <i>Mom
and Dad lose the bond on me, which probably means they lose the house</i>. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>It was a moral dilemma. She didn't want to run, but what
choice did she have. <i>I hope Mom can work out a deal with <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span></i>,
but Daria felt that such a deal would never happen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Sighing, she put on her Judas Priest CD. Well, Trent's CD
that he gave her once as a keepsake. She really should slip that back into his
collection. But she had it now and she was strangely in the mood to hear <i>Bloodsuckers</i>
by JP. She put it on and made a silent wish that this time Beavis and Butt-head
didn't burst into her room again in search of it. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>Don't speak to me of morality </i></span><i><br>
<span class=postbody>Justice wrong or right </span><br>
<span class=postbody>You dig the dirt ignore the hurt </span><br>
<span class=postbody>And spit out all your lies </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Conscience free as we bleed </span><br>
<span class=postbody>Hypocrisy born from greed </span><br>
<span class=postbody>Don't preach to me of integrity </span><br>

<span class=postbody>The judge's thrilled </span><br>
<span class=postbody>He's dressed to kill </span><br>

class=postbody> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The music grated on her nerves, but she was living the
subject of the song, and she had no choice but to deal with that. This music
was a beacon that shared her frustration with the justice system. Especially
circus trials like her own. The system sucked. She wished she could believe
otherwise, but she had no reason to. And she had seen <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>.
Unless there was blackmail involved, there was no way <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>
was going to let go of her, at least not without putting up a fight. So what
was his angle in this deal with her mom? </span><br>

<br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria frowned and looked at the door. For some reason, she
had a strong sense of deja vu. She could almost feel Jane there, even though
she wasn't, and that Beavis and Butt-head were about to barge in again. And
then her door opened, and she started as her dad came in. Daria quickly turned
the CD off. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Daria, honey," said Jake, "I'm going to see a Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Weisal</span> down at the county recorder's office. <span
class=GramE>He's needing</span> someone to show him the property deeds and I'm
the first one who was home! If he's the big shot he claims he is, I could make
a fortune off this!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"If he's a big shot," stated Daria, "wouldn't you already
know him?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Not necessarily," said Jake, almost sounding sly to
Daria. "And even if he's not, he could become one. And he said he would keep
the jerks at the county recording office open awhile longer, so he must have
SOME clout. I sure couldn't do that!" He smiled a bit apologetically as he
added, "And we really need the money you know." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yeah," said Daria, "I've noticed you haven't been working
much lately." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jake frowned. "True, everyone seems to think I'm a risk
right <span class=GramE>now,</span> or too distracted. I still have a couple of
clients, but I think they're looking for someone to replace me." Jake's voice
suddenly sounded angry and bitter. "I'd like to see how they would pay for
their family's legal bills when no one will hire them!" He blinked as he saw
Daria frown in what looked like genuine regret. "Hey, it's not your fault,
kiddo." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria swallowed. <i>Yeah, <span class=GramE>Dad,</span>
thanks for making it even harder for me to run.</i> "So, um, this could be a
good deal, huh?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jake nodded avidly. "Sure could. I can't afford to let
this pass. But I got to hurry! The county recording office will close in just a
few minutes! You look after Quinn, okay?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Um, okay," said Daria. "Don't you think you should call
Mom, first?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Helen? Why would I do that?" asked Jake, sounding a
little defensive. "She said only in an emergency. This isn't an emergency. And
I need to leave now, '<span class=GramE>cause</span> I'm sure he won't be able
to keep them open for much longer. It's almost closing time! You're here, Quinn
seems more okay now, and there are two cops right outside. What could go wrong?"
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria bit her lip, and then told herself to stop being
ridiculous. "Okay," she said, "I'll try holding down the fort for you." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"That's my girl!" said Jake proudly. "I should only be
gone for a few minutes. Hang in there!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yeah, that's what I'll do," said Daria blithely. "Hang." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jake frowned a bit, feeling that there was a hidden
meaning in her words but he couldn't find it. He put his hand up in a departure
gesture and left, leaving her door open. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>After hearing her dad leave the house, she got up and
closed the door. <i>Quinn can take care of herself</i>, thought Daria, and
noted with a little surprise that she believed it. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Downstairs, Quinn had finally turned the TV on, but was
going through the channels listlessly now, still in thought. She hoped to find
something distracting, but a show on fashion just wasn't going to do that. She <span
class=GramE>frowned</span> a bit as she heard a knock on the door and wondered
what her dad forgot. He hadn't even been gone for more than three minutes. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She went up to the door and opened it casually. Her face
betrayed doubt as she saw several young men, college-aged, and somewhat
scraggly. They must be here for Daria. "Oh," she said in surprise, "are you
with that band?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>They surged forward. Too late, Quinn tried to close the
door, but they shoved it open and two men grabbed her, one on each side. They
pulled her in and the others ran in, one closing the door behind them. There
were six of them, Quinn noted. And every single one of them was bigger than
her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"What are you doing!?" shrieked Quinn in surprise. They
couldn't be friends of Scott or <span class=GramE>Matthew,</span> they were
dressed too trashy, and were too old for them. But she was still scared and
wondered if they got their drugs from Scott. <i>Or were the ones who shot up
those meth dealers we heard about on the news.</i> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Shut up," said one holding her left arm calmly but
intensely. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Another one came forward and spoke in a low voice. "Where's
Daria?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn steeled herself and said nothing, glaring defiance.
She toppled a bit as his fist suddenly crashed into her jaw. And it hurt!
Bastard had even hit her where she still had a bruise and she knew he knew it.
She knew she was going to be tasting blood soon. She tried to talk but found
she couldn't get her jaw to move right. "Uh, uh, uh..." she gasped out. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Upstairs?" the man who punched her had asked. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She hadn't meant to say that, but it was logical, and she
didn't want to be hit again. Beginning to cry softly, she nodded her head,
feeling low. She wanted to cry out to warn Daria, but it wouldn't do any good.
And right now she didn't think she could scream anyway. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"We'll be right back," said the man who had punched her to
the ones holding Quinn. "Keep her quiet." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I hear Daria is dangerous," said the one who had told
Quinn to shut up. "Careful. She might kick your ass." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I'm not scared of her." He frowned as he saw blood on
Quinn's lip. "Make sure she doesn't bleed on anything," he added before he went
to the stairs, three other men behind him. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The man on Quinn's right pulled out a bandanna and put it
in her hand. He adjusted his grip to lock her arm loosely above her elbow. "Use
that to stop the bleeding," he stated. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"<span class=SpellE>Ewww</span>!" said Quinn forgetting
herself. "This is filthy!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Put it in your mouth now, bitch, or I will." There was no
passion there, other than slight exasperation. <span class=GramE>Just a man
giving her the facts.</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn blinked and then realized something. She was getting
angry. She was still scared, but her fear was changing inside her, transforming
her. She suddenly remembered that she had the power of Buffy within her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She dropped the bandanna. "Oh, no," she cried in distress,
"now it's even more dirty!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"And it's going in your mouth," the guy said, a bit of
anger in his voice. Quinn bit her lip as she heard Daria's voice upstairs
talking loudly. Quinn couldn't hear what she was saying. Her fear continued to
morph into anger. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Still holding on to her with one hand, the guy bent down
to get the bandanna. And then Quinn kneed him in the face, knocking him off
balance, as she pulled out of the grip of the other guy who was too surprised
by this to hang on. He lost what little grip he had when Quinn drove two
fingers into his throat. He threw a punch at her, but Quinn easily dodged it
and kicked his knee, followed by an open palm to the face. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She jumped out of the way of the other guy who was now
lunging at her, but he still managed to strike her enough to cause her to fall
back. She rolled and started to come back up when he kicked at her. She blocked
with her two forearms, catching and turning his leg as she had been taught. A
split-second later another kick and she blocked the same way. <i>Third move
MUST be a strike!</i> <span class=GramE>said</span> a voice in her head. With a
cry, she lashed out, her vertical fist shattering his nose. Amazingly, he did
not fall or even fall back. He reeled but glared at her with a sheer rage. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn's momentary discomfort at his refusal to fall
quickly fueled her own rage and she struck again, moving forward and then
kicking the back of his knee. He wobbled then, nearly falling and she kicked
the side of his leg. He fell to his knees, shrieking in rage and pain, and
Quinn followed with a kick to his head. After his head bashed off the lamp
stand, knocking the lamp onto the floor, Quinn kicked his head again. Again it
crashed into the lamp stand and then he was down, barely conscious. If they
didn't want to leave any blood in the house, they were now SOL. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn felt some of her air knocked out of her as the other
guy crashed into her. She fell rolling and the one who had tackled her was on
the ground but not on top of her. He was fast in regaining his feet and lunging
at Quinn, but not fast enough. Quinn was already on her feet and centered as
his lead hand grasped at her. She grabbed his pinkie, similar to the way she
had grabbed Scott's index finger not too long ago, and twisted, moving around
him. This time, she knew other dirty tricks to use and she showed him one now:
twisting his arm back in her grasp, she screamed her rage as she brought the
back of her curved elbow into the back of his elbow. He screamed too, and Quinn
knew she had at least fractured his finger, if not his arm. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Unbelievably, he faced the pain and started to twist and
turn to get at her. Quinn moved with him and kicked him in the back of the knee
while pulling him back, causing him to fall back with his arm twisting at an
unnatural angle. Quinn kicked his twisted arm and he let out a huge shriek then
as his head pushed backwards exposing his throat. Screaming again, Quinn
brought her foot down on his throat. The strength went out of him then as he
devoted all his energy to coughing. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn jumped back, knowing he was out of the fight. The guy
she had just knocked unconscious was starting to stir, and Quinn kicked him in
the jaw before jumping back and facing the other four who were coming down the
stairs with Daria. The guy she'd just kicked stopped struggling to come to. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>Yes!</i>, Quinn cheered silently as she turned,
adrenaline singing through her veins to deal with the others. She was only
slightly dismayed as she saw Daria meekly complying but looking at her in
shock. Everyone else was blinking at her in stunned disbelief, too. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The man who had punched her earlier pulled a mean-looking
pistol out and aimed it at her. Quinn ducked, rolled and considered her
options. That gun was a problem, and it changed the equation too much. She was
sure she could handle this if she were armed, but unarmed she wasn't at all
sure. She could get the gun away from him if she were close, but only if she
had surprise. Would anything she did surprise them now? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"NO!" shouted one of the men. "She lives!" He turned to
her, his hands held out as if to hold her at bay. "We don't want to hurt you or
your sister. Just talk." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Talk then," commanded Quinn. Silently, she pleaded for
Daria to fight, to get the gun. She wasn't really close enough, but she was
much closer than Quinn. She was ready to demand their attention so Daria could
get the gun easier if only Daria would do something! </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Not here," the man who had punched her growled. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Here," said Quinn firmly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>His eyes flared in sudden rage. "Bitch," he spat, "I could
easily have your leg blown off. Would you like that bitch? But then we'd have
to carry you and you'd bleed all over our car. You might not even make it to
where we need to go. Now come on, and I'm even willing to overlook your beating
the shit out of Thumper and Blade." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>His voice showed that even acknowledging she had done this
was outside his realm of experience. <i>I guess fashionable middle-class teens
are supposed to be weak and helpless</i>, sniffed Quinn silently. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Come on," he said. "Let's go. <span class=GramE>Now."</span>
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>Daria, get the gun!</i> Quinn pleaded silently. Daria
had also had the same training, and she kept a cool head. But Daria looked as
lost as the night Matthew had shoved his gun in her face at the Zen. Quinn
suddenly felt herself losing a bit of her confidence, and she became aware that
where she had been hit was starting to hurt. And she still wasn't completely
healed up from the last beating she took. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>"Where?"</span></span><span
class=postbody> Quinn asked, a little of her spirit dampened. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The guy who punched her seemed encourage by the crack in
her veneer. <span class=GramE>"In the car."</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>When Quinn saw Daria nod, she crossed her arms and said, "Okay.
But I walk without being carried. And so does Daria." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The man blinked at that. Finally he glared but nodded. "Okay,
as long as you walk and don't try to run. But I've had enough of your bullshit!"
He put his gun under his belt as he glared daggers at Quinn, keeping his hand
close to his gun. Quinn went to the door as the two men she had beaten had
started getting up, cussing, one of them still coughing and choking. The guy
who had punched her laughed at that, mocking them all. They released Daria and
she was soon by Quinn. And some of the guys were right behind them both. The
others were coming closer. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>But outside, Daria suddenly stopped. "Quinn, where are the
police?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn stopped herself and looked around. For the first
time in several days she didn't see a car there. <span class=GramE>Ever since
the shooting there had been someone there almost 24/7.</span> And the last few
days their home had been frequently passed by squad cars, too. But now the
street was empty, except for an old Cadillac of some kind. The gray, dismal day
of dark clouds kept most people from being outside or even looking out their
windows. It was just too depressing. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No more bullshit," said the guy menacingly behind them. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Right," said Daria, and grabbed Quinn's arm. "Run, Quinn!"
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>Neither one of them got more than a
step.</span></span><span class=postbody> Daria feared being beaten to a pulp,
but if it happened, she hoped someone saw and called the police, or the cops
would return. It was almost time for people to start driving by on their way
home, too. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>But they were both simply dragged to the back of the
Cadillac with no sign of help. Three made sure Quinn was off balance the entire
time, and an arm around her throat kept her from screaming. One opened the
trunk and looked around. "Okay, put them in." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Both were unceremoniously shoved into the trunk and the
hatch closed. Both girls kept low to avoid being hit in the head, and then
suddenly knew a new kind of fear as they realized they were trapped in tight
confines together. Quinn found herself afraid all over again as they both lay
gasping and the car started up. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Then they heard another car, and it seemed to pause. "Is
that the cops?" asked Quinn. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I hope so," said Daria. <i>And I hope it's NOT Mom or Dad</i>,
she thought to herself. Then there was a pounding on the trunk and muffled
curses, and the two girls lay terrified at the rage they sensed above them,
wondering if they were about to be shot through the trunk. Then it stopped,
they heard the car doors all close and then the car was moving away. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Daria," asked Quinn, "what are we going to do?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Feel around the bottom. I want to get the jack if they
have one." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Good idea!" said Quinn, suddenly hopeful again. "You hit
the guy with the gun and then hold the rest off while I get his gun from him!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Um, no," said Daria. "But if it comes to that, YOU hit
them. You're so much better than I am at that." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn felt some small pleasure at the admission, but the
gravity of their situation didn't allow her to enjoy it as much as she might. "Then
what?" she asked, as she felt at what could around her. She was confident Daria
had a plan. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Well," Daria began, then stopped and said, "help me! I
found it!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Soon Daria had the jack set up and started working the
lever. "You remember Beavis and Butt-head?" asked Daria. Without waiting for a
reply, she added, "They told me they did this once and it worked. <span
class=GramE>Time to see if they were right."</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The trunk groaned. Both pumped at the lever, and Quinn
called forth the strength of Buffy into her limbs, adding all her strength, and
then some, to the lever. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>There was a creak and then the trunk suddenly popped open.
Not much, but it made a loud noise and the car slowed. "Oh, shit!" whispered
Daria. "Get ready to run! Scream your fucking head off this time if they catch
us, but conserve your breath otherwise!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The car slowed to a near stop. Daria and Quinn got out
together and just as their feet touched the ground, the car took off again.
Daria and Quinn grinned at each other. The car had slowed for a stop sign! But
they would HAVE to notice the trunk was open, bouncing up and down a few inches
at a time, soon. So they took off silently but as quickly as their feet would
allow. Both felt an urge to laugh in relief but didn't dare. This wasn't over
yet, and might not ever be over. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Their elation <span class=GramE>rose</span> another level
and Quinn smiled in relief as a car stopped, and Detective Cartwright got out. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Where were you!?" shouted Daria, running up to him. "We
were both attacked! Quick, call for backup before they find out we're gone and
they come back!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"They have a gun!" added Quinn just behind Daria, "I saw
it!" She wanted to get into the shelter of the car, where she could hide if
nothing else. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>But as Daria got within reach of Detective Cartwright, the
cop lashed out with a downward punch, knocking Daria to the ground. She cried
out in shock, pain, and surprise as she <span class=GramE>landed,</span> and
her glasses flew off her face. A kick lashed out and Daria was knocked away
with <span class=GramE>an <span class=SpellE>oof</span></span>. She lay
gasping, momentarily unable to fully comprehend what had just happened. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn suddenly found <span class=GramE>herself</span>
furious. The anger she felt before was a small thing to what she felt now.
Without even thinking about it, she jumped at Cartwright and landed a good blow
on his jaw with a vertical punch. Unfortunately, the blow just seemed to wake
him all the way up. Undaunted, she shrieked as she had been taught and punched
again, this time at his midsection, followed by a kick to his knee. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Suddenly, a fist hit her jaw and Quinn knew she had been
hit by a pro. His elbow then crashed on her cheek as he pulled his arm back.
Then she was slapped roughly twice and a knee went into her gut, knocking the
wind out of her. Too late, she realized that this cop had been trained in <span
class=SpellE>Krav</span> <span class=SpellE>Maga</span>... and she knew the experienced
fighters in this were utterly brutal and coldly efficient. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>His gun,</i> thought Quinn in panic as she tried to
breathe. She lashed out at his face again to distract him before going for
where she thought he kept his sidearm, but the first blow never landed. He
caught her arm, deftly twisted her arm around her thrust in a way she knew she
wasn't going to twist out of. As she tried hitting him with her other fist, he
suddenly twisted his body and arm in a way that caused her head to fall down
and hit the hood of his car. Stunned momentarily, she was helpless as his foot
kicked the back of her knee and pushed her so that she fell to both knees. Then
her arm was twisted again and her head hit the car a second time. Then he let
go and kicked her in the back of the head. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn's head hit the car for the third time. She went down
and knew no more. Blood flowed from her nose and mouth. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Detective Cartwright lingered looking at her fallen in
admiration that she had lasted as long as she had. <i>Years of <span
class=SpellE>Krav</span> <span class=SpellE>Maga</span> and street fighting
meet a couple of classes for women's self-defense, and the bitch gets her ass
kicked</i> thought Detective Cartwright darkly amused. Though he had to admit,
the beating she, and maybe Daria, had given their kidnappers <span class=GramE>was</span>
surprising. These were no ordinary middle class princesses. <i>But why should
human sacrifices be ordinary?</i>, he thought with grim amusement. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He quickly turned to deal with Daria as he heard her
running towards him, but he saw she had her glasses on and was running away. <i>That's
right, she's smart</i>, he thought. Still, it was just as futile. He pulled his
service pistol and aimed it at her. This would complicate things, but it couldn't
be helped. Who would ever think that two sheltered suburban girls could be such
trouble? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Just as he was about to squeeze off the round that would
finish her, there was a gunshot that was not his own and he felt pain rage
through his abdomen. His <span class=SpellE>Zylon</span> body armor stopped
whatever bullet it was, but he was still hurt. And his head wasn't covered by
any body armor. He saw Daria fall, but doubted she had been hit. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Shit!" he yelled, in true anger and the beginning of true
panic. He ducked, picked up Quinn, and threw her limp body in the front seat of
his car. Ducking low, he got in, started the car and tore out of there. No more
gunshots followed. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He was two blocks away before he stopped and quickly put
Quinn in cuffs, with her hands behind her back. He couldn't risk her
firecracker routine while he was driving. She was probably out for awhile, but
he now knew better than to underestimate her. He felt genuine respect for her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>And attacked an officer of the law, too</i>, he smiled
wistfully, thinking how with some serious training she could be an unusually
effective assassin since no one would ever expect violence from her. <i>We
could use her! She could be as bad ass and expert as <span class=SpellE>Dara</span>,
but under our control!</i> But there was another, more pressing use for her
now. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He sped off, Quinn unconscious and cuffed beside him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=postbody>------------------------------------------ </span><br>
<span class=postbody>04/05/01 THURSDAY 4:45 P.M. </span><br>
<span class=postbody>------------------------------------------ </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria ran. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She recognized immediately that she was not able to fight
her way out of this situation and so tried running. She would think her way out
instead. But everything kept getting screwed up over and over again. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She heard an awful silence and knew Detective Cartwright
wasn't distracted by Quinn anymore. She hated leaving her, but the best thing
she could do was use the time Quinn had given her to get help. <span
class=GramE>Real help.</span> <span class=GramE>Even if she didn't have the
slightest idea who to call.</span> Not even her mom could help her with this. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She felt very vulnerable. Being a cop, he had a gun. And
he wouldn't be arrested for using it. This was a fact she had to face. He had a
Taser, too, but she'd probably run far enough that she didn't have to worry
about it now. Even without the Taser, she had the feeling she was just as
screwed as if she had been shot outright. This was a section of town with many
boarded-up and empty buildings. There was no one around to ask for help. And
who would help her - the notorious teen gunslinger - against a cop, anyway? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She didn't know why he'd attacked her and Quinn, but she
could tell he had reasons that he'd kept well hidden from the light of day, and
most likely was not fulfilling his official duties. But would anyone believe
her? Would the police help her or help him? It wasn't pleasant to think about. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Every second, every step, stretched out the silent pause
that was already too long. She was wondering why there wasn't a shot when she
heard one--and a blast of fire right in front of her. <i>Who the hell is this,
Detective Warner!?</i> Daria fell and rolled, knowing true despair. This time
there wasn't any way out of this. She couldn't run, fight, or hide. When she
rolled, she just lay on the ground, momentarily losing her will to put up
anything more than token resistance. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Moments later she heard a car screeching and knew
Cartwright was leaving. She turned to look for Quinn and saw she was gone too.
She turned toward the rapidly approaching footsteps and tried to get to her
feet to run one last time if she must. The man jogging up had short, blond hair
and wore a bland, conservative business suit. He was past his youth but younger
than her dad and in much better shape. He had a gun in his right hand, finger
off the trigger. She took that as a good sign even though she didn't know who
he was or why he had shot at Detective Cartwright. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Come on! <span class=GramE>On your feet, Daria!"</span>
He reached down and pulled her up by her wrist. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria got on her feet. "How do you know my name?" She knew
that was a dumb question, but she was too rattled to ask why he was helping
her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Not now," he said. "Follow me, or wait here. <span
class=GramE>Your choice."</span> He turned and ran down the alley he had come
from. After a single breath, Daria took off after him. Coming out of the other
end of the alley, she saw a nondescript blue car. Both man and car would be
unnoticed in most situations. She heard the lock click on the passenger side
and she got in, breathing hard. He pulled away quickly, making a U and heading
back the way he'd seen Detective Cartwright go. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"That's a detective you shot," said Daria, still breathing
hard. She thought he should know. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He laughed. <span class=GramE>"Yeah.</span> And I may
dance with the needle over it, but if you saw his face when I shot him..." He
laughed out loud then. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Who are you?" asked Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>"Name's Earl Gentry.</span></span><span
class=postbody> I'm a PI working for Mrs. Marguerite Kramer, the DA. I was
following Detective Cartwright when I saw him stop suddenly. I pulled around
the corner and snuck up just in time to see him bash your sister's head against
the car and then pull a gun on you while you were running away. So what's his
problem?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I don't know!" cried Daria. "None of this makes any
sense!" A single sob escaped her. When the man said nothing, she asked, "Can
you call my mom? She's supposed to be meeting with <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>."
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"<span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>?" the PI asked. "So
your mom is away from home? That's interesting." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yeah, the mind boggles," said Daria. "Can you call her?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He picked up a cell phone and hit a button. "I can do
almost as good," he said. After a moment, he said, "Yeah, Earl here. I'm in a
dire situation and I could use some serious backup. Detective Cartwright has
kidnapped Quinn, I repeat Cartwright has kidnapped, not arrested, Quinn after
brutally beating her. He tried to shoot Daria while she was running away. Daria
is with me in the car now. She says her mom is meeting with <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>."
After a pause, he added, "Yeah, I was thinking that was interesting too. <span
class=GramE>Just a minute."</span> His voice came sharper and was intended for
Daria. "Let me guess. Your dad's not home either is he?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No," said Daria. "He had a deal that was too good to pass
up. And the cops are gone, too." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Curiouser and <span class=SpellE>curiouser</span>," said
the PI before talking into the phone again. "Mr. Morgendorffer is away on
important business too. She says the cops watching the place are gone. Someone
really wants these girls, and I doubt it's just Cartwright. I think you should
call the police and the FBI." A moment more and he added, "I think he went to
his house. That's the right direction. I don't know for what. Okay. How about
the Lane residence? Okay, meet me there." Then he hit a button and put the
phone down. As Daria stared at him, he said, "Look, uh, can we keep the, um,
shooting of Cartwright between me and you? It will probably come out and all,
but I don't see a need to volunteer the information." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria <span class=GramE>blinked,</span> her breath almost
back to normal. "Sure, fine by me." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I got something for you, Daria. Given the situation, I
think you can appreciate it. I hope I'm not making a mistake doing this." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"What?" asked Daria, suspiciously. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The PI reached into behind him with one hand while still
driving. A moment later he handed her a gun. "Recognize it?" he asked. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"This isn't the gun I had," said Daria taking it. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>"Nope.</span></span><span
class=postbody> Same model, though," he said. <span class=GramE>"An Autauga
Mark II .32 <span class=SpellE>ACP</span>.</span> When Mrs. Kramer first hired
me, it was to find out where you got the gun from. That was before we found out
all kinds of things that were far more interesting. But I had that to question
other people. I know you didn't get it from a gun show out of town, but who
cares? You know how to use one of these so do me a favor and guard my back and
I'll guard yours." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria took the gun and examined it. A .32 Mark <span
class=GramE>II,</span> fully loaded. She looked back at him and asked, "You
trust me?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Of course I do," he said. "You're at an age that you
should be trusted. No prior convictions and this is the first time you're being
investigated. I know you learned to use that gun but you were still upset after
you used it. Even on the tape I could see that. You're no sociopath, but you do
know how to shoot. Yes, I trust you." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria nodded. "Yeah, okay," she said. "I take it that if
this is found on me, I don't say where I got it?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Actually, I'll stick my neck out on this one, Daria. You've
been shafted enough as it is. Just use it to save my life if it comes down to
it, the way I saved yours. Deal?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Deal," said Daria. "But we've got to get Quinn away from
Cartwright!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"It's being taken care of, Daria. But right now we're
going to Casa Lane as I believe it's called. People on both sides of the law
have been very interested in Mystik Spiral. You wouldn't know why, would you?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No," said Daria, though she had an idea extrapolated from
what she knew and from what her mom had told her. She got a strong feeling that
the PI knew a lot more than he was letting on right now. He was either trying
to verify what he thought he knew, testing her honesty, character and
involvement, or both. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"We'll get some help there anyway. Your home isn't safe
right now. And I have a strong feeling that the Lanes may be having their own
problems. Here, call them for me, okay?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria took the cell phone and dialed. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yo," answered Jane sounding normal. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Jane?" asked Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Daria?" asked Jane concerned, "what's wrong?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Everything. Are you okay?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"We're holding down the fort." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"We?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Me, Mystik Spiral." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"What are they doing?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Band practice in the basement. They're supposed to meet a
promoter here in just a few minutes and they want to be ready for him. Why?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Don't let anyone in, Jane!" cried Daria. "I'll be there
in about five minutes and I'll give you a call when we're out in front. Don't
let anyone else in, and don't answer the door for anyone until we get there! <span
class=GramE>It's</span> important." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Okay, amiga," sounding more concerned. "So what happened?"
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Tell you when we get there, you won't believe it," said
Daria. "Remember, nobody." Jane didn't say anything and Daria hung up. "Everything
is okay, but Mystik Spiral is there, practicing in the basement. <span
class=GramE>Waiting for a promoter to show up."</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The PI said nothing, but started driving faster. </span><br

<span class=postbody>CHAPTER 11 </span><br>
<span class=postbody>----------------------------------- </span><br>
<span class=postbody>04/05/01 THURSDAY 4:50 P.M. </span><br>
<span class=postbody>----------------------------------- </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Detective Cartwright realized this was going to be awkward
in so many ways. <span class=GramE>The first being that he now had to go pick
up Scott for the next phase, and he and Quinn would then be in the same car
together.</span> Scott was wound up, and it was going to be hard to keep him
from killing Quinn before all the pieces were set up for it to go down. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Having seen that at least two of the Ice Cold <span
class=SpellE>tweakers</span> had had the crap beaten of them, he hoped they
hadn't left blood at the Morgendorffer's residence. But seeing the looks of one
of them, the one who banged furiously on the trunk with the two girls stashed
in it, he was sure they left blood behind. That would complicate matters. He
was glad that only one of them, the most level headed, had been allowed to
carry a gun in there.</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The other <span class=SpellE>tweaker</span> beaten up by
the girls had had to be helped out to the car, and he was struggling to
breathe. Cartwright had whistled when he'd seen that. These girls were not to
be underestimated. Still, as long as he was ready for any of their surprises,
they could be dealt with easily enough. They may be extraordinary suburban
girls, but they were still suburban girls. He'd just be sure to not
underestimate them while not overestimating them, either. <i>I'll be one of the
few on this planet that walks that fine line</i>, he chuckled to himself. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He frowned. The blood dripping from Quinn's nose and mouth
was now staining the upholstery. <span class=GramE>Couldn't be helped.</span>
He'd have to work on this. Especially with the FBI so interested in him and the
body of that gook he'd killed. That the FBI wanted to examine the body with
their own forensics team made him very, very nervous. He hoped there would be
nothing else they could get that would incriminate him, but it looked as though
it was going to happen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>Maybe it was a fed that shot me</i>, he mused. Then he
dismissed it. A fed was unlikely to risk <span class=GramE>his own</span> life
to save a teenage girl. <span class=GramE>Especially one that was being tried
for murder.</span> <span class=GramE><i>Unless they want her for a witness</i>.</span>
Then he remembered that the crazed bitch <span class=SpellE>Dara</span> of a
thousand faces had been upset when she'd found out that both girls were to be
killed tonight and he knew delicious fear. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>No, if she'd shot me, I would be dead</i>, he told
himself, and fully believed it. He couldn't see what use she had for him alive,
and if they had reason to think he was about to be pinched by the feds, it
might mean they would kill him just so he couldn't talk. Maybe he was to die
with everyone else. He licked his lips. <span class=GramE>Time to call in for
some help.</span> He made a quick call to Detective Warner, hoping Quinn wouldn't
stir next to him. Warner was an idiot, but he didn't feel like testing the
theoretical limits of his stupidity today. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He hoped Warner would be dumb enough to try catching Daria
herself. <span class=GramE>Daria would likely fight back and Warner would kill
her out of fear.</span> He was such a coward, too. He almost <span class=GramE>peed</span>
his pants when he realized Matthew was shooting up Lawndale High. He'd probably
shoot Daria the moment Daria resisted, and after what she'd been through, she
likely would. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He himself wasn't scared to die. Actually, he looked
forward to it. He had already died, years ago. Now he was just contempt and
bitterness kept alive by the Ice Cold and what he called the "<span
class=SpellE>got'cha</span>" moments. He absolutely despised Lawndale above all
else, but Wild Card had ordered him to come. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Not that he was the type to follow orders. Not anymore.
But Wild Card was a true mover and shaker in the world. He had to respect that.
And it was temporary, only until the Lawndale PD could be sufficiently
corrupted and controlled, and then Wild Card would have him transferred back to
DC. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Washington, DC. <span class=GramE>The city that killed his
soul.</span> He had gotten into law enforcement to fight drug dealers. It was
how he would make up for the death of his little brother. Damn kid had gotten
into his stash and snorted some uncut cocaine. It wasn't a pretty death. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The coke was never traced to him and no one investigated
him over it. Except his brother was dead and it was his fault. So he stopped
dealing, determined to someday do more to fight the War on Drugs for his
brother. <i>If it weren't for Bobby, I might still be like Scott and Matthew.</i>
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The following year, he'd joined the US Army and become a
MP. He quickly learned that DC was just a playpen compared to the Army. His
brother soldiers were undisciplined, constantly fighting, drinking, drugging,
raping, beating up on their spouses, and killing (outside their job
description). And it wasn't just the grunts. He'd help bust a corporal who'd
been exchanging guns for cocaine. The guy got sent to 6 months of NA meetings. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He learned there were more scams than even his twisted
imagination had come up with. For example, some sergeants would recommend "good
places" to drink, gamble, and whore to the privates under them. The green
19-year-olds would go, be drugged, beaten and robbed. Most were too humiliated
to report the assault. The few who did were further humiliated with the officer's
"Well, what were you doing in a place like that anyway, private?" And it was
all so the sergeant could get a cut of the takings. He learned well as a MP: If
you weren't a cop, you were shit. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>That lesson was repeated to him when he mustered out and
signed up to become a civilian police officer: If you weren't a cop, you were a
piece of shit. And now he was fighting the drug dealers in his home city </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He'd felt reborn for awhile. He was finally making up for
killing his little brother. But he quickly learned of the graft and corruption
of the police. It wasn't just the police, either. The mayor got busted for
smoking crack. The DEA routinely "lost evidence" that strongly suggested that
the runny noses in the office weren't from the common cold. Even President Bill
Clinton had "coffee klatches" with known drug lords. Heck, one reason he didn't
mind getting into selling cocaine himself as a teen was because Oliver North
got away with it. It almost seemed patriotic. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>And as for him, he was told to cooperate with informants
who were themselves drug dealers. The police scored busts and the informants
got rid of their competition at the same time. The dealers even gave gifts to
the cops they dealt <span class=GramE>with,</span> and higher ups too. Some
would call that bribery, but he was assured it was just the informer showing
appreciation. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>And there were so many informants. After all, any
informant could be lying, so there had to be others to check with. And after
awhile, he found out he wasn't just fighting a war on SOME drugs, but a war
only on SOME drug dealers. In short, he was helping to keep drugs flowing
smoothly on the streets, not stopping it. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He was a failure. He'd killed his little brother, and now
there were many others out there getting killed. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>And already depressed, he then had to clean up the body of
an underage girl who had <span class=SpellE>ODed</span>. <span class=GramE>Just
another runaway.</span> <span class=GramE>Pretty little thing, red hair, sort
of like Quinn, now that he thought about it.</span> He knew she hadn't done it
to herself. Pimps routinely got their whores hooked so they wouldn't try
running from the stable. The captain said the girls were no loss, just street
trash anyway, but he couldn't help but think of his own sister, and of all
those people out there who were losing sisters as well as brothers. <span
class=GramE>Because of him and his job.</span> <span class=GramE>Just like he'd
lost his brother with his former job.</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He'd pushed very hard to bust the pimp that had killed the
girl. But officially, she had died injecting herself with drugs. <span
class=GramE>Suicide or accidental OD, but not manslaughter.</span>
Unofficially, he was told the pimp was owned by one of the well-connected and
wealthy lawyers retained by the DEA. He not only got a share of the pimp's
profits but he used the pimp's stable for some of his private parties.
According to the unofficial report, his guest regularly included high ranking
police officers and politicians. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He spent a weekend contemplating ending his own life with
his service pistol. But that wasn't right. He should die the way his brother
did, the way that underage girl had died, the way so many others were dying
thanks to cops like him, everywhere in America. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The following Monday, before he had time to start his self
destruction, he was placed on undercover assignments for Vice. He was directed
to get Big Tony to trust him. It was understood that this would include taking
drugs from him, to "prove" he wasn't an undercover cop. When the matter came to
court, he was to deny, deny, deny. No, of course he'd never taken any drugs.
The dealer was lying. No jury would take the word of accused dealers over that
of a cop. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He learned it was real easy to pass the lie detectors,
too, and did so many times. Just psyche yourself out thinking of the hairy
situations you had been in and then let yourself calm down (and perhaps
disassociate) as you answered the questions. You'd pass with flying colors.
There was just no other way to get that deep in otherwise. So even though his
superiors knew about it, it was tolerated, and all he had to do was deny, deny,
<span class=GramE>deny</span> any allegations of wrong doing in a court of law.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He suspected he had been put where he could be killed if
he made trouble over the dead girl. And if he didn't make trouble, but refused
to do the drugs, then he'd be blackballed for failure and be drummed out of the
department. If he did the drugs, he'd get so dirty that he'd never be able to
turn on other cops without going down himself. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He accepted the assignment. It was the perfect cover to
kill <span class=GramE>himself</span> the way he'd killed Bobby, the way the
girl he couldn't get justice for had died. But it was a slow way to die. How he
hated everyone, most of all himself. Everything he had tried to fight against
he had become, just by doing his job. He had made detective in almost record
time, but he was still used in street operations a lot, including undercover
work, because he was so good at it. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>And then one treacherous cop blew the whistle. The
internal affairs and DA investigated... and cleared them all. The whistle blower
was fired, ruined, and then chased out of the city. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>After that, Cartwright had an epiphany: Being a cop wasn't
about upholding the law, but about upholding each other. And their purpose wasn't
to keep the streets safe but to preserve the status quo. The fact that the
police often worked together with some criminals was overlooked as long as it
preserved the status quo. A status quo in which rich lawyers and politicians
got huge payoffs from drug dealers that were rich off of prohibition, in which
cops were themselves addicts, and in which young girls were broken by pimps and
sometimes killed in the process. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>And the rest of humanity?</span></span><span
class=postbody> Also a piece of <span class=GramE>shit,</span> or so incredibly
stupid that they should be killed so as not to breed. In short: If you're a cop,
you're a major piece of shit. If you're not a cop, then you were a stupid piece
of shit. All this time he'd been feeling guilty about his brother and the
little prostitute and they were just shit too. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>So he himself was an addict. <span class=GramE>An addict
with a badge, and an adrenaline junkie to boot.</span> He loved getting away
with stuff, and knowing how he would be protected only emboldened him. Then he
tried Ice Cold and his "<span class=SpellE>got'cha</span>" moments began. He
sometimes shot people for the hell of it. Sometimes he used his own gun, other
times he used another gun and claimed to find the victim shot. He made a dozen
little mistakes, but he always got away with it. Sometimes he wondered if he
WANTED to get caught, given some of the stunts he pulled. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Then he met Wild Card, one of the new players, and
Cartwright knew he had met the karma of this great nation. Wild Card was going
to be the biggest, <span class=SpellE>baddest</span> "<span class=SpellE>got'cha</span>"
that there ever had been. He felt privileged to be in on it. And Wild Card was
such a <span class=GramE>player,</span> he even manipulated Cartwright's
bosses. He got Cartwright transferred to Lawndale, under the pretense that he
was in danger from being recognized for the many meth busts he had done. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>What his superiors didn't know was that Wild Card had
given him the information about the dealers, and the orders to go get them, not
the police. He had tremendous success. If, inexplicably, the case fell apart
and the dealer got only a little jail time, he'd let Wild Card know when the
man was getting out. No one lived past their first day back on the streets when
Wild Card wanted them dead. Actually, that had been something of a rush. When
Wild Card had gotten him transferred to Lawndale, the armpit of America, he'd
wondered at first what he'd done wrong. Then the orders came. And Ice Cold came
with the orders. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>His heart raced in anticipation of doing a line right now
as he turned into his driveway. Maybe he would get caught. And maybe that was
what he finally wanted. Could he handle getting old and retiring? No fucking
way. He'd shoot himself in the head before he gave this up, and he wasn't
shooting himself in the head. So maybe he wanted to be caught and killed. But
until he was, he was going to continue to work for his real allegiance. <span
class=GramE>Because he loved getting away with it too much to stop.</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>So far</i>, he reminded himself. He had never been
investigated by the FBI before. Not to mention the BATF. That one guy, Agent
Fleming, here in town seemed to glare at him suspiciously every time he looked
his way. He knew this was bad, though he was by no means defeated. But he would
have to be more careful than he had ever been before. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He smiled a bit derisively as he thought of his partner
and native <span class=SpellE>Lawndalian</span>, Detective Warner. What an
idiot. He really believed the crap he came up with. Even better, he believed
just about anything Cartwright came up with, not wanting to look like some
sheltered small town dick compared to the man from the big city. But Cartwright
was street material, and he had been taught well. Detective Warner was just a
clownish small town Keystone Kop. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He had to go in and get Scott. The kid reminded him of
himself, when he was a stupid kid, but this had to be done. <span class=GramE>Had
to be done tonight.</span> So be it. Checking Quinn one last time, he sighed
and got out, impatient for the next phase to begin. He wondered how long it
would take to gather those stupid jerk-offs who probably still didn't realize
Daria and Quinn were no longer in the trunk. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>As he opened his car door, his radio crackled an APB on
Daria and Quinn along with an unknown suspect that was with them, for attempted
murder of a police officer. All 3 were to be considered armed and dangerous. <i>Such
useful idiots</i>, Cartwright thought derisively. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He looked back at Quinn one last time before he got out.
Quinn remained limp, breathing shallowly beside him, a line of blood dripping
from her face onto her clothes and the upholstery. <i>You're good kid</i> he
silently congratulated. <span class=GramE><i>But not as good as me.</i></span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He went in to get his line of Ice Cold and then to get
Scott from where he was chained to a heavy chest in the garage. He wondered if
the boy was stupid enough to think he would live after he was used to kill
Quinn. They both had an appointment to die tonight. Maybe Daria would commit
suicide in a jail cell, or be killed for resisting arrest. He smiled, feeling
excitement as he wondered if he was to die tonight, too. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn came to just in time to see Scott Rhodes coming out
of a strange house. She started, and then realized she was cuffed. Cartwright
came out and she remembered him beating the crap out of her. She remembered the
thugs and being locked in the trunk and everything except where Daria was. "Daria?"
asked Quinn, somewhat groggily, "Buffy? <span class=GramE>Mom?</span> <span
class=GramE>Dad?</span> <span class=GramE>Anyone?"</span> Her voice was barely
intelligible. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Scott caught her gaze and gave her a hate-filled glare
that only deepened her panic. Then she saw Cartwright see her awake and he
grinned like he had just told the funniest joke. He pointed his index finger at
her with his thumb held high, like a little boy gesturing with a pretend gun,
and mouthed something that looked like, "<span class=SpellE>got'cha</span>." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>This was a dream. <span class=GramE>A nightmare.</span> It
had to be. But the cuffs felt very real, as did the excruciating pain and
dizziness radiating through her body. The one small mercy was that she was
unconscious again by the time the car doors opened and Cartwright and Scott
Rhodes got in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=postbody>------------------------------------- </span><br>
<span class=postbody>04/05/01 THURSDAY 5:30 PM </span><br>
<span class=postbody>---------------------------------------- </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So there isn't a promoter on the way," said Trent,
sounding more discouraged by this than by the fact he might be dead soon. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"It's certainly not very likely," replied Mr. Gentry. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"We don't have anything to do with crystal..." <span
class=GramE>added</span> Trent. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I know that," said Mr. Gentry cutting him off, "and I
think I have enough proof to clear you of any involvement." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You think?" Trent's left brow rose. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Juries are fickle," Mr. Gentry shrugged. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So why did all those people bug us about it?" asked an
irritated Max. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Word somehow got started that you were meth dealers.
Apparently you stood up to a gun man, the same one that Daria shot later?" When
Trent didn't acknowledge it in any way, he continued, "So some people thought
you might be into drugs with Matthew. There are some new players popping up all
over the state of Virginia, and now in Florida and surrounding states as well.
No one knows who they are. Some thought you might know. Thing is, the police I
caught taking pictures of you always seemed to know when you were going to be
sharing space with the local dealers. At first I figured they must have someone
on the inside giving them leads, probably false ones." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"At first?" asked Trent. "What do you think now?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Set up. It came the day after you played McGrundy's. I
sat in to watch you just to see if anything interesting would happen. Sure
enough, Evil Eddie shows up and stays through a song and someone took photos of
them watching you. And then the next day I find out Evil Eddie and his entire <span
class=GramE>entourage have</span> been murdered. One immediate survivor, but
she tried shooting a cop and she was killed herself. <span class=GramE>By Detective
Cartwright."</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria closed her eyes and felt hope leaving her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"He shot her in self defense. There's enough evidence
there that his story makes sense. Some people, obviously jacked up on crystal
meth of some kind, tore that place apart. It's not surprising that one, either
on meth or in shock or both, tried to shoot Detective Cartwright when he
investigated. He was considered lucky not to have been killed himself." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Bad luck for us," muttered Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Luckily, you have an alibi for the time of the murders.
And you have one for right after because I followed you home after your gig.
And then Officer Corelli made a statement yesterday to me that verified you
were being set up." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Corelli?" asked Trent. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The cop shot outside my home," said Daria casually. <span
class=GramE>"The one that lived." <br>
<br>
"Oh.</span> Why set us up?" asked Trent, sounding more curious than upset. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I don't know yet. But you're integral to this. So are
Daria and Quinn. But I don't know why! Not yet. But the FBI and BATF are both
interested in all of you as well. They seem more interested in other things,
though, and I'm not sure just how interested they are in all of you
specifically." He shrugged. "I was following Cartwright to see who he was going
to meet when I ran into him attacking Daria and Quinn." He shook his head. "He
appears to want Daria and Quinn alive. For sure, he took Quinn alive, after
beating her unconscious. I don't think he wanted to kill Daria, but the
situation got out of his control too much to let her get away." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"And maybe my sister dies tonight because he lost control,"
said Daria. Then, as Mr. Gentry's cell phone rang, she added, "How long are we
going to stay here and do nothing?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mr. Gentry sighed. "Let me get this, Daria. It might be
important." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria leaned back, crossed her arms, and muttered, "You
sound like my mom." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yeah," said Mr. Gentry into his phone, "she's still with
me." Then he frowned deeply and turned away, talking in a low voice that was
hard to hear. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane touched Daria's arm and whispered, "Are you sure you
can trust this guy, Daria? Maybe he's setting us all up." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria shook her head no. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"How can you trust him?" asked Jane. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Because he trusted me," Daria replied simply. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mr. Gentry put his cell phone away. "There's a
complication, Daria," he said, going to the window and peeking out before
turning around. "The police are looking for you: attempted murder of a police
officer. Detective Cartwright claims you, Quinn, and an unknown gunman shot at
him and he's requesting assistance in finding all three of you. It's probably
only a matter of time before they come here." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Shit!" said Jane. "Daria, you have to leave!" Jane's eyes
filled with tears. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No good," said Mr. Gentry. "You leave and they'll catch
you all the faster. After letting that blonde get away, you can bet they're
gonna have a net up in the outer perimeters first and close it in. There's
nowhere to go, Daria. Not without a good disguise anyway, and I don't think you're
experienced enough for that." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria leaned back and sighed. "If I'm taken into custody,
I'll tell the truth." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mr. Gentry chuckled cynically. <span class=GramE>"The
truth?</span> Who cares about the truth? Detective Cartwright has the truth, as
far as everybody who counts cares. It's your word against his, and the evidence
is on his side." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Only because he's the one to collect it," said Daria
bitterly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mr. Gentry shrugged. "True. But Mrs. Kramer said she just
had someone drop a file off that is very enlightening, though I don't know what
she means by that. Said she didn't think the boy who delivered it was really a
delivery boy for UPS like he claimed. It's even claimed that the FBI has just
put out an APB for Cartwright for <span class=GramE>their own</span> reasons.
And for what it's worth, I'm willing to get on the stand and say Cartwright is
a lying sack of shit. But if you run, it looks bad." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Headlights lit up the window facing the driveway, letting
them know that darkness and trouble both arrived. "Is it the police?" asked
Jane. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mr. Gentry looked out and quickly let the curtain drop. <span
class=GramE>"Nope.</span> Your promoter is here, along with Cartwright.
Everybody upstairs right now," he said calmly as he pulled a gun. "If you have
a gun, then get it. But you don't have much time at all. I said move it." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>His voice was calm, but his words got through. Everyone
started up the stairs. Daria had her own gun <span class=GramE>out,</span>
swearing she would use it as well as Quinn could fight. When there was a knock
at the door, everyone speeded up. Mr. Gentry was in the rear, gun in one hand,
cell phone in the other. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>They ended up Jane's room and were all working on moving
the bed against the door when they heard people coming up the stairs. They had
managed to get in without breaking a window. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Some promoter," said Daria to Trent. Trent just frowned
at her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Everyone <span class=GramE>get</span> out of the line of
fire," said Mr. Gentry. Seeing that most people were out of immediate harm's
way, he began to accept the altered state of consciousness brought on by his
adrenaline. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Someone tried their door. There was a yell when the door
refused to open. <span class=GramE>Then a banging.</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Hey, just open up," said Detective Cartwright sounding
calm, "I'm here with the police. We just want to talk. There's a reasonable
explanation for all of this. But you need to open up." After a moment, the
doorknob jiggled a bit. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Motherfucker," whispered Mr. Gentry. He went near the
door, aimed his gun down near the knob and fired 3 shots and then quickly
rolled out of the way. "He's trying to jimmy the lock!" he said, just before
several gunshots erupted from outside. Several bullets managed to pierce the
door fully or in part. It wasn't going to hold. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Someone started kicking at the door then. Mr. Gentry
rolled out and fired at the door again. This time, the bullet went through and
they heard a man screaming outside. Mr. Gentry rolled again as several more
gunshots tore the door into pieces and the glass in a window on the far wall
splintered and fell. Daria hoped the home invaders would run out of ammo soon.
The door wasn't going to even exist if it took any more damage. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>And then they heard Detective Cartwright's voice from down
the hall. He laughed. And then there were more gunshots, this time from further
away. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Do we get out?" asked Daria lightly. She asked louder
when Mr. Gentry silently asked her to repeat it. Her own ears were ringing and
she couldn't tell how loud she was being. "Do we leave?" she said. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He used his cell phone again. "Talk to me, has the cavalry
arrived?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>There was a kick at their door. Splinters flew. They heard
Detective Cartwright's voice shrieking at them. "Your help is as dead as Quinn!
Open the goddamn door!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria crawled in line with the door and fired 3 shots, but
all three were stopped by the door. "Rotten luck," she muttered, "with all the
holes ..." Then another two shots answered from the other side. She flattened to
the floor and the bullets went over her head. Daria raised her head, fired
again, and this time her bullet found a weak spot and went into the hall
beyond. They heard a hoarse, "Oh shit!" and the thump of a gun on the floor,
then the sound of feet running away. Mr. Gentry leaned out and fired, but there
was silence on the other side. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Give me that!" uttered Mr. Gentry in a low, urgent voice.
"This is ending, you didn't have a gun, <span class=GramE>I</span> fired it.
Got that?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Uh, okay," said Daria. Everyone else, down low and as far
to the edge as they could get, nodded. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>There were a few more gun shots and then voices
downstairs. More lights were showing up outside. Some of them were red and
blue, but no one felt comforted. <span class=GramE>More voices and movement
outside.</span> There were a lot of people in Casa Lane now. <span class=GramE>And
a lot of shooting.</span> </span><br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

<span class=postbody>CHAPTER 13 </span><br>
<span class=postbody>---------------------------------------- </span><br>
<span class=postbody>04/05/01 THURSDAY 6:00 PM </span><br>
<span class=postbody>----------------------------------------- </span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Mr. Earl Gentry?" a voice rang just outside their door,
off to the side. The shooting seemed to have stopped, but all their ears still
rang with it, and their adrenaline pumped furiously. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Who's asking?" replied Mr. Gentry, with a little more
force than was polite. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Agent <span class=SpellE>Highwater</span>, FBI." The
voice was also tense. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mr. Gentry laughed, almost joyously. "I'm so glad you
arrived. Look, I'm the only one armed. No one else has a gun. They're kids that
have been through a traumatic experience and aren't likely to respond well to
people with guns, even if they have a badge. What say you let me lead them out
all friendly like and you treat them like the crime victims they are?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>There was silence for a minute. <span class=GramE>Then, "Your
call, Mr. Gentry.</span> I'll assume you know what you're doing." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Moving the bed, the door swung open without even being
opened. Mr. Gentry whistled at that. Then he went out. When no shots were
fired, the others went out silently, staring at the several agents staring at
them... and at the blood on the walls and carpet. When they were out, a few of
the agents went into the room they had been hiding in. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Hope you didn't have any wacky weed in there," said Mr.
Gentry lightly to Jane. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Nope," said Jane. "None in the house either." <i>Not
since the cops have been breathing down our neck about it.</i> She was glad
Trent had gotten rid of what little had been in the house just before the first
sweep, right after the shooting at Lawndale High, and not ever allowed any in
since then. Their parent's bedroom was their parent's concern, but since
nothing was found the first time, she doubted there was any there now. She
wondered what her mom and dad would do when they got back from their respective
locations to find out about this. Then she forgot all about that as she got a
clear view of the top of the stairs. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>There were some people around a dead body at the top of the
stairs. <i>This must be who Mr. Gentry shot</i>, thought Daria. They quickly
went down where there were more bodies. One was Scott Rhodes. <span
class=GramE>Messy.</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria ran outside to get away from the horrible sights and
smells. She hoped desperately that she'd find Quinn in better shape. She saw
that an ambulance was included among the emergency vehicles and another was
just turning in. Then she ran up to one gurney when she saw a familiar crop of
red hair. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Quinn?" asked Daria, guilt festering within her for
leaving her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn opened her eyes. The very movement seemed painful. "Daria,"
she breathed and tried to smile, not quite making it. "I'm glad you're okay.
That guy said you were dead." She took in a gasp of air. "Scott was with him."
She blinked, and added sleepily, "How weird is that?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria didn't trust herself to speak. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Quinn added, "Someone got me out of the car and took the
cuffs off." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Okay, that's enough," said an <span class=SpellE>EMT</span>.
"We need to get her to the hospital." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria got out of the way and Quinn was moved into the
ambulance, with an <span class=SpellE>EMT</span> telling Quinn to stay awake.
Daria had turned back to the house when she saw another gurney with a man
handcuffed to it. She started over to it but was seized by two medical
technicians and a man with a federal badge. She struggled against them as she
saw it was Cartwright. He was in a lot better shape than Quinn. He smiled
warmly at her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You bastard!" she roared at him. She struggled even
harder when he continued to smile. He seemed to enjoy her condemnation. Another
man grabbed at her arms and held her. She was about to break his grip when his
voice calmed her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"That's enough," he said. "Don't get yourself locked up
over him. He's in for a rough time and it's only going to get rougher. Why don't
you go to the hospital with your sister? Your mother is on her way." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria spat at Cartwright and turned away. They let her go.
She found Quinn was unconscious and almost went back again to try to hurt
Cartwright herself when she saw something that chilled her: BATF agents. She
suddenly remembered her time in Mr. Van Driessen's class when they had stormed
in. She had seen enough violence for one day. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"There she is!" The outburst startled Daria not only in
its intensity but because it was Detective Warner. Daria turned to see him
struggling with two BATF agents. "It's her, her and her sister! They tried to
kill my partner and you're treating him like the criminal! You're cops, we're
not <span class=GramE>suppose</span> to fight each other!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Your partner opened fired on us, laughing like a loon,"
said an FBI agent. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"It wasn't him, it was the Morgendorffers and the Lanes!"
he shouted. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Another man accompanied, by a man and woman just behind
him on either side, came up and the older man pushed the FBI agent gently but
firmly aside. "I'll take it from here, Agent <span class=SpellE>Clowes</span>."
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He was older, but seemed to still be in his prime, if a
bit too stiff. He sported short, white hair that was almost a crew cut, square
glasses and a suit that screamed government agent. He struck Daria as having a
poker face and very dangerous. And she recognized him. This was the man who had
interrogated her teacher, Mr. Van Driessen, and even chewed out her principal
right in front of her and the entire class shortly before she moved to
Lawndale. His face had been cold when one of his agents slammed a gun into Van
Driessen's guts, and while the BATF went around destroying anything they could
get a hold of, for the sheer love of destruction. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria also recognized the man beside him. More rotund and
with short, red hair, he was still unmistakably a government agent. But she
didn't recognize the sour-faced, robust blonde that stood on his other side. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The older man narrowed his eyes and put his hands on his
hips, almost as if he were resting his hands over unseen guns. "Detective Warner,
I'm Special Agent Fleming, ATF, here to investigate the treasonous drug ring
and death squads that you tried to pin on these innocent kids." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Detective Warner blinked and suddenly looked confused. "<span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Wh</span></span><span class=GramE>-</span>what?"
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Look, Officer Scum," said Agent Fleming in
well-controlled anger, "we know all about your dirty ring. <span class=GramE>Drugs.</span>
<span class=GramE>Bombs.</span> <span class=GramE>Guns.</span> <span
class=GramE>Ice Cold.</span> <span class=GramE>The murder of Agent Chin of the
FBI when she came close to blowing your whole operation.</span> We know
everything. Did you really think you could get away with it by blaming it all
on a couple of high school girls that lived in terror of your thugs?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Detective Warner shook his head as if to clear it. "I don't
understand what the hell you're talking about. The Morgendorffers are the ones
behind it all! Ask Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"<span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> has already been taken
into custody," said Agent Fleming, "so rest assured we will be asking him.
Right now I'm asking you." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Detective Warner looked to Detective Cartwright who lay on
his gurney laughing lightly. "What's he talking about, partner?" he asked,
suspicion in his voice. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Oh, I'm sorry," said Detective Cartwright, not sounding
sorry at all. "They found out about everything. I'd cover for you, but we're
not the type to fall on a grenade for each other. I'd rather get the lighter prison
sentence by testifying against you!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"What!?" shouted Detective Warner, fear and rage building
in his voice, "I'll kill you!" He lunged for his former partner but was
wrestled down by four BATF agents while Agent Fleming glared at him coldly and
the two beside him simply stared. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Detective Cartwright laughed. <i>Not what I had in mind,
but I can still say 'gotcha' to someone!</i> <span class=GramE>he</span>
thought. He hated and despised Warner, but he'd been a wonderful dupe and tool.
Now he would testify against Warner for a lighter sentence. Not that Warner was
involved in this <span class=GramE>one,</span> he was just a useful idiot. But
he'd sent enough other people off to prison for crimes they hadn't committed,
and had tried to do so again, so he deserved this. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>So had Cartwright, but Cartwright didn't care about that. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Want to tell me about Dallas Grimes?" asked Agent
Fleming. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Who?" asked Detective Warner, now in cuffs and breathing <span
class=GramE>hard.</span> He blinked when he saw Agent Fleming's tightening
face. "Oh, the blonde who, uh, shot the two police officers, <span
class=SpellE>Delancey</span> and Corelli..." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Dallas Grimes is Warner's girlfriend," shouted Detective
Cartwright. "If you want to know about that, talk to me." He sounded completely
serious, even while he was enjoying the macabre joke. <i>All those years of
undercover work continue to pay off.</i> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Fleming turned to Cartwright. "Get him out of here!
We'll deal with him later!" Turning back, he pointed at Detective Warner. "As
for this treasonous scum that threatened national security, aided and abetted
America's enemies, aided and abetted a woman wanted for capital murder of his
fellow officers, and attempted to undermine the authority of the United States
government while involving innocent teenagers in his sick game..." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The bland agent behind Agent Fleming crossed his arms.
Sounding bored, he asked, "Cavity search?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Deep and hard," said Agent Fleming. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Agent Hurley," Bork nodded to her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Wait, you can't do this! I have rights!" said Detective
Warner desperately. "Cops don't do this to cops!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You're not a cop anymore, Officer Scumbag. Take him away!"
He watched coldly as Detective Warner was carried, struggling all the way, to a
waiting van and Agent Hurley put on a plastic glove. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Bork asked him, "We don't know how many cops have
been corrupted, do we?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"They all know something," said Agent Fleming, crossing
his arms. "I want full cavity searches. Everyone! <span class=GramE>The entire
police department.</span> Go deep on them. <span class=GramE>Especially on
these two scumbags."</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>While the BATF went about their business, none of them
noticed that the second reporter to arrive had cut a slit in the back tire of
Agent Fleming's car. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Meanwhile, Daria bit her lip as she observed Agent Fleming's
mania. The BATF were none too gentle and she decided to get out of sight by
ducking into the ambulance and hoped that offered some protection. She breathed
a sigh of relief when the ambulance shut its door and both Morgendorffer
sisters were driven to the ER. While not hurt anywhere as bad as Quinn, Daria knew
she could use medical attention, too. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>About that time, the press arrived in force and a light
rain started. Agent Fleming hated the media and he frowned at the rain,
wondering briefly if spiritual forces were trying to ruin his investigation or
if maybe God Himself was crying over America's corruption unearthed this day. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He briefly considered having the reporters all endure a
cavity search, too. It would probably be just in its own way, but the BATF
couldn't afford to alienate the press too much. Seething, he decided to leave. "Let's
go, Bork!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Leaving instructions to trusted agents, Agents Fleming and
Bork got into their car and left. Traffic was building up as more cars
approached. Agent Fleming hoped the FBI didn't mess up too much evidence. One
of the few things the BATF and FBI agreed upon was that the local police would
be barred from the scene. That would no doubt create some problems. On the
other hand, Agent Burley was there for them, too, and they'd get their cavity
search all that much sooner. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Something else was bothering Agent Fleming, but he couldn't
figure out what it was. He knew he was frustrated when it came to Dallas
Grimes. She still hadn't been returned to justice and was at large out there.
While that dossier that was anonymously delivered to them by their informant
would be most useful, their anonymous informant had better come up with
something on Dallas Grimes soon or they'd focus on finding him. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Chief," said Agent Bork. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"What is it, Bork?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I think we may have a flat tire." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Fleming frowned. The Lawndale PD cops were going to
pay for his inconveniences tonight. <i>I mean for the crimes they partook in</i>,
he corrected himself. "Okay, Bork, let's get this tire changed before the rain
picks up." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>They were in a business district, with all the shops
closed for the day, but Agent Fleming determined they were safe enough. <i>As
long as no police officers arrive</i>, he reminded himself. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He supervised as Agent Bork expertly got the tire and jack
out and began to change the tire in admirable time. But he frowned and <span
class=GramE>squinted</span> his eyes as a car pulled over behind them, its
lights still on bright. Then a door opened a skinny guy in some kind of work
uniform stepped out and asked, "Hey, you guys need any help?" He looked back in
and answered the unseen passenger, "No, it will only take a minute. Come on if
you're bored and bring the cell phone. We may need to use it though." An
unhappy feminine voice came from the shotgun side. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Fleming relaxed. Two college kids from Middleton, no
doubt. As his girlfriend got out, wearing a hooded parka despite the rain being
very light, he told them, "It's no problem, but I thank you for stopping to
offer aid. It's a rare American these days who remember we are all fellow
countrymen." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Um, chief," said Agent Bork, still kneeling on the ground,
examining the tire he had just taken off. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"What is it, Bork?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I'm not sure," he said, "but I think this tire was
slashed." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Fleming's head whipped back up, his eyes
instinctively going open and getting even more blinded by the bright headlights.
He instinctively reached for his sidearm when the woman closed the distance all
too fast and two shots rang out. He heard nothing more. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Agent Bork was faster, although the situation had not yet
registered to his conscious mind. He stood, drew his gun, aimed at the woman
and fired just as Agent Fleming fell. But the woman was faster still. She
dropped to one knee just before Agent Bork fired. The young man behind the
woman dropped too, but Bork realized he hadn't been shot. He readjusted his aim
on the woman whom he instinctively knew to be more dangerous--this had to be
Dallas Grimes! He was sure of it intuitively--but before he could squeeze off
another round, a single shot created a blast of fire that turned into a long,
glowing tunnel that led him into eternity. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The woman screamed in excited victory and trotted over,
gun ready, to examine them. They both were very dead, and <span class=SpellE>Dara</span>,
also known as Dallas Grimes, decided not to waste another bullet on either of
them. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She trotted back to the car to see <span class=SpellE>UpSing</span>
riding shotgun. <span class=GramE>Smart boy.</span> She liked how he didn't
seem overburdened by a male ego that demanded to drive when she was the better
driver. She got in and they were quickly away. The police should be busy with
other matters and it would probably be several minutes before they realized two
more federal agents had been killed. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>Wild Card wanted me to expunge Cartwright since he was
about to be pinched by the feds, but I got who really mattered. Personally, I
hope Cartwright surviving in custody causes many people to sweat, though
someone else will probably off him. I only wish Wild Card could enjoy the
sweat, too. Okay, not really.</i> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She smiled, thinking about how she had also killed Wild
Card with a CO2 bomb hooked to his fuel tank, spiked with <span class=SpellE>RDX</span>.
The beauty of it was he had had these same materials in his car for personal
transport, too. He had died moments after he started his car. Ironically, the
Newport police and federal agents would be looking into the same criminal
empire that she and Wild Card had been running. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>And they might find what they were looking for, too, for
she had killed several makers of Ice Cold and firebombed their meth labs.
(Which was all too easy to do; she had to love the accelerants used to make the
stuff.) Several new labs would be uncovered this way. And they would find the
materials Wild Card both imported and exported and assume it was an accident or
it was one of his underlings seeking to move up in the world. Whichever alpha
tried to fill the sudden void in the leadership would no doubt be the one to go
down for what <span class=SpellE>Dara</span> herself had done. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>UpSing</span></span><span
class=postbody> stared. He'd known the plan, but it hadn't been REAL to him
until he watched it happen. And now <span class=SpellE>Dara</span> was smirking
gleefully. "Why?" he asked. He was a great hacker, but this blood in the street
was new to him. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Babe, they needed to be killed." Her voice was steely yet
seductive, and it sent a pleasant thrill through <span class=SpellE>UpSing</span>.
"I'm sorry to have involved you in this part of the job, but with Wild Card
dead, I had to get you out of Newport." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He'd known that Wild Card was dead, but suddenly he had to
know. "You killed him, didn't you?" He found he didn't care as much even if it
were true as he did that <span class=SpellE>Dara</span> cared enough to take
him out of Newport with her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You remember that file you downloaded on him. It proved
he was still working for the CIA, the dickhead. He told me we were working to
overthrow The Man, make the country safe for regular people, and get rich doing
it." <i>This wasn't my primary motivation, babe, but it should make you feel
better.</i> "But all the time he was working for the CIA and even trying to
help Bush become better accepted by the public. Our entire operation was a CIA
program called Operation Hobgoblin." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Operation Hobgoblin?" asked <span class=SpellE>UpSing</span>.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yeah," she said bitterly. "Can you <span class=GramE>believe,</span>
they have this program to create greater social instability in order to make
the American people approve a police state and the suspension of the
Constitution." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I thought that's what we have now," <span class=SpellE>UpSing</span>
replied. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Dara</span></span><span class=postbody>
snorted. <span class=GramE>"Too damn right."</span> She was glad <span
class=SpellE>UpSing</span> was taking this well. "But the CIA wanted more.
According to one report, government acceptance and control have been slipping
in many ways since the 60s. <span class=GramE>Too many people demanding their
constitutional rights.</span> Fearing anarchy--that is, someone besides them in
control-- they instituted Hobgoblin, managed in the field by our beloved Wild
Card. The plan was to assassinate certain politicians who resist
unconstitutional legislation, not that there are that many of them, and get a
few others in position to be blackmailed and controlled directly by the CIA. On
the street level, they were supplying drugs and weapons to increase gang
violence and general terrorism. This operation here in Lawndale was a tiny
breeze before the hurricane, the tip of the iceberg so to speak." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She right after meeting him (which was right after she
planted the bomb in his car), she confronted him about his continued
involvement with the CIA. He said he still intended to destroy the federal
government, including the CIA, and take over. <span class=SpellE>Dara</span>
would have a place at his side. <i>In other words, I'd be a prisoner of the
government again, and Wild Card is a lot smarter and more focused on me than
the current batch of idiots.</i> She hated doing it, but she did the federal
government a favor by killing Wild Card, as he was even worse. <i>And he might've
been lying anyway,</i> she added to herself. <i>He frequently did tell other
people exactly what they wanted to hear. Why not string me along, too?</i> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"And when the American public is living in terror of the
hobgoblins, they'll allow, no, demand, the government take care of them." <span
class=SpellE>UpSing</span> shook his head bemused. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yup," she replied, shaking off the memory of her last
meeting with Wild Card. "Office of Homeland Security steps in and restores
order. The plans for such a super agency are already drawn up." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Mencken was right," said <span class=SpellE>UpSing</span>.
"The practical aim of politics is to menace people with imaginary hobgoblins to
keep them clamoring for the government to protect them..." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"...As he was about the art and science of democracy being
the directing of the circus from the monkey cage," added <span class=SpellE>Dara</span>.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Locally, the CIA had planned to make Roger <span
class=SpellE>Fillman</span> mayor and then move him up in the world if he
proved effective. Like with <span class=GramE>herself</span>, the CIA had
caught <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> engaged in illicit activities. In his
case, it was tax evasion, fraud, cooking books, and even vile perversions he
shared with both the previous and current mayor of Lawndale. With their dossier
on him, he would make an excellent puppet. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>No chance of that now</i>, <span class=SpellE>Dara</span>
gloated. She had gotten a copy after breaking into one of Wild Card's personal <span
class=SpellE>safehouses</span> and stealing it and a few other items of
interest, right after he blew himself up. She'd sent copies of all the
information and evidence gathered on Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> to
the FBI, BATF, and even to the local DA who was investigating the police for
some reason. If that didn't do anything, she would have <span class=SpellE>UpSing</span>
send it to several key reporters and see if the media would hang him. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The CIA should have known better than to dare use <b>her</b>
as a puppet. This time, she not only cut her strings, but used those strings to
leave bruises on the puppet master's throat. She smiled again. The CIA would
have to find another way to scare the American people into supporting the idiot
son of the former head of the CIA. <i>Now there was the perfect puppet for them</i>,
she thought contemptuously. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So where are we going now?" <span class=SpellE>UpSing</span>
asked. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She'd picked him up before she left Newport. She'd known
she'd have to relocate him, and his most important toys were packed securely in
the trunk. She refused to acknowledge to herself that she was sweet on him,
just as he seemed to be not thinking about how he was getting used to the
violent ways in which she operated. "After a quick detour to Florida, we're
taking a vacation in my home state, Texas." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>UpSing</span></span><span
class=postbody> made a face. "Not Texas," he grumbled, "can't we go to
California? Please?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>She laughed. "But you'll like Texas computers. They have
the <span class=SpellE>unfriendliest</span> computers in the world. You can
hide so much more in them. At least try. <span class=GramE>If it doesn't work,
California is always there." <br>
<br>
"Awl right, honey <span class=SpellE>chil</span>'.</span> <span class=SpellE>Ah'll</span>
give '<span class=SpellE>er</span> a try." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody>Dara</span></span><span class=postbody>
thought his attempted accent was atrocious but she liked how cool and collected
he had been and was beginning to dare to hope that just maybe something
permanent could form between them. She'd have to watch him to make sure his
conscience wouldn't betray them, but if it didn't... well, she wouldn't ever
get married again, but she would grow fond of having him around. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>And as they drove to an unknown future, <span
class=SpellE><b>Queensryche</b></span> filled the car. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody><i>No time to rest yet </i></span><i><br>

<span class=postbody>------------------------------------------- </span><br>
<span class=postbody>04/19/01 THURSDAY 10:00 A.M. </span><br>
<span class=postbody>-------------------------------------------- </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>The</span></span><span class=postbody>
courtroom was packed. Quinn was sitting between Daria and Helen. She shouldn't
be out, but Helen wanted the judge, reporters, and public to see her battered
face. Though she did require stitches in her lip, the ER staff had been amazed
her jaw hadn't broken and that she did not have a concussion; her mother was
surprised how quickly her cuts were healing. She couldn't help but wonder if
Quinn had a guardian angel looking out for her. But she dismissed that as
nonsense. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria herself sported an obvious "shiner" on her face that
was painful to look at. Daria claimed to have rolled with the punch so that it
wasn't as bad as it could've been. But it was easy to miss when compared to
Quinn's injuries. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Whatever the case, she had sent pictures of Quinn and
Daria before the recent beatings to the media in hopes they would print <span
class=SpellE>pics</span> of before and after. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The courtroom was packed with local, national, and even
international reporters. Helen couldn't help but flinch and feel enraged every
time she looked to her youngest daughter's face, but she knew that every
picture taken of Quinn was helping and that she must keep her temper. She felt
both a sense of relief and pride to see Quinn bearing up so well despite her
vanity. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>On her other side was Ms. Morrison and Mrs. Kramer. Beyond
Mrs. Kramer was the private investigator named Earl Gentry. Helen felt a
tremendous debt of tearful gratitude to him; he had saved both her daughters'
lives and exposed a plot so twisted that even she hadn't suspected it. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. Morrison was on her feet, addressing the judge with
the reporters in mind. "In conclusion, Your Honor, as the former city attorney
and his colleagues, now arrested by federal authorities, fabricated all charges
but one against Daria Morgendorffer, and as she will soon be charged with that
one crime under federal statutes, I move that we dismiss all charges against
Daria Morgendorffer. By her actions, a school massacre was prevented. She has
done all of Lawndale a favor for which we can never repay her, and she may very
well still face years in a federal penitentiary for violation of the Gun Free
Zones Act and the Project Safe Neighborhoods, two violations that describe the
same act of bringing a gun onto school grounds, even under extenuating
circumstances. Likewise, as new evidence shows, Quinn Morgendorffer was the
target of a conspiracy that included the officer that charged her. I therefore
move that all charges against Quinn Morgendorffer also be dropped." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Judge Oliver cleared his throat and drank from a glass of
water as he surveyed his packed courtroom. He wondered if his hair was still
slicked down and tried to figure what response would get him the most positive
press. Maybe he should show clemency, pretty young girls, saving lives, and all
that. But then that could be seen as being soft, something no judge wanted a
reputation for. Besides, harsh convictions gained more press time for him. "Be
that as it may," he finally said, "but Daria and Quinn Morgendorffer have both
been accused of breaking local laws, too. I can't just throw that out of court,
even if I wanted to." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Ms. Morrison took a breath and continued. "Your Honor, the
federal government may have declared that trying defendants at the local level
and then subsequently at the federal level for the same crime is not double
jeopardy, but let us not fool ourselves. That is plainly false. Let Daria
Morgendorffer be prosecuted, only once, if twice over, by the Federal
Government for the one and only crime she may have committed." When Judge
Oliver looked as if he were about to turn her down one final time, she added, "Mrs.
Kramer assures me that there will be plenty of cases for this court to address
soon enough, and that this court will have all the publicity it could desire
without burdening the court further with Daria and Quinn Morgendorffer." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Judge Oliver frowned at that and looked to Mrs. Kramer.
His eyes opened a bit as he saw the file marked with a large X that Mrs. Kramer
had shown him earlier, implicating him, if only peripherally, with Roger <span
class=SpellE>Fillman's</span> crimes. The PI beside her made a motion like
taking a picture of him. Anger went through him, but so did fear. He would get
the DA back for this, but this was not the time, he concluded. "Well, this is
not standard protocol, Ms. Morrison, but this is not a standard situation. Very
well, since only one crime seems still to have been committed, by a one Daria
Morgendorffer, let the United States Government handle it at their level. Case
dismissed. I call recess for the next 10 minutes." He got up and stomped out of
there as gracefully as he could. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Helen was exuberant. She hugged Ms. Morrison in
overpowering gratitude and reached over and clasped her dear friend's hand
before turning around and hugging both of her daughters. Carefully, in mind of
Quinn's injuries, and distantly for Daria who sat on the other side of Quinn.
Getting both cases dismissed at once was more than she had dared to hope for. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Of course, there were other factors involved. Sergeant <span
class=SpellE>Lanny</span> in particular had turned in several documents and
aided Mrs. Kramer, Earl Gentry, and later the FBI, in investigating the
Lawndale PD. She was disgusted with her department, especially Warner. She had
to sue just to make sergeant and it was obvious she still had no respect, being
ordered about like a rookie by anyone with rank. She also knew Cartwright and
Corelli were bad news, and even aided in tapping their personal phone and computer.
She didn't care if this ruined her career. As far as she was concerned, she had
no career to begin with. It was said she was considering the FBI as a future
employer. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The two cops who had been on duty watching the
Morgendorffer house claimed they had a tip that Mr. Morgendorffer was to meet
with a criminal on behalf of his daughters. Jake never met anyone, though. He
had waited and waited outside the County Recording Office getting more and more
nervous and finally angry. He had returned home to find the living room
trashed, blood on the carpet, and both girls missing. Then Helen and Ms.
Morrison showed up, already foul tempered at the head games <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>
had played with them. Jake had not had a good night that night, but now the two
cops were being investigated by the FBI. At best, they were going to look
incompetent. They had already tendered their resignations, given the aloof
disdain and outright suspicion they both received from the rest of the
department. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Besides, there was the evidence gathered by Earl Gentry
that not only cleared the Morgendorffers and the Lanes, not to mention Mystik
Spiral, but also implicated many of the investigators and prosecutors of the
case. <i>Lawndale PD won't be the first police department to get a major
cleaning</i> Helen reminded herself, <i>and the cleaning won't stop me from
suing them.</i> The testimony of former officer Corelli, now under FBI
protection, would be particularly damning. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>On top of that were some files delivered to Mrs. Kramer by
courier that contained photos, documents, and video and audio footage of
Detective Cartwright, other officers, and Roger <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>Fillman</span></span><span class=GramE>.</span> The FBI and BATF
were both just as interested in who sent these documents as they were in what
the documents contained. There were even rumors that the CIA was investigating
the documents, but if they were, they were disguised as another agency. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>It was too soon to see what the aftereffects of this would
be, but at least Daria and Quinn were effectively cleared of all local charges.
But as ecstatic as Helen was, her enthusiasm was dampened by the knowledge that
the federal trial still loomed over her elder daughter, and the local case was
going to be a cake walk in comparison to that. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Marguerite," said Helen, her spirits still high despite
the looming federal trial, "do you want to celebrate with me and my daughters?"
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mrs. Kramer smiled wistfully. "Not right now. I have
something that really needs doing." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Can't it wait?" asked Helen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mrs. Kramer shook her head. "I need to interview Officer
Corelli one more time before he's whisked off for protective custody by the
FBI. I don't think I'll be DA much longer, even if I decide to run again. I
want to get as much of this into public record as I can before it's buried by
the powers that be. At the very least, I want to see if I can remove the local
rule against hiring cops with above average intelligence." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Later, then," said Helen with a sad but grateful smile on
her face. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yes, Helen, later," replied Mrs. Kramer. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>A few minutes later, Mrs. Kramer entered the secured room
that Officer Corelli was being held in. He smiled up at her ruefully when she
entered, with his bed arranged so that he was sitting up. He put down the paper
he was reading and asked her, "So how'd it go?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mrs. Kramer calmly replied, "It went better than we dared
to hope. Daria still has to face charges of violating two federal statutes, but
all local charges have been dismissed against Daria and Quinn both. The Lanes,
as well as that band everyone was buzzing about, are also in the clear." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So Mrs. Morgendorffer's going to sue the department?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The department and several news agencies," replied Mrs.
Kramer neutrally. She cleared her throat. "Officer--" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"<span class=GramE>It's</span> Mister Corelli now,"
interrupted <span class=SpellE>Correlli</span>. "I'm not a cop anymore. Even if
I could still be one I would resign." He shook his head. "And any cop would
spit in my face anyway." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mrs. Kramer nodded. Corelli was partially blamed for his
partner's death, even if he wasn't being charged in it, and he confessed to
working with Cartwright, perhaps the most hated cop in the country, and
certainly the most reviled by the Lawndale PD for the shame he stained them
with. She cleared her throat. "Mr. Corelli, do I have your permission to record
this interview?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He nodded, "Yes, I understand the need." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Thank you. Then let's begin. Do you have any idea who the
woman was that shot your partner?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He shook his head. "All I know is that she's called <span
class=SpellE>Dara</span>--or Dallas Grimes sometimes--and she worked for a man
claiming to be named Frank Lorenzo but commonly known as Wild Card. Him I do
know something about. He held a lot of influence with police and political
figures in Newport. Even in Washington DC, too. And he had enough influence to
sniff out undercover. He found me while I was working undercover for the
Newport PD, investigating a rash of homicides and rumors of a new form of
methamphetamines called Ice Cold on the street." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"And you don't know how he found out who you were?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No," said Corelli, "but I suspect it was my fingerprints.
He wore gloves all the time, which I thought was an effete habit <span
class=GramE>myself</span>, fearful of germs. But just before he found out who I
was, he handed me a beer from a fridge. The next day he knew who I was. I
surmised that he wore the gloves to keep his own prints off the bottle he
handed me and he took it to be examined for prints. As an officer of the law,
my prints are in a d-base that certain individuals have access to. Rumor has it
that he had contacts within the FBI that ran background checks on people for
him, but I don't know if this is true or not. Rumor also had it that he
personally killed at least one FBI agent, too." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I'm not interested in rumors in Newport and DC," replied
Mrs. Kramer. "I'll leave that to the FBI to investigate. What I want from you
is how you became involved in this, why you were in Lawndale, who that woman
was, and why innocent kids..." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"There's no such thing as innocence," interrupted Corelli.
Then he looked apologetic. "Sorry. That was the old me talking." When Mrs.
Kramer didn't say anything else, he went on. "As I said, I was working
undercover in Newport when Wild Card approached me all by himself and told me
who I was, even my badge number. I played it cool, which was a good thing,
because although I didn't know it at the time, <span class=SpellE>Dara</span>--that's
the woman the ATF calls Dallas Grimes--had me in her cross hairs. All it would've
taken to kill me was a signal from Wild Card. I guess in that regard I'm glad I
listened and agreed, because I wasn't ready to die yet." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mrs. Kramer nodded. "So what did he want you to do?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Mostly the same thing I was doing for the police
department, but to report to him as well. He had me falsify some reports to my
department. He also had me to cause the arrest of certain dealers and even one
man who turned out to be an undercover FBI agent. Then I called him to tell him
when they were being released. All of them were shot within a day of being
released from custody. I can only assume that <span class=SpellE>Dara</span>,
or Dallas, was involved in this." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I'm not interested in assumptions in Newport," said Mrs.
Kramer. "Please tell me how you came to Lawndale." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Corelli looked a little sheepish. "Wild Card somehow
managed to have me transferred. He told me he had arranged it the day before I
was officially told. The plan was to create a few <span class=SpellE>safehouses</span>
in unassuming locales in preparation for a wave of violence that would soon
overtake the urban areas. From these new bases of operations, Wild Card would
direct his empire." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"And you didn't have a problem with aiding in this?" asked
Mrs. Kramer. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Of course I did!" protested Corelli. "But he told me that
as a result there would be new police powers granted soon. This country needs
that, Mrs. Kramer. I'm sure you don't think much of me, but understand that
some of us think America needs a return to law and order! Civilians aren't
likely to understand what we see and what we put up with, but it's a needed
thing." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The end justifies the means," said Mrs. Kramer. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>His face reddened. "If the end is more law and order and
less violence and drugs overall, then it's worth taking a step backwards in
order to take a leap forward. And besides, this country had just gotten rid of
that immoral adulterer Clinton, and we had a MORAL president in. Yet this
country doesn't respect him! They say he stole the election! How can this
country have any law, order, and decency if even the President of the United
States isn't respected? I know Bush isn't perfect, but he's a lot more moral
than Clinton or Gore, he's harsh on criminals and defends the unborn! America NEEDS
Bush and it NEEDS law and order." He bit his lip then. "I admit I made a
mistake by throwing in with Wild Card--I didn't even know how much was truth and
how much was bullshit from him--but I had good intentions. Please believe that."
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mrs. Kramer said nothing for a moment, and then nodded. "So
you thought it was mostly criminals that would be hurt in this operation, and
as a result of the backlash, America would become more moral and law abiding?"
When he nodded weakly, she added, "Please state your answer." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yes," said Corelli. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Okay, so you came to Lawndale..." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"It took awhile all the same, but I came to Lawndale about
the same time as Cartwright from D.C. That was when the department got the new
funding and hired a dozen new officers to combat the rising crime rate,
particularly the crash and dash robberies." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mrs. Kramer nodded. It was odd that those robberies
stopped the moment the new police arrived. She'd thought it was unlikely that a
dozen new cops had stopped it. And some of the places hit, like the coffee
house for the students at Lawndale High, didn't make any sense. "Do you think
those robberies were staged here as an excuse to bring you?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Corelli shrugged. "If you're interested in my assumptions
then I'd say yes. But I don't really know." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Tell me about the Morgendorffers, the Lanes, Matthew
Foster and Scott Rhodes, and the band Mystik Spiral." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mr. Corelli grimaced. "We were trying to find a way to
take out the local meth dealers. <span class=GramE>Both as Lawndale PD and as
per instructions of Wild Card.</span> The method wasn't important, only that it
happened. But Wild Card also wanted a smoke screen to allow new dealers to come
in. I didn't like that, but he insisted he had good reasons that he couldn't
tell me yet. And Wild Card apparently has a little influence with Mayor Grant,
but not as much as he has with <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>. He wanted
Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> to be mayor, but until then some
discretion had to be observed." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Go on," said Mrs. Kramer, when he paused in his telling. "How
did the kids fit into this?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He shook his head a little. "Matthew Foster wasn't
important enough to anyone. He was a small fish. He frustrated Detective Warner
because he couldn't be caught and made him, and the department, look like
fools. Warner does NOT like looking like a fool. When Daria Morgendorffer
called 911 to report him, it was a godsend." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"But why entrap Daria?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"That came later. After the interrogation and the reports
that I assume you've seen, it looked to Detective Warner like the Morgendorffer
girls were involved. It also looked like the Sloanes were involved, and the
prospect of busting them was too glorious a target for him to turn down. It
would not only mean a huge windfall for the department as we confiscated the
Sloane estates and more funding from the government, but he would make a name
for himself. He has a massive inferiority complex. And Roger <span
class=SpellE>Fillman</span> approved of his obsession and told us to string him
along in the direction he was already heading." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Because?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Because the people involved--Daria, Jane, Quinn, Mystik
Spiral--would take the fall for the coming surgical strike that would take out
Evil Eddie. <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> was to lure Mrs. Morgendorffer
out, <span class=GramE>then</span> the father would be lured out on some
context. The police assigned to the house would follow him and call in a
replacement. The one nearest would be Cartwright, who would oversee the
extraction of the girls. Later he was to act surprised that they weren't home.
It was to appear that the girls had arranged for their father to leave and
snuck out the moment <span class=GramE>he</span>, and the police, were gone.
But there was nothing in the plan about putting out APBs on anyone. I don't
know what went wrong." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"And what was this suppose to accomplish?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Their remaining associates, some being at least somewhat
shady, would take the rest of the fall. The police would also focus on the
Sloanes, but they didn't dare make a move without definitive proof. The Sloanes
are so well protected with lawyers and even representatives that it would
become a stalemate. And everyone would be so busy facing each other down that
they wouldn't see the new players until Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>
was mayor. Once <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> hired and fired the police,
there was going to be a lot more of Wild Card's crew coming in to 'combat the
rising drug violence' and other officers going out for incompetence. Then the
matter would be settled quietly." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mrs. Kramer blinked at that. She had suspected a lot of
this from the beginning, but she had failed to guess what kind of worm Roger <span
class=SpellE>Fillman</span> was! </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So you knew," said Mrs. Kramer, trying to keep the anger
from her voice, "that innocent kids were going to be killed or sent to prison,
and innocent names would be smeared in this operation for the benefit of <span
class=SpellE>Fillman</span> and Wild Card, whom you think are more moral than
the rest of America?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Corelli's face reddened again and his voice dropped. "I'm
sorry. I know how bad it must look from your point of view. And I'm ashamed of
the things I did, okay? But by this time, I was too deeply involved..." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"And a user of Ice Cold, weren't you?" asked Mrs. Kramer
rhetorically and a little accusingly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He nodded. "The stress..." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Look, I'm sorry for my anger. The Morgendorffers in
particular are close friends of mine. It's not my place to judge you, only to
get the facts. And," she added pointedly, "to bring the guilty to justice. I'm
sure you can appreciate that." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He nodded. "I don't want any plea bargains. I've made my
peace with God and I throw myself on the mercy of any court. I know I messed up
and I'm willing to pay for my crimes. In fact, I insist upon it." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Why did this <span class=SpellE>Dara</span>, or Dallas
Grimes, shoot your partner?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Corelli shook his head. "Officer <span class=SpellE>Delancey</span>
was a local, but one who had some unfortunate vices. I helped entrap him for
Wild Card. In order for us to have mutual silence, he did Ice Cold with me and
came to love it almost as much as I did. He was a good cop, though, just weak.
And I threatened to ruin his career and his family if he didn't do the Ice Cold
and help me, and by extension, Wild Card and <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>."
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"And this is why he was murdered?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No, no," said Corelli. "He was murdered because he was a
good cop. He knew he was supposed to ignore <span class=SpellE>Dara</span>. Not
that he knew anything about her. I simply gave him his orders and he was
supposed to obey because I could destroy his life if he didn't. We were going
to say that we didn't see anything significant. We just wanted to see what they
would do for later and then we would follow her. That was the plan." He
stopped, his voice wavering. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>After a minute, Mrs. Kramer added, "But something went
wrong." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Corelli nodded very sadly. "<span class=SpellE>Dara</span>
attacked two boys without provocation. He insisted we get involved, but I
stopped him with threats and even restraint. I had him, but then Daria
Morgendorffer and Jane Lane ran outside and <span class=SpellE>Dara</span>
pulled a gun on them." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"And your partner did the chivalrous thing and tried to
help?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I couldn't stop him," he said sadly. "I got out and tried
to chase him down, but <span class=SpellE>Dara</span>... she just turned and
shot him. The bitch shot him. And then she shot me." When silence followed, he
added, "and then Daria, whom we were setting up, came and helped me. <span
class=SpellE>Dara</span> shot me and killed my partner and Daria saved my life.
That's when... I had a change of heart." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>After an uncomfortable silence, Mrs. Kramer said, "Do you
know why this woman shot and killed Agents Fleming and Bork?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You know it was her?" asked Corelli. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Ballistics <span class=GramE>are</span> the same as for <span
class=SpellE>Delancey</span>," said Mrs. Kramer. "But some believe that she
WANTS us to know it was she who killed them. According to the reports I've
read, she's a sociopath with a hatred for authority. I understand some of her
crimes are so serious that people like you and me aren't even allowed to know
about them." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Huh," he said. "Someone said she worked for Evergreen Air
for awhile." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mrs. Kramer's eyes widened. <span class=GramE>"That
thinly-covered CIA front?</span> Even I can't believe she was ever CIA." She
shook her head. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Me neither," replied Corelli, "it's just a rumor." He
shook his head and continued, "I don't know why she shot them." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Some say she shot them out of revenge. Apparently, Agents
Fleming and Bork were responsible for her arrest before she managed to get out
of prison. The details of that are still unclear." When he stared at her, she
added, "But others think it was because he had just arrested Cartwright and
Warner." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Corelli shook his head. "Cartwright was with us, but not
Warner. Warner was just a local idiot who had dreams of doing something to
impress us and the world. I'm not saying he's all innocence and light, but he
thought he was fighting the good fight against the forces of evil anarchy." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So did you," added Mrs. Kramer sardonically. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"There is that," he replied regretfully. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Do you remember the woman Detective Cartwright shot on
the night of the massacre of Evil Eddie's men?" When Corelli nodded, she went
on, "She was undercover for the FBI. They have audio footage of her trying to
surrender peaceably when Detective Cartwright shot her the first time. The
footage cuts off before the final shot that ended her life. But this is how
Cartwright was fighting evil anarchy. <span class=GramE>By dispatching federal
agents that got in his way."</span> <i>It's unlikely he knew that</i>, she
thought silently, <i>but her life was no more valuable as a FBI agent than as a
civilian. At least this let's him see the kind of people he was mixed up with.</i>
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"God," he croaked, "forgive me." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Do you have any idea why Mrs. Brand of Handgun Control
Inc. was murdered?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Corelli nodded. "I have a good idea. She had announced she
was running for mayor of Lawndale. While she wasn't a perfect human being, she
was not possessed of the same vices as <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span> and
the other candidates. She stood a good chance at winning the respect of
Lawndale and the voters, despite her ardent focus on gun control. She even
promised to support our department..." After a moment, he added, "Cartwright
said Mrs. Brand bit off more than she could chew by challenging <span
class=SpellE>Fillman</span> that way. It doesn't take a genius to figure out
that Mrs. Brand was murdered because she was a real threat to <span
class=SpellE>Fillman</span> making mayor of Lawndale." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mrs. Kramer blinked at how casually he said all this.
Finally, she said, "I want to thank you for being candid with me, Mr. Corelli.
But you need your rest and I need to run what you've said through the gears of
the system. I'm sure we'll be talking again, soon." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I'm not so sure," he replied. "I'm being shipped to
Washington DC under protective custody tonight." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mrs. Kramer sighed. "I'll come back myself in a few hours
then or send Mr. Earl Gentry to get final comments. After that, I may just
depend on your confessions to the FBI. But understand that I will likely press
charges against you, if for no other reason to get your testimony in court." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I understand, Mrs. Kramer. And I'm sorry." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mrs. Kramer shook her head. In truth, she would likely be
blackballed out of office by 2002, and she didn't know if she had the will to
fight it any more. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The system made her feel dirty. Already, several agencies
were doing damage control in order to squash the reports. Within a few months,
the events in Lawndale would be just another footnote which only a few people
remembered. In a few years, almost everyone who wasn't involved would have
forgotten about it. To do anything less would be to turn scrutiny on everyone
else, and the first rule in government was cover your own ass. Mrs. Kramer was
going to blow the whistle, and whistle blowers just didn't last. But she would
do what she could before she was out of a job. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I'm sorry, too," she said in a cool tone that caused
Corelli to blink. She left then and wondered if Helen would be interested in
opening a private law office with her in a couple of years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=postbody>---------------------------------------- </span><br>
<span class=postbody>02/05/02 TUESDAY 2:30 P.M. </span><br>
<span class=postbody>----------------------------------------- </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The federal trial was finally down to closing statements.
Daria's insides clenched as she listened to the prosecutor's deep voice,
ringing with authority. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You have heard the feminist case that to let Daria
Morgendorffer off is a strike against stalkers and male violence. Do not be
deceived. What you have heard is the wild-west-vigilante shoot-<span
class=SpellE>em</span>-ups come to her defense. Even the NRA has pulled back
from backing Daria Morgendorffer. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Consider that even here, in federal court, Daria
Morgendorffer has refused to reveal where she got her gun--unless you want to
believe the unlikely story that she got it from a gun show. It is obvious that
Daria Morgendorffer is involved with some shady characters, one of whom
supplied her with a gun for the express purpose of taking human life. Perhaps
Daria Morgendorffer acted as a vigilante, honestly trying to aid her sister.
Perhaps, as may seem more probable, she saw Matthew Foster as competition in an
illegal but highly lucrative field. In either case, whatever her motivation, it
is undeniable that Daria Morgendorffer knowingly and willfully broke the law. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The defense would have you believe that there were
extenuating circumstances. They play to your sympathy in a bid for leniency.
But I submit to you that to grant leniency in such a case is to encourage
lawlessness and anarchy. This is exactly what we are here to prevent. People
MUST respect the law or there is no safety or security for <b>anyone</b>. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The evidence is clear: the defendant broke the law. It is
immaterial if she had extenuating circumstances. The law in this case does not
allow for circumstances. As jurors, you must judge according to the facts of
the case, and that fact is, Miss Morgendorffer broke the law. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You have seen the video. You have heard the defendant's
own testimony. The judge has informed you that you may only judge the facts of
the case and not the law itself. This case is self-evident and this trial is a
waste of the taxpayers' money. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"It is your duty, as jurors, to decide if the law was
broken. If it was, and the defendant herself says it was, then you MUST
convict. This is your duty and your responsibility before God and man." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria's stomach twisted in fear. She knew the prosecutor
was right: she <b>had</b> broken the law. She hoped that the wild gambit she
and her defense team had come up with would work. Otherwise, she was going to
prison for a long, long time. Unfortunately, she wasn't a big believer in
either the benevolence or the intelligence of her fellow human beings. The
prosecution, with the aid of the BATF, had also shown holes in Daria's story of
buying the gun at a gun show and Daria wasn't surprised: It <b>was</b> a lie. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The lawyer for the defense stepped forward. She met the
eyes of each of the jurors; they looked back soberly. She seemed so calm and
self-<span class=GramE>assured,</span> Daria's stomach quieted a little. Maybe,
maybe there was hope. Daria was hoping so hard that she missed the opening
words of Ms. Morrison's final summary. Taking a deep breath, she forced herself
to listen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"... The jury, not the judge, is the final arbiter of both
the facts <b>and</b> the law. That means you, the jury, have the right and the
duty to judge the law as well as the facts. If you are on a jury, and if you
think the law is stupid, unfair, unjust, or misapplied, it is your right and
your duty to acquit. It's an ancient right, older than America. It was included
in our form of government because United States law was never meant to be
imposed on us, its citizens, against our will. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"That is why the jury system is essential. It ensures that
we live in a free country rather than a dictatorship. It is this system that
demands that the <b>law respect the people</b> or the law forfeits its right to
exist. This is what protects our liberties as surely as any soldier. This
guarantees us that we live in a free country rather than a tyrannical police
state. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The opponents of jury nullification would have you
believe that free juries will lead to anarchy. However, jury nullification has
been around a thousand years and hasn't created anarchy yet. It has, in fact,
led instead to the freedom of religion and to the end of Prohibition. Jack
Kevorkian has been exonerated three times due to jury nullification. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Some judges and lawyers cite <span class=SpellE><i>Marbury</i></span><i>
v. Madison</i>, a 19th century case in which the Supreme Court finally gave
itself the authority to override the People. However, this ruling was overruled
in 1920, <span class=GramE><i>Homing</i></span><i> v. District of Columbia, 138</i>,
when Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. presided. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Lord Denham stated, in <i>O'Connell v <span class=GramE>Rex<span
style='font-style:normal'>, that</span></span></i> 'every jury in the land is
tampered with and falsely instructed by the judge when it is told that it must
accept as the law that which has been given to them, or that they can decide
only the facts of the case.' In the <i>U.S. v Moylan</i>, 1969, the 4th Circuit
Court of Appeals also concluded that 'if the jury feels the law is unjust, we
recognize the undisputed power of the jury to acquit, even if its verdict is
contrary to the law as given by the judge, and contrary to the evidence.' </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"John Adams stated just as bluntly that it was 'not only a
juror's right, but his duty, to find the verdict according to his own best
understanding, judgment, and conscience, though in direct opposition to the
direction of the court.' <span class=SpellE>H.H</span>. Bancroft in <i>History
of the Constitution</i> eloquently states: 'If the juror accepts as the law
that which the judge states, then that juror has accepted the exercise of
absolute authority of a government employee and has surrendered a power and a
right that once was a citizen's safeguard of liberty.' </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I ask you to remember this, your sacred duty, when
judging this case. The law would condemn Daria Morgendorffer to years in prison
and to a record that will haunt her for the rest of her life, because of the
method she used to save the life of several school children. Ask yourselves and
your conscience: In this case are law and justice one and the same? And if you
believe they are not, then you have to ask, which is more important? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"This is how you're <span class=GramE>free,</span> this is
how you tell your government when it's wrong. Because of high acquittal rate in
prohibition cases in the 1920s and early 1930s, the prohibition laws could not
be enforced. Because they could not be enforced, they were repealed. Because
prohibition was ended, the gangs and street warfare caused by prohibition were
effectively ended until the new war on drugs rose up. Jury nullification is, in
effect, what keeps anarchy in check and the people free from the demands of the
strong. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The Project Safe Neighborhoods and Gun Free Zones Act
were intended to stop the Matthew Fosters of society. They failed. Should these
laws now punish Daria Morgendorffer? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"She was enduring horrifying, life-threatening
circumstances. By breaking the law she saved an unknown number of classmates
and teachers from the gun of a crazed killer. She had called 911 previously,
the first time Matthew Foster threatened her and her sister--and the police had
released him. Should she have called 911 <b>again</b> at Lawndale High on the
morning of the shooting? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Ask yourself, was this law intended to convict a
terrified young woman protecting her younger sister? Or was it intended to
protect her from homicidal stalkers? Will convicting Daria under this law make
our neighborhoods safer for us, or safer for the Matthew Fosters among us? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Daria Morgendorffer is essentially throwing herself on
the mercy of this jury, asking only that you answer these questions for
yourself: Do you see a difference between Daria Morgendorffer's use of a gun
and Matthew Foster's? Do you believe her act was done with the same evil,
antisocial intent as his? Do you believe she should go to prison for saving the
lives he would have destroyed? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Finally, she asks that you ask yourself one question--which
is more important: Justice, or the Law? </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The prosecution would have you believe you are not
competent to decide these questions. The Constitution of the United States says
that you are and demands that you do." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria closed her eyes. Ms. Morrison presented well, but
this strategy was a wild gamble. Technically, Daria had broken the law and
there was no way around that, except to remind jurors that they could judge the
law as well as the defendant. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>One fear is that most jurors had been educated in a public
school, and this rendered them particularly prone to "argument by authority,"
making this gambit a risky move. But reminding the jurors that past
authorities, and many modern ones, backed their right to think for themselves
might unexpectedly turn this in their favor. Truthfully, it was Daria's only
hope of avoiding prison, given that she had undeniably violated federal law. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The prosecution, nervous at this gambit, had pulled in
many self-proclaimed experts from anti-gun groups. The NRA had provided a
witness to the defense to rebut the prosecution's "expert testimony"--they
couldn't let a case this big go down without getting some media exposure from
it--but that was all. Other than that, Daria had had only character witnesses
included Mr. DeMartino, Ms. Barch, Michael Jordan MacKenzie, the Landons, and
(Daria sighed) Kevin Thompson. "Can't beat the QB for a character reference," she'd
muttered under her breath. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>It had been a wild gamble, and whether it succeeded or not
would depend on what kind of people were on the jury more than it had on the
lawyers and experts and character witnesses. Daria caught herself biting her
lip and stopped. Now came the worse part: The waiting as the jury deliberated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=postbody>-------------------------------------------------- </span><br>
<span class=postbody>04/19/02 FRIDAY 5:00 P.M. </span><br>
<span class=postbody>-------------------------------------------------- </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria knew she had to do it. She knocked on the door of
the man who had sold her the gun, the pouch and belt she carried it in, the <span
class=SpellE>JHP</span> ammunition, and everything she needed to clean and care
for her gun. He had also taught her to how to shoot. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The gun dealer opened the door and his eyes widened, and
then he quickly looked around. Before Daria could say anything, he opened the
door wider and motioned her in. He closed the door behind him, facing Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Here," said Daria, handing him five $20s. "I haven't
forgotten that I owe you. With the legal fees and all, our finances have been
strained, and I didn't dare bring over even what I had while I was being
watched." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Put your money away, Daria, you've already paid me back
many times over with your actions." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Huh?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"The lives you saved, Daria. You may have even saved my
own when it comes down to it." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria blushed and put the money back in her jacket pocket.
"I wanted to thank you again..." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Don't mention it, Daria. PLEASE don't mention it, EVER." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>They shared a companionable laugh and went into the
kitchen where the man was fixing a meal that smelled like chicken. A very Cajun
sauce simmered on the stove. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Have a soda, Daria," he invited. She accepted his offer
and grabbed an Ultra Cola from his fridge. Then, from force of habit, she
crossed to the window and checked the street. Her shoulders were tense and her
hand clenched her Ultra. She relaxed herself with an act of will as she took a sip.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I heard the good news," the man rumbled, as he began to
stir something in a pan on the stove. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yeah," said Daria. "It was rough, but I guess you knew
that." She crossed her arms without putting her Ultra down. "The prosecution
managed to keep anyone who had kids going to Lawndale High off the jury since
they might be too sympathetic to me. They also attempted to keep out the part
where I had called the police before and that the police had released Matthew
in an attempt to entrap me, but that failed. Seems evidence of that got out to
the reporters somehow."</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The man shook his head, grumbling slightly. In truth,
Marguerite Kramer had released the facts and the evidence to back it once she
learned what the feds were trying to do and before the jury selection had been
completed. Since she was prosecuting Roger <span class=SpellE>Fillman</span>
herself, it wasn't something she could be arrested for. But all the same, her days
as a prosecutor were limited. Whistle blowers did not last and Marguerite was
no longer seen as a "team player." She couldn't be trusted not to turn on other
political figures. She helped Daria more than Daria liked to think about and
she was indebted to her. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"In the end," said Daria after a pause, "the jury didn't
care about Handgun Control Inc.--that is, the Brady Campaign, as they call
themselves now--or the NRA. They looked at how the law affected them personally
and decided on that rather than how it affected some special interest group." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You were almost convicted anyway," the man reminded her
softly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"True," replied Daria. "Only four voted to acquit, and
they were actually jailed for it." The man knew that of course. "One gave in,
but the other three stood firm. When the media started getting more interested
again as they languished in a cell, I was acquitted." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"HA! The government was scared of jury nullification
becoming common knowledge and wanted the trial brought to a close, even if it
meant cutting you loose." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"That," replied Daria, "and that this case reveals just
how corruptible the honorable politicians and police officers are." She shook
her head a bit as she added, "Everyone seems more worried about foreigners
right now anyway." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The man turned to her and smiled in a way that was both
friendly and yet cynical. <span class=GramE>"So history repeats itself.</span>
At least this time the good guys won." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria blinked. "Are you sure of that?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Would you rather that all the special interest groups and
their pocket politicians push for more victim disarmament and make even more of
the STUPID laws that leave victims defenseless for the next would-be mass
murderer, Daria?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria snorted. "Irony can be ugly sometimes," she
conceded, especially as she didn't want to alienate him after he had risked so
much to help her. But she wondered about the blind spots in his reality tunnel.
She decided to ask, "But don't you ever wonder if one of the guns you ever sold
was used by someone like Matthew?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He sighed. "Yes, SOMETIMES," he admitted grudgingly. "But
I am careful, and try to show a LITTLE sense. If you want to see real crime and
anarchy, wait until the bozos in power send out their storm troopers to collect
all the registered weapons. Those I sell to, which include older ladies and
gents unlikely to harm anyone in anything but life threatening circumstances,
don't want their guns known or recorded to be taken away by people who command
the most guns. You know how criminals become bolder and how the government, in
cracking down on crime, ends up becoming a bigger threat than the criminals, if
it wasn't already. You know the history about THAT, don't you, Daria?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I do," Daria admitted, "and I see your point. But I can't
help but think the gun culture is crazy, too." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The man shook his head. "The NRA representatives that took
advantage of this situation for their own political agendas are crazy, Daria.
They often support the measures they claim to oppose just so they have an
emergency to fight. Did you know that the NRA basically accepted the Gun Free
Zones Act and Project Safe Neighborhoods that they were fighting THIS time?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No," said Daria. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"They were, Daria." The man scowled as he continued. "As
long as they have something to fight, then people will give their support and
their money. I'm about to give up on them completely. They give in time and
time again and yet try to scare me every month with demands that I send them
more money. The organization prospers and is valuable to politicians as a
result of all that money and support. I still support the Virginia Citizens
Defense League, but I just don't feel confident in the NRA anymore." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria blinked at that. She recalled that the NRA and <span
class=SpellE>HCI</span> worked together on something in Colorado just recently.
Wayne La Pierre, a major figure, even shook hands with a <span class=SpellE>HCI</span>
rep on the NRA site and proudly proclaimed that if you touch certain guns you
would go to prison. In some states, <span class=GramE>gun owners with no
criminal record have to be registered for life, while even a convicted
murderer, once he's served his time and is</span> off parole, doesn't have to
register with the system. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You're saying," <span class=GramE>said</span> Daria
slowly, "that they helped to create the very problems that they fight because
it's their <b>meal ticket</b>?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The man made an impressed sound. <span class=GramE>"VERY
good, Daria.</span> The gun grabbers are made up of the same types of folk, at
the top levels of management, and they work with their opposite numbers more
often than the followers of either side really know." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria nodded. "I can see that. I noticed how both Mrs.
Brand of <span class=SpellE>HCI</span> and Mr. Alexander of the NRA <span
class=GramE>were</span> using the tragedies for their own political ends. They
didn't care about what they were fighting for at all, just in scaring the
voters to vote for them and the candidates that they favored." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"There's a lot of deal making between organization leaders
and politicians, too, Daria," the man continued. "But go to a target range, go
to some gun shows, and you'll find many sensible people that you would never
guess were gun owners if you ever met them anywhere else. THAT'S the gun
culture. Many are sensible women like yourself, so mind your manners." He
smiled that friendly yet harsh smile at her again. "Though if the idiots DO
manage to outlaw guns, they'll make me filthy rich, so maybe I should hope they
do it." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria blinked and smiled momentarily over that, though the
smile didn't touch her eyes. "Mencken described that situation in his essay, <i>The
<span class=SpellE>Uplifters</span> Try It Again</i>. I never understood why
people think gun control is going to work when vehement drug control has
completely failed in prohibiting drugs. Even convicts in maximum security
prisons sometimes got a hold of cocaine and meth. If anything, laws have made
drugs more popular, more harmful, and more profitable for criminals." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"People just aren't smart, Daria, and they don't learn
from history. The world is full of idiots ruled by idiots who work hard to
please idiots and think they're making the world better instead of worse." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I'm just hoping we're not another breed of idiots." They
were quiet for a moment, and then Daria took another drink and added, "Lawndale
is getting rid of the 'average intelligence' requirement for its police
officers," she said. "So at least maybe the new cops will be brighter." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Ever the optimist," the man replied, grinning broadly,
which caused Daria to grin back just a little. Then he frowned. "They'll have
to hire outside of Lawndale then. <span class=GramE>Unless YOU want to become a
cop, Daria."</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria actually laughed briefly. "No, I don't think so."
She frowned. "Maybe I did the right thing, but..." Daria trailed off, not
knowing how to share the insecurity she felt, or how she wondered what kind of
person she was to be able to take a life like that. Sure she cried and pulled
her own hair AFTER the fact, but she had felt nothing when she had gotten the
gun, learned to use it, and then used it to kill Matthew. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Daria," the man interrupted, "I want to thank you, <span
class=GramE>for</span> restoring the glimmer of hope I have in humanity. You
asked intelligent questions, you had the sense to bring gloves for everyone and
to use Teflon, and as I expected, you were an excellent student!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Thanks." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No thanks required, Daria, for something you earned. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>"Most of all, you showed courage,
ethics, and resilience when you saved your sister's life, and who knows how
many other lives.</span></span><span class=postbody> I expected you to break or
be tricked into revealing who I was. I kept expecting an 'official visit' from
our government, but the ski-masked Gestapo we have running amok in this country
never did break down my door at 4 am to shoot me in my bed. You are all too
rare, Daria, in intelligence and integrity both." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria blushed at this. "I'm not sure if I deserve thanks.
I solved my problem with a gun in the end. Maybe my intentions were better, but
I still sank to his level." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Mr. DeMartino saw that Daria was still wracked with guilt
and self-doubt, and moved to put an end to that demon. "No, Daria, you did NOT.
Your heart is filled with compassion for the people around you. Matthew Foster's
heart was filled with hatred for those around him. He went to Lawndale High to
kill, you went there to save. Matthew's intent was to take lives. Yours was to
save lives." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I don't..." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Don't interrupt me! As I was saying, there is your
difference right there. You did not sink to his level, and I don't think you
are capable of doing such! The difference between you and Matthew is the love,
honor, and integrity in your heart. Likewise, Matthew didn't face the guilt and
soul searching that you faced. You were a defender who saved lives while he was
simply a crazed killer who wanted to destroy lives. That's where you're
different. Guns are nothing more than tools used by people with the will either
to help or to harm. The intentions are in the user, not the gun itself. To
compare yourself to Matthew is like comparing the noble knight and rescuer to
the robber who murders the drunk for his petty change." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"<span class=SpellE>Hmph</span>. I don't know if I'm
really noble..." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"But I do, Daria. And I long suspected it, which is why I
gave you and your friends a good deal, and spent time each day taking you out
to my place in the woods to teach you how to shoot. You are a good person,
Daria, and I saw arming you as a good thing to do." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Why?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You have to ask why? Well, let ME ask YOU a couple of
questions, Daria." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Um, okay," said Daria, curious. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Who was it that said, 'Where the choice is between only
violence and cowardice, I would advise violence'?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"That would be Mahatma Gandhi." She smiled a bit,
remembering how a certain teacher had once said her knowledge of history was
suspicious. "In <i>Gandhi, <span class=GramE>An</span> Autobiography</i>, he
also stated that, 'Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India,
history will look upon the act of depriving a whole nation of arms, as the
blackest.' That's on page 446. I photocopied it. I'll do another copy for you
if you want." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The man chuckled. "Very good, Daria, I'm impressed! But I
don't need a copy, thank you very much. I have the entire book myself. Now,
tell me who said, 'Though defensive violence will always be a sad necessity in
the eyes of men of principle, it would be still more unfortunate if wrongdoers
should dominate just men.'?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I'm not sure on that one. Like the saying, though." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"YOU, Daria, don't KNOW something?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Hey," said Daria, stung, "don't rub it in." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He chuckled. "It was St. Augustine, and while the man may
have had a few problems, I want you to burn those words of his I just quoted
into your heart." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria looked up at him. "Who was it said, 'A fear of
weapons is a sign of retarded sexual and emotional maturity'?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Oh, PLEASE," said the man. "I never heard that before,
but that is OBVIOUSLY Sigmund Freud." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Ah," said Daria, "But where did he say it?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"What? Oh, damn... I... don't... know... happy?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Very." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So where did he say it?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria smirked, "<i>General Introduction to Psychoanalysis</i>."
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Well, Daria," said the man while grumbling a little bit, "can
you see that these sayings might hold a gem of real truth?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"<span class=SpellE>Hmph</span>," said Daria, "you're
saying that it is an unfortunate world when people like Matthew can have access
to guns, but the world will be that much worse when people like me don't have
the same access?" When he continued to stare at her, she continued with, "Because
in a world where only the Matthews are armed with guns and the rest of us
eschew them, then we live in a world where the Matthews are the ones empowered,
and everyone else is just a victim waiting to happen." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Very good, Daria! Do you understand now why I agreed to
arm you, and why I don't regret it?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria thought a minute. "Yes, I guess I do. Um, thanks.
But I know you have bills to pay and..." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Daria, don't worry about it! I admit my day job doesn't
pay much BEYOND frustration, but my selling guns at gun shows and giving
private lessons more than makes up for it! So you run along and know that I
didn't give you anything, for you paid me back many times over. It is I who
thank you, Daria." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Okay, then," said Daria truly touched. "Maybe when things
cool down a bit, I'll be back for another gun, and some more lessons." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I look forward to it, Daria." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Well, I need to meet Jane so we can go to Pizza King in
just a few minutes, so I better go." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>He smiled at her as he opened the door. "Good BYE, then,
Daria." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Good-bye, Mr. DeMartino." Daria took off, walking
briskly. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You go, girlfriend!" he said, and shut the door after
Daria raised her hand in one last farewell and kept walking to meet Jane at
Casa Lane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=postbody>------------------------------------ </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The <i>Sick, Sad World</i> logo was replaced by two
10-year old girls looking a lot like a younger Daria and Jane playing
hopscotch. A fatter version of Detective Warner suddenly leaped out with a
snarl and picked up both girls, one in each hand. Terrified mothers in the
background grabbed their own kids and screamed while Detective Warner ran off
with a bawling Jane and Daria in each hand. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>A woman in a power suit, obviously supposed to be a thin
Helen Morgendorffer, screamed after him, "STOP! Bring back my baby!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The scene changed to an interrogation room where little
Daria and Jane are back to back in two chairs, tied up together with rope. A
few red balloons float over their heads. Warner is smoking a cigar while the
children cry softly. "All right, you punks, where's the stash!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I don't know!" shouts little Jane. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"That's it!" Warner sticks cigar to a balloon, causing it
to pop. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"<span class=SpellE>Waaaaah</span>!" screams little Jane </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I want my mom!" screams little Daria </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"If you ever wanna see your mom again," shouts Detective
Warner, "you'll tell me where the cocaine is!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Now little Daria and Jane are both crying up a storm. A
door opened to let a shaking, nervous Cartwright come in with a red nose and
sniffling. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You!" shouts Warner, "help me with the drug kingpins!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The Sick, Sad World logo comes back. <span class=GramE>"<b>Defectives</b>
Warner and Cartwright, Lawndale PD, next on Sick, Sad World!"</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria and Jane looked at the show wide-eyed in Jane's
room. Finally, Jane picked up the remote. "Want me to turn it off, amiga?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No," said Daria, "at least it's not me they're talking
about anymore. I just wish I hadn't found myself caught in Sick, Sad World
three times before I got past my teen years." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Three?" asked Jane, "I thought that School on the Firing
Range was the first time which would make this the second. Or are you counting
the one where Artie claimed we sexually molested him in our flying saucer?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"No, I'm not counting Artie," said Daria, "since we were
more like the inspiration for his fantasies. The first time was Highland, when
the BATF invaded my school. Those two boys you met were made honorary members
of the BATF or so they said, along with Sick, Sad World. An episode called "Hunting
Lesbian Seagull." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Oh, yeah." Jane shook her head remembering those two and
contemplating them as BATF. It really was a sick, sad world. "By the way,
whatever happened to them?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria shrugged. "I'm not sure. I heard they healed up.
They were hurt, but that blonde that shot those cops right in front of us had
avoided any vital hits on Beavis and Butt-head. Apparently she wanted to beat
the crap out of them without causing them any permanent injuries. No one knows
why. <span class=GramE>Least of all me.</span> Then they said something to
Andrea on their way out of the hospital and she beat them up again." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Wow, they really have bad luck with women. Maybe we
should take pity on them and double date them." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria started, and then narrowed her eyes. "Jane Lane,
some things are just not to be joked about. Besides, they've already gone back
to Highland." She shook her head. "I don't think I'd be brave enough to date them.
And I wouldn't ask you to sacrifice your dignity and your sanity by dating
either one with me anyway." Then she took a closer look at her friend when she
saw Jane lower her eyes and look haunted. "What? Don't tell me you already went
on a date with one of them." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane shook her head, ashamed. "Daria, I..." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria turned to her. "What? Kissed my boyfriend?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane snorted. Then she shook her head. "I'm sorry I didn't
stand behind you when you shot Matthew." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria blinked. "What? I thought you did?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane shook her head, her face red. "No. I ran. I got
scared and I ran. DeMartino grabbed me, but I let him drag me away." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"That you didn't join me against an armed psycho when you
were without a weapon yourself and couldn't offer anything but distraction is
something that bothers you?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane blinked. "Yeah, I guess I am being stupid about <span
class=GramE>it</span>." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I know what you mean, though," said Daria. "When
Cartwright was too much, I ran, leaving Quinn to him. There was just nothing
else I could do. Just run or go down with her." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"If you'd stayed, we wouldn't have been warned. We'd all
be dead. Maybe Cartwright and all the others wouldn't have gotten away with it,
but we'd still be dead. I'm glad you ran." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I still feel terrible about it. Quinn stood up for me and
I left her." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane shook her head. "When Quinn snubbed you, even denying
she was your sister, you helped her. When she was being shot at, you put your
own life on the line to save her. You were able to do something and you did. So
you WERE there for her. When you ran the second time, there was nothing you
could do but run. And because you ran, she's alive. So am I." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria was silent for a minute. Then, "Not to change the
subject, but I'm getting hungry." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane smiled. <span class=GramE>"Me, too."</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria shrugged. "Okay, Pizza King, here we come." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So's <span class=SpellE>youse</span> best have our pizza
ready, or I'll introduce you to a very special friend," said Jane, doing a poor
imitation of <span class=SpellE>Scarface</span>. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Fortunately for Pizza King, their staff was prompt with
the ordered pizza, so the Daria and Jane simply paid for it with cash and the
staff didn't pay with blood. The dangerous duo sat down to eat and talk about
their future. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Think any of the better colleges have martial arts or
shooting scholarships?" asked Jane. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria shrugged, smiling slightly. "Well <span
class=SpellE>Elye</span> Alexander, an <span class=SpellE>unschooler</span>,
was a state medalist in Tae Kwon Do and was accepted at Bromwell in 1990..." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Ugh," interrupted Jane, "who would want to go to
Bromwell?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria blushed slightly, and Jane barely noticed it. "I
thought about it," said Daria, "since Tom was going. But Tom and I have kind of
drifted apart, and I'm not sure I'm up to hanging with a bunch of people with
their noses stuck in the air. I've had my fill of that for a long, long time.
They're not even funny anymore, just exasperating." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane considered whether or not to say anything about Tom
but decided against it. She smiled and briefly touched Daria's wrist as she
said, "Well, Tom may be out of the picture, but we've only gotten closer." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria smiled back at her best friend, and decided to leave
out how she and Tom promised to keep in touch. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I don't know, amiga," Jane continued. "I don't care, but
a lot of people really care about that piece of paper." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yeah," said Daria, "but the more of us who refuse to play
the game, the faster those rules will change. Besides," she added, "what a lot
don't tell you <span class=GramE>is</span> that you can easily become
overqualified if you get too many degrees. Even a high school dropout can
sometimes have better job opportunities, if only because McDonald's will hire
the dropout before someone they consider overqualified." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So why go?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Why not?" asked Daria. "I sure don't plan to hang around
Lawndale." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Can't wait to get back to Highland, can you?" asked Jane.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"That's it," said Daria, "draw." While Jane blinked, she
took a sip of soda in her straw, pulled the straw out and blew it at her.
Naturally, Jane had to return the favor. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Hey!" shouted an older guy behind the counter, "Cut it
out or I send you home!" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria turned to Jane. "But they let Kevin Thompson do
things a lot worse than that." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane shrugged. <span class=GramE>"Lawndale Lions.</span>
They can do anything." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Except read," replied Daria. "Next time, we'll bring guns
and settle our disputes with a duel of honor." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Are we really mature enough for college?" asked Jane
laughing. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Is anyone?" asked Daria. "Look, it's just something we
should think about." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane <span class=SpellE>tsked</span> and shook her head. "Thinking
of the future, personal responsibility, worried about fitting in with the Man
and the same system that nearly chewed you up. What a sellout." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Hey," said Daria, "there's honor in being a mole to root
your way into power and destroy it from within." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I don't know," said Jane suspiciously. "And you just spit
soda at me instead of shooting me. You're getting soft around the edges,
Morgendorffer." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Maybe," replied Daria, "or maybe you got glaucoma." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So, <span class=SpellE><i>companera</i></span><i> </i>Morgendorffer,"
replied Jane, "how do we infiltrate the system?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"We could find an internship or apprenticeship through
INTERIM. They've had some amazing successes at connecting people like us to
mentors who can appreciate us for our talents and abilities rather than the
piece of paper in our hand. In turn, we'd gain more experience to impress
anyone looking at our transcripts or resume. They can help me with achieving
higher academics and you with the arts, while doing something with our lives at
the same time." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I never heard of that," said Jane. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"They're online," said Daria, "look them up. Anyway, there
are also correspondence courses, colleges that give credit for life
experiences, and other alternatives. Emil <span class=SpellE>Berendt</span> got
a B.S. that way by the time he was 16, and before he even graduated from high
school. All we need is a good <span class=SpellE>GED</span>, good scores on AP
and achievement tests, and maybe a good interview and application essay. Kids
who got an education without school have been getting into colleges for
decades, even Bromwell, and universities are more and more prepared today to
deal with nonstandard applications than they were before." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Maybe," said Jane, "but I don't know. I mean I like the
entire maverick routine, it's just not something I put a lot of thought into
before." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Well, the library has the latest edition of <i>Bear's
Guide to Non-Traditional College Degrees</i> in the reference section. We can
find all kinds of options there. Or we could do something unexpected but still
traditional." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Like what?" asked Jane. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Well," said Daria thinking, "you could go to the San
Francisco Art Institute and there are plenty of schools around there I could go
to. Some geared to helping writers while helping with other degrees at the same
time." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane shook her head as she replied, "Mom says that most
colleges out there are Jesuit. No way will they take in people like us." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Don't Jesuits out there let people like <span
class=SpellE>Starhawk</span> lecture at their universities, as well as invite
libertarians and other odd folks to enroll?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Oh, yeah," said Jane smiling, "I forgot, Californians are
crazy." Then she frowned. "But some Californians admit they're crazy, so in
theory they can't be." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"At least it's a change of scenery," admitted Daria,
shrugging off Jane's logic. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody>"And a long way from Lawndale, or even
Highland."</span></span><span class=postbody> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria looked at her amiga with a look that said she understood
her evil plan. Then she added, "Look, we can go to Middleton for a couple of
years and warn everyone about Quinn coming. That place is cheap enough that we
can afford that..." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Speak for <span class=GramE>yourself</span>," interrupted
Jane. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You can, too," said Daria, "Mom has already prepared the
paper work for a grant, and even if it doesn't come through, she'll cover you.
Middleton is pretty cheap compared to most places." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"You know what they say about getting what you pay for,"
replied Jane. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"In this case, it will prove that we can handle college
life," explained Daria, "while Mom gets the money from the lawsuits against the
police and several media outlets. She expects most to settle out of court by
then anyway, and it should be more than enough to send us anywhere we want to
go, even Bromwell." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Not going to Bromwell," said Jane firmly. "But I don't
mind taking a couple of years to put together a killer art portfolio and you
prove you can handle the rigors of academia with your usual stellar academic
performance. Then, if we want, we could go somewhere higher. Like, have you
thought of going to Raft while I went to BFAC? They're in the same town. We
could get together on the weekend, eat pizza, and complain." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria smiled a bit. "Maybe," she said. "There's time
enough to decide on that still. Let's think about it and see just how much
settlement money comes in by then." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane shrugged. "So how is your family doing? Better than
mine, I hope." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"There have been setbacks, but Quinn's job helped a
little. Mom and Marguerite are talking about starting their own law firm
together, too. They both know a lot of people and it looks real hopeful. Dad
just got a consulting job but even he might wind up working for Mom." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Joy," said Jane neutrally. "So Quinn still has her job?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria shook her head. "No, now that the trial is over she
pretty much quit and used some of money that she made for taking more <span
class=SpellE>krav</span> <span class=SpellE>maga</span> classes." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I'm surprised Chez Pierre hired her in the first place,"
said Jane. "You'd think they'd be scared she'd shoot the place up, given what
was said about you two." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Maybe they wanted free publicity," shrugged Daria. "It
seemed more people came, just to size up Quinn if nothing else." Daria left out
that Quinn had been making a lot of friends among local college students. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"So how she and the Fashion Drones get along?" asked Jane,
taking a sip of <span class=GramE>soda.</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria shrugged again. "They disbanded, but I hear they
still hang out. Sandi even started taking martial arts, too, though she's
taking a tae kwon do class." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane frowned. <span class=GramE>"<span class=SpellE>Hmph</span>.</span>
Maybe WE better take some martial arts classes, too." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria replied noncommittally, "Why not just get a gun?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane laughed and picked up her soda. <span class=GramE>"To
college.</span> I can't wait. What do you think we'll find when we get there?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Hmm," replied Daria, "that the students are shockingly
ignorant, the professors' self-centered and corrupt, and the entire system
geared solely to the pursuit of funding." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Jane blinked at that. It looked like this ordeal had left
its mark on her amiga. <span class=GramE>"Hmm, yes.</span> You know what I said
about you getting soft?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"Yes?" </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>"I take it back." </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>They toasted each other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>AUTHOR'S NOTES</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><br>
<span class=postbody>"Even in the best and most peacefully civilized countries
many occasions arise when a woman versed in the knowledge and use of firearms
may find that information and skill of great importance." </span><br>
--<span class=postbody>Annie Oakley, Oct. 1919</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Given the many questions and
comments I got from beta readers and others who saw an earlier version of this <span
class=SpellE>fic</span>, I thought I should share some notes regarding it. I'd
remind you that this story wasn't about convincing you, gentle reader, of
anything. It was just a story and the Great American Gun Debate was part of
what would likely happen if a story like this actually occurred. This story is
about a political and media circus that attacks everyone. Each character's own
thoughts and words are used to show character development and growth. And as
Daria realized as she spoke with Ms. <span class=SpellE>Ribner</span>, she was
herself struggling with the ambiguities of guilt, anger, and self-hatred. In
that very human, but very uncomfortable, position, it was difficult not to
alienate her would-be allies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In a way, what I have Daria <span
class=GramE>do,</span> isn't all that different from when Daria countered that
modeling agency with Brutal Mercenary magazine in an earlier episode of the
series. She had no interest in joining them--she tore up the pamphlets when she
got home. She was just countering Ms. Li's opportunism, exposing her hypocrisy,
and making a point. That's what I have Daria doing in my <span class=SpellE>fic</span>
here where she makes the points she does against <span class=SpellE>HCI</span>
and the NRA.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>I personally respect guns, the way
I respect pools, trampolines, cars, gasoline, and cleansing chemicals kept
under the kitchen sink (all of these are also dangerous, btw). I don't assume
those with guns are violent criminals anymore than I assume those with cars
take part in drive-by shootings. I also have a lot of respect and admiration
for pacifists, as long as they aren't fatalists. Such people include the Amish,
and the Christian Anarchist Leo Tolstoy (the one who inspired Mahatma Gandhi).
I like the excerpt by Robert Anton Wilson called, "A Lesson in Karma" (you can
find that on the net), too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For those who don't know, Daria is
a spin-off from Beavis and Butt-head (as incredibly unlikely as that seems).
While I don't care much for B&amp;B myself, I did like Beavis and Butt-head Do
America. Given that the ATF would get involved in Daria's case in my <span
class=SpellE>fic</span>, I thought it was worth watching again, and I was
inspired to bring some of its characters into my <span class=SpellE>fic</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mayor <span class=SpellE>Codey</span>
of Middleton (mentioned in Chapter 8 of Part III) is, unfortunately, based on a
real person: Senate President <span class=SpellE>Codey</span> of New Jersey. I
would hope even those who support his gun control policies would at least blast
him for his sexist statements, or perhaps publicly disavow him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE><span style='color:black'>The Reid
technique that Detectives Cartwright and Warner used on Daria and Jane is,
unfortunately, also real and legal.</span></span><span style='color:black'>
And, yeah, all those pro-gun groups I listed really do exist, as well as some I
didn't mention (Geeks <span class=GramE>With</span> Guns, for example). And I
did a lot of research before casting Dallas Grimes from <i>Beavis &amp;
Butt-head Do America</i> as an ex-CIA agent. While I did use some artistic
license, I think the CIA is actually worse in both efficiency and amorality
than I portrayed it. However, Operation Hobgoblin is pure speculation and
simply intended as a plot device.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>One asked me why I had people call
Daria a vigilante. I will give a much shorter version of what I told him, in
case anyone else is wondering. Essentially, the media loves to trash people,
scare them (yes, I know Moore visits this theme, too), and politicians and
prosecutors trying to further their own careers and agendas will do better if
they paint their chosen sacrificial goat as something scary (and a vigilante is
scarier than a woman who saved her younger sister from a stalker). There is
also the sad case of Linda Hamilton, who didn't even use a gun (see http://<span
class=SpellE>billstclair.com/LindaHamilton</span>/), who was painted pretty
much that way by a judge, and she didn't even fire it. As already mentioned,
Sen. <span class=SpellE>Codey</span> refers to the attempt to rape, sodomize,
and kill women as a "dispute" in which "guns do not belong." It seems obvious
that they'd paint Daria as a vigilante.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Someone I once talked with said
that she was against guns was because "the only purpose of a gun is to kill."
So I shared about a guy I knew who was carrying meds to his Aunt just out of
the hospital after some surgery. He did not have a car, but he had a gun. While
walking home, several "young men" (he's in his 30s, so who knows what counts as
young to him) charged him. He pulled his gun and the men fled. He was not
injured or robbed (that is, violence was averted), and his Aunt got her meds. <span
class=GramE>Which is to say, the purpose of a gun can also be to protect and
save.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>She told me it was "sad" that he
would "solve his problems with a gun." <span class=SpellE>Gobsmacked</span> by
that response, I asked her what she would've done in his place. She said, "I'd
have called the cops. I carry a cell phone." (She said that with such a smug
sense of righteousness, too.) When I asked her how likely it was the attackers
would let her use it, what if she was in a dead zone so that her phone didn't
work, or if the cops could get there in time before they dragged her off or
whatever, she refused to answer "trick questions." (Of course this meant I
couldn't share about other experiences I knew about, or about the police using
guns.) All in all, I'd say she'd describe Daria in this <span class=SpellE>fic</span>
as a vigilante. That's how she saw that guy who used a gun to stop violence
without even shooting anyone, so what else could Daria be but a murderous
vigilante?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As for the chapter on Michael
Moore, it is my view that I exaggerated his bad points for the sake of parody
(similar to the style of MAD magazine)<span class=GramE>,</span> though I do
think he's dishonest. (But <i>Bowling for Columbine</i> is well-done, IMO, and
I LOVED what Marilyn Manson had to say on it.) The way I envisioned this <span
class=SpellE>fic</span>, Moore was getting started on what would become <span
class=SpellE>BFC</span>. But after the Lawndale disaster, he took a slightly
different and toned-down approach. While many beta readers enjoyed this
chapter, a few have said I got him exactly right while others said I'm too
harsh on him. If you're wondering yourself why anyone would like or dislike
him, I'd suggest looking him and his works (especially <i>Bowling for Columbine</i>)
up on Wikipedia, perhaps one of the only neutral sources about him out there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He was not the only media source
or figure I parodied or portrayed in a negative light. As I said at the very
beginning, this is a story in the Daria-verse in which Daria runs into the
idiots and jerks more than anyone else, and I intended to show that aspect. But
many of the barely coherent statements made by President Bush are based on
statements attributed to him in real life. Some are verified, direct quotes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>I admit that I hold a fairly
negative view of both supposed liberal and conservative media sources, though
there are redeeming aspects to each. And although I genuinely hold the <span
class=SpellE>SPLC</span> in low regard, I do like their Teaching Tolerance
periodical. While haunting the radio for liberal and conservative <span
class=SpellE>spokesentities</span> to mock, I came across a pleasant hour of
Thom Hartmann. (I still hope for liberals to return to the true type, as
explained in <i>The Case for Modern Man</i> by Charles Frankel.) Having only
heard him once, I can't really endorse him (I'd have to tune in several more
times first, which I haven't done), but the one show I did listen to gave me
hope for the future of political discourse. I also found the <span
class=SpellE>Grand'pa</span> Jack booklets well-done and helpful to my <span
class=SpellE>fic</span>, and I got permission from Michael Z. Williamson to use
some of his parodying of gun control groups in my <span class=SpellE>fic</span>,
too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Unfortunately, too many liberals
and conservatives like to talk about liberty and justice but practice (or at
least advocate others practice) the opposite. Perhaps the most lucid
explanation of that (and one that destroys the lies of both sides) is found in <i>The
Policeman Is Your Friend and Other Lies,</i> by Ned Beaumont. Another book
would be <i>The New Doublespeak</i>, by William Lutz. <i>Attention Deficit
Democracy</i>, by James <span class=SpellE>Bovard</span>, is yet another that
trashes the hypocrisy of both sides that is rubbed in our faces more than most
of us care for (and encourages otherwise good people to partake of their bad
example).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>And if you found the idea I
promote of the NRA and gun control groups working together odd, then Google "Another
NRA Betrayal" by Nick <span class=SpellE>Fellenzer</span> on the net. That's
just one example, and one I would think would concern "both" sides of the
issue, even if NF is passionately pro-gun ownership. There's a much more
detailed explanation on the <span class=SpellE>NRAWOL</span> site (http://<span
class=SpellE>www.nrawol.com</span>/).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The bad examples from both sides
of the debate in my <span class=SpellE>fic</span> exist. I got a lot of it from
real life experience. I took some things from a public radio show trying to ban
guns. It was worse than the antigun folks in my <span class=SpellE>fic</span>
because the group on the show included an old woman. Every time a caller
pointed out the holes in the antigun logic (and some of these were big enough
to fly a jet through), the old woman would pretend to break down in tears. Then
the others there would berate the caller as cruel. As for the "other side,"
some of the wild tangents I had the irritating NRA folk express were taken, in
some cases, almost verbatim from pro-gun boards.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>I've met a few gun owners who were
jerks and bullies. And I just don't get the idea that teaching gun safety in
school is a Good Thing but that teaching safe sex (anything other than
abstinence-only) is going to turn those same kids into rapists and perverts. Or
the even more common one of warning us not to get hysterical over the danger of
guns to children while then turning around and advising hysteria over gays
getting married and being around children. And perhaps I should give thanks to the
NRA jerk that gave me a hard time over doing this <span class=SpellE>fic</span>,
and for stealing many of my gun magazines after he pressured me into making him
lunch. Because of him, I was able to really paint the NRA jerks in a bad light,
which I had a hard time doing because I know plenty who aren't jerks (and they
get <span class=SpellE>scapegoated</span> enough as it is).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>I've also met jerks and bullies
who opposed guns--not because guns are bad, but because they are bad people and
they didn't want to be afraid as they yelled at old women and pushed little
people around (or worse). I know the rude businessman in San Francisco that
slammed his fist down on the hood of my car likely would've soiled himself if
he knew I had a gun when he did it. (Though the temptation I had was to run him
over, not shoot him. Although he was the only one to actually hit my car - no,
I don't know why, I hadn't hit him or even honked at him, and I was correctly
stopped - rude seemed to be the standard style of that city.) Another guy
pretended to have hippie values but was a total bully to me and other people. I
thought he was going to attack me once, when he was blatantly intimidating me.
Being at least a foot taller than me and probably twice my weight, he did not
fear me (I'll add that I never saw him do this to guys his own size). But he
did fear someone like me with a gun.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>So these bad examples do exist,
though I like to think they're the minority. But these bad examples tend to
stick in our memory and awareness, especially if we don't normally see the
better behaved examples. (Many people are often surprised by who owns--or
carries--a gun). Calling each other evil and stupid and ranting up a storm doesn't
work for anyone, at least not anyone decent who is hoping for a better world.
It works great to create a polarized community, open to financial and political
exploitation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Anyway, for a summary of the
arguments for and against gun control (or, if you prefer, victim disarmament)
and the 2nd Amendment, check Wikipedia:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>http://<span class=SpellE>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Another thing I was hoping to
share is that there is also more than one side. Some promote--or oppose--guns as
a feminist or gay issue. Others are big believers in registries and laws while
supporting Carry Conceal Weapon permits. Still others think it's imperative
that guns are an issue of liberty rather than law and it's morally wrong for
the government to require permits for the same reason it's morally wrong to
require permits to speak your mind or express your opinion on the internet.
Some support their right to hunting rifles and sneer at handgun owners, while
others are against hunting and long guns, but believe it's important for more
to carry handguns in order to cow the criminals that prey on ordinary folk.
Some gun owners hate the NRA. Cindy Hill is a vegetarian liberal that considers
the right to bear arms to be as important as protecting the environment and
protecting the civil rights of anyone and everyone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>One thing I think many people on
the pro-gun and anti-gun sides have in common is a desire for less violence. I
would like to see such people reach out and find ways to work together on this
problem in ways they CAN agree on. Fighting violence rather than fighting guns
seems more practical anyway, because if you can't trust a person with a gun,
how can you trust them with a car, cleansers, a knife, hot grease, or the
preparation of your food? (Btw, cleansers, trampolines, pools, and such cause a
lot more injuries and deaths, including among children.) And if violence went
down, fewer people would care about getting a gun anyway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Instead on endlessly arguing
(often more like 10-year-olds than as rational adults), they could work
together to form crime watch groups in bad areas, fighting the racism and
sexism often inherent in the application of gun control (and other) laws,
helping those with restraining orders when a harassing or threatening ex shows
up (since so many cops don't give a damn about enforcing these), making sure those
rape kits that so many cops and prosecutors let collect dust unused actually
get used, building teen centers that can help young people bond with other
people, rather than with TV and video games, working to eradicate bullying in
schools (and other places), and guarding against abuse or misuse of psychiatric
meds (including in watching for side effects). Any or all of the above would
probably do a lot to solve violence in schools and workplaces.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Though I will add DARE is, at
best, a joke. So is Partnership for a Drug Free America. Among many other
things I could say about them (a few I have Daria say in the <span
class=SpellE>fic</span>), many kids (and I was one of them) were able to
discover much of what they say is false and so discounted the true dangers of
drugs along with the false dangers. If you want to discourage experimentation,
then at least go with a REPUTABLE group like <span class=SpellE>CSDP</span>
(http://<span class=SpellE>www.csdp.org</span>/). While you're at it, take some
time to listen to the Students for a Sensible Drug Policy and Educators for
Sensible Drug Policy, too. Likewise, fighting against forfeiture (see FEAR at
http://<span class=SpellE>www.fear.org</span>/) is also important. Those cases
of cops I mentioned in Part <span class=GramE>I</span> of my <span
class=SpellE>fic</span>, who kill so they can confiscate the victim's property,
are real, as are many other evils that I have not listed. Our Constitution
forbids this because of what was going on in Europe at the time it was written,
which is now going on again in America now that the practice has been revived
and legitimized.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>And PLEASE don't target scapegoats
(like <span class=SpellE>goths</span>) for persecution. Should you insist on <span
class=SpellE>scapegoating</span> some group, then target jocks and <span
class=GramE>cheerleaders.</span> My experience says these folk are more violent
and often are given a free pass to bully. (NO, I'm NOT saying to scapegoat
jocks. But if you absolutely cannot survive without a scapegoat, then jocks are
more appropriate than <span class=SpellE>goths</span> or whatever group you
care to think of. But remember that even though they're seen as successes and
full of self esteem, they're under major pressure to stay on their pedestal and
are at least as prone to suicide as lonely <span class=SpellE>goths</span>.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Doing so, I hope, would not only
combat violence more effectively than trying to ban guns or spread them
everywhere, but would get people to connect to one another. I'd love it if the
partisan Jerry Springer crap and bumper sticker sloganeering became shameful to
most people rather than the way we "debate" politics with each other.
Furthermore, it could lead to a greater solidarity when fighting abuses of
power. Aaron Zelman is a conservative who has promoted such "reaching out" and
helping others in exchange for support. So has liberal Cindy Hill. So have
others not so easily defined by the partisan divide. I wish these people would
become the norm instead of the exception.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Personally, I think the right of jury
nullification is perhaps one of the most important aspects our country needs to
keep. This, more than guns or free press or voting, is essential to our
liberty. However, it is coming under increasing attack as America continues to
plunge into a nightmare for those who care about individual liberty and civil
rights. In talking with an active participant of <span class=SpellE>FIJA</span>
(http://<span class=SpellE>www.fija.org</span>/) about this <span class=SpellE>fic</span>,
I was told the method used to help Daria in the federal trial likely would not
have been allowed. Oh, what the defense says is true enough, but many of those
in power fear jury nullification far more than they fear an armed citizenry
willing to vote and write angry letters to the editor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Finally, I do have an idea for a
sequel that I may do one day. It takes place a couple of years later with
Daria, Jane, and Quinn as Middleton students. Quinn has just been cast in the
part of Kim Possible in a movie (yes, I have an explanation for how she got the
part over some of the bigger names and better connected out there). <span
class=SpellE>Dara</span>, a.k.a. Dallas Grimes, is also on scene, and she has
plans for OH. If I do it, I plan to make Mr. DeMartino a main character,
exploring his personal past and what makes him tick. But I don't know if or
when I'll do such a <span class=SpellE>fic</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, THANK YOU to all my beta readers, and those who saw
an earlier version of this and/or got a sneak preview that also sent in your
comments and encouragement. You've all helped this story become better than
what it would've been without your input. And a special Thank You to The Angst
Guy, as without his help and encouragement, you would not have even been able
to read this on this site at all.</p>
