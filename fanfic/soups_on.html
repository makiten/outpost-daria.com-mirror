SOUP'S ON!
<P>
A <I>Daria </I>ficlet by wyvern337
<P>
&quot;Well, it can't be any worse than the Thai peanut sauce,&quot;
said Helen. &quot;Even though you've said this <I>is</I> another
foreign language cookbook.&quot;
<P>
&quot;It's okay,&quot; Jake assured her. &quot;<I>This</I> time
I've got a phrasebook!&quot;
<P>
Helen didn't hear him, she was already out the door. On her way
to the office, called in to work overtime on another important
case. They always were important, Jake thought sourly as he cut
up an onion into the stewpot.
<P>
&quot;I'll save you some!&quot; he called after her, preferring
to at least feign optimism. &quot;You girls are really gonna like
this! I had to go to another town to get some of the spices...to
an <I>apothecary!</I> would you have believed there were even
such things anymore?&quot; Jake continued, trying to stir up some
enthusiasm among the Morgendorffer offspring.
<P>
&quot;Maybe you could, like, save me some too, Daddy?&quot; said
Quinn, also headed for the door. &quot;Emergency meeting of the
Fashion Club.&quot;
<P>
And then she was gone, too.
<P>
&quot;Guess it's just you and me, kiddo,&quot; said Jake.
<P>
&quot;Mmm,&quot; replied Daria without lowering the newspaper
she was reading at the kitchen table.
<P>
It just wasn't <I>fair</I>, thought Jake as he sifted the next-to-last
of the exotic herbs he'd purchased into the stew. He <I>liked
</I>to cook, it was something he wanted to do for -- and share
with -- his family. Something he'd never gotten from <I>his </I>dad.
Oh, his <I>mom,</I> sure, but never old Mad Dog! Nooo, cooking
was for <I>girls</I> -- and <I>sissies!</I> Well maybe Jake Morgendorffer
<I>wants</I> to cook for his family, dammit! If only <I>they </I>appreciated
it!
<P>
Somewhat unusually, instead of launching into a loud ranting tirade,
Jake muttered darkly into the stew as he stirred it. Darkly but
softly..some of the language wouldn't be appropriate for sensitive
young ears, he thought. It was a surprisingly-thorough venting
for all that -- the bubbling pot of meat, vegetables and broth
was told not only all of Jake Morgendorffer's frustrations and
disappointments, but a surprising amount of his hopes and dreams,
as well.
<P>
After a little while, he got himself under control and resumed
following the recipe, going back and forth between the old leather-bound
cookbook -- at least that's what he'd <I>figured </I>it was --
that he'd run across at the used bookstore while he was looking
for a birthday present for Daria, and the phrasebook he'd bought
a few days later. Well, if this turned out as well as he was hoping
it would, maybe this first dish from the cookbook could be part
of that present.
<P>
&quot;You know, Dad,&quot; said Daria from behind the paper, &quot;I
have to admit this does at least <I>smell</I> better than your
usual efforts.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Hey, thanks, Kiddo!&quot; said Jake. And he noticed it was
true...this stuff <I>did</I> smell pretty good. An exotic, well,
<I>spicy</I> scent.
<P>
&quot;Just one more ingredient to add,&quot; he said. &quot;It
says here it's supposed to..it says here....he looked back and
forth between the cookbook an the phrasebook. &quot;Affect the
final...<I>transmogrification?</I> That doesn't make any sense,
does it? Hey, Kiddo, what's 'transmogrify' mean, anyway?&quot;
<P>
&quot;To affect a transformation, usually somehow grotesque or
fanciful in nature,&quot; answered Daria. &quot;Dad, are you <I>sure</I>
adding that last ingredient's a good idea? Maybe you should quit
while you're ahead?&quot;
<P>
Daria was right, as usual, thought Jake. This seemed so much better
than his usual tries at cooking that it really <I>would</I> be
a shame to ruin it now.
<P>
&quot;Y'know, Kiddo, I think that'd be a good idea, he said, turning
towards his daughter as he said it. What say I just let this simmer
a little while and then you and me--&quot;
<P>
Jake gesticulated as he said the last few words, and in doing
so accidentally flipped the last ingredient into the stewpot.
The reaction began immediately. First the smell changed -- for
the worse. Both he and Daria, finally lowering he newspaper to
see what was going on, wrinkled their noses in response to the
change.
<P>
&quot;Oh, <I>great,</I>&quot; said Jake. &quot;I finally <I>start</I>
to get a dish right and then I screw things up AGAIN!&quot;
<P>
&quot;It's okay, Dad,&quot; Daria reassured him. &quot;It seemed
to be going well up 'til that last part, so maybe if you rounded
up the ingredients again and--&quot;
<P>
Just then, the stew came to a full boil, with a vengeance: a single,
unnaturally large bubble formed, rose, and burst, splattering
all over the kitchen.
<P>
&quot;GAAAAH! DAMMIT!&quot; exclaimed Jake. &quot;Kiddo, I'm <I>really
</I>sorry about this. D'you think you could help me clean...uh,
<I>Daria?</I>&quot;
<P>
Jake suddenly noticed his daughter had gone pale as a ghost, and
was staring fixedly at the stove as the newspaper slipped unnoticed
from her fingers. A tiny &quot;eep!&quot; was the only reply she
could manage.
<P>
Jake turned back towards the range-top to survey the damage. It
must've been pretty severe for Daria to've...Jake's mouth fell
open in shock and amazement.
<P>
The Soup Elemental reared up out of the stockpot, spread it's
leathery wings, and shook itself, scattering stray droplets of
broth. It fixed its gaze on Jake.
<P>
&quot;What is thy bidding, my master?&quot; it asked.
<P>
