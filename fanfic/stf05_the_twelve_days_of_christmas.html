<P>&#9;<I>I've had enough chicken, thank you.</P>
</I>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On the third day of Christmas, Scarlett the Fairy gave to me:</P>

<P>3 Orders of Pommes Frites</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Ahh, these taste good.</P>
</I>
<P>2 Cynical Best Friends</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Heh, yeah, I guess that was funny.</P>
</I>
<P>And...a Bucket of Fairy Fried Chicken...ew.</P>

<P>&#9;<I>No more.  I can only eat so much chicken.</P>
</I>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On the fourth day of Christmas, Scarlett the Fairy gave to me:</P>

<P>4 Singing Fashion Birds</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Hey, they're kinda cute, too.  Wow, pretty girls all around</P>
</I>
<P>3 Orders of Pommes Frites</P>

<P>&#9;<I>O.K., I've had enough fries.</P>
</I>
<P>2 Cynical Best Friends</P>

<P>&#9;<I>O.K., that was a mean thing to say.  Yeah, it was.</P>
</I>
<P>And...a Bucket of Fairy Fried Chicken...ew.</P>

<P>&#9;<I>No more chicken.  I'm serious.</P>
</I>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On the fifth day of Christmas, Scarlett the Fairy gave to me:</P>

<P>5 Solid Gold Dimes</P>

</I>
<P>4 Singing Fashion Birds</P>

<P>&#9;<I>No, I don't have individual copies of </I>Waif<I> for you.</P>
</I>
<P>3 Orders of Pommes Frites</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Whoo.  I think I'm burned out on French Fries now.</P>
</I>
<P>2 Cynical Best Friends</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Do something new.  Pretend to be mimes.  Then I won't have to hear your smart &#9;alec comments, O.K.?</P>
</I>
<P>And...a Bucket of Fairy Fried Chicken...ew.</P>

<P>&#9;<I>What part of 'no more chicken' DON'T you understand?</P>
</I>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On the sixth day of Christmas, Scarlett the Fairy gave to me:</P>

<P>6 DVDs of Kevin Thompson being Tasered</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Now, this is funny.  I like watching that doofus do the electric boogie.</P>
</I>
<P>5 Solid Gold Dimes</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Ah, the money is raking in now.</P>
</I>
<P>4 Singing Fashion Birds</P>

<P>&#9;<I>No, I don't fruit flavored water.  I have diet Ultra Cola, though.  No, I don't have &#9;champagne.  You're too young for that, anyway.</P>
</I>
<P>3 Orders of Pommes Frites</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Does anyone want these?  I seriously cannot eat them.</P>
</I>
<P>2 Cynical Best Friends</P>

<P>&#9;<I>You care to repeat that little snide comment, girlie?</P>
</I>
<P>And...a Bucket of Fairy Fried Chicken...ew.</P>

<P>&#9;<I>I wonder how well this stuff will keep in the freezer?</P>
</I>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On the seventh day of Christmas, Scarlett the Fairy gave to me:</P>

<P>7 Bacon Explosions</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Oh, man, these things are delicious.</P>
</I>
<P>6 DVDs of Kevin Thompson being Tasered</P>

<P>&#9;<I>O.K., I've seen enough of this.</P>
</I>
<P>5 Solid Gold Dimes</P>

<P>&#9;<I>I still like this one - a lot!</P>
</I>
<P>4 Singing Fashion Birds</P>

<P>&#9;<I>O.K., which one of you threw out my flannel shirts?  Speak up!</P>
</I>
<P>3 Orders of Pommes Frites</P>

<P>&#9;<I>I freaking hate potatoes now.</P>
</I>
<P>2 Cynical Best Friends</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Don't you call me that, girls.  I'm serious.</P>
</I>
<P>And...a Bucket of Fairy Fried Chicken...ew.</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Now, I want to go back in time and make chickens extinct.</P>
</I>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On the eighth day of Christmas, Scarlett the Fairy gave to me:</P>

<P>8 Double-Thick Chocolate Mint Milkshakes</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Yummy!  And it hides the aftertaste of chicken and fries.</P>
</I>
<P>7 Bacon Explosions</P>

<P>&#9;<I>I've had enough.  My arteries can't take much more of this.</P>
</I>
<P>6 DVDs of Kevin Thompson being Tasered</P>

<P>&#9;<I>O.K., this is getting as bad as </I>America's (Not-So) Funniest Home Videos.</P>

<P>5 Solid Gold Dimes</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Still no problem with this.</P>
</I>
<P>4 Singing Fashion Birds</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Hey!  That was a gift.  I don't care if it wasn't fashionable!</P>
</I>
<P>3 Orders of Pommes Frites</P>

<P>&#9;<I>I know.  I'm being tortured, right?</P>
</I>
<P>2 Cynical Best Friends</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Oh, yeah?  At least I've got a good job!  See how far you go with that attitude!</P>
</I>
<P>And...a Bucket of Fairy Fried Chicken...ew.</P>

<P>&#9;<I>I'm seeing flying whole fried chickens when I close my eyes now.</P>
</I>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On the ninth day of Christmas, Scarlett the Fairy gave to me:</P>

<P>9 Geese-a-Layin'</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Don't ask.  She wouldn't tell me why when I asked her.</P>
</I>
<P>8 Double-Thick Chocolate Mint Milkshakes</P>

<P>&#9;<I>I've got an ice cream headache now.</P>
</I>
<P>7 Bacon Explosions</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Well, it looks like my work lunch is settled for the next several months.</P>
</I>
<P>6 DVDs of Kevin Thompson being Tasered</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Why couldn't it be a video of Brittany Taylor instead?  At least I </I>could <I>sell</I> &#9;<I>those.</P>
</I>
<P>5 Solid Gold Dimes</P>

<P>&#9;<I>O.K., my pocket is now weighed down.</P>
</I>
<P>4 Singing Fashion Birds</P>

<P>&#9;<I>No, I will not get waxed.  That's painful!</P>
</I>
<P>3 Orders of Pommes Frites</P>

<P>&#9;<I>If I never see another French Fry as long as I live, it'll be too soon.</P>
</I>
<P>2 Cynical Best Friends</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Bite me, girls!  You heard me, dammit!</P>
</I>
<P>And...a Bucket of Fairy Fried Chicken...ew.</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Oh, man, now I'm gonna have nightmares about that </I>Ghost Chickens in the Sky&#9;<I>song</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On the tenth day of Christmas, Scarlett the Fairy gave to me:</P>

<P>10 Pepperoni Pizzas</P>
<P>&#9;</P>
<P>&#9;<I>Good, a change of taste.</P>
</I>
<P>9 Geese-a-Layin'</P>

<P>&#9;<I>I wonder how geese eggs taste when boiled or scrambled?</P>
</I>
<P>8 Double-Thick Chocolate Mint Milkshakes</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Now, I'm foundered on chocolate...and mint...and milk.</P>
</I>
<P>7 Bacon Explosions</P>

<P>&#9;<I>I never thought that I'd say I never want another piece of bacon again.</P>
</I>
<P>6 DVDs of Kevin Thompson being Tasered</P>

<P>&#9;<I>AHHH!  NO MORE!  IT'S STUPID!</P>
</I>
<P>5 Solid Gold Dimes</P>

<P>&#9;<I>What do you mean I'm in a different tax bracket now?</P>
</I>
<P>4 Singing Fashion Birds</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Wow, and I thought that I was shallow.</P>
</I>
<P>3 Orders of Pommes Frites</P>

<P>&#9;<I>When I close my eyes, I see crawling French Fries.</P>
</I>
<P>2 Cynical Best Friends</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Keep it up.  I'm about at my limit with you two.</P>
</I>
<P>And...a Bucket of Fairy Fried Chicken...ew.</P>

<P>&#9;<I>I now understand the meaning of cruel and unusual punishment.</P>
</I>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On the eleventh day of Christmas, Scarlett the Fairy gave to me:</P>

<P>11 Glitterberries</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Hey, these taste really good!</P>
</I>
<P>10 Pepperoni Pizzas</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Why are the pepperoni marching on the pizzas?</P>
</I>
<P>9 Geese-a-Layin'</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Wow, now the geese are talking to me, too.</P>
</I>
<P>8 Double-Thick Chocolate Mint Milkshakes</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Hey, the milkshakes are now chocolate volcanoes.  Cool!</P>
</I>
<P>7 Bacon Explosions</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Oh, no!  The bacon's exploding!  Call 911!  But what's the number for 911?</P>
</I>
<P>6 DVDs of Kevin Thompson being Tasered</P>

<P>&#9;<I>I can dance like that, too!</P>
</I>
<P>5 Solid Gold Dimes</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Wow, now FDR is singing about being a little teapot, short and stout.</P>
</I>
<P>4 Singing Fashion Birds</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Ha!  Even their wings coordinate with their clothes.</P>
</I>
<P>3 Orders of Pommes Frites</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Let's build a French Fry house.  I've got enough here.</P>
</I>
<P>2 Cynical Best Friends</P>

<P>&#9;<I>What do you mean, I'm swacked!  No, I'm not!  I'm a Protestant!</P>
</I>
<P>And...a Bucket of Fairy Fried Chicken...ew.</P>

<P>&#9;<I>All the chickens are talking to me now.  But why are they speaking in Pig Latin?</P>
</I>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On the twelfth day of Christmas, Scarlett the Fairy gave to me:</P>

<P>12 Strawberry Cheesecake Muffins</P>

<P>&#9;<I>I think I'll have a bake sale</P>
</I>
<P>11 Glitterberries</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Relax.  My spirit creature says everything will be back to norbal soon.</P>
</I>
<P>10 Pepperoni Pizzas</P>

<P>&#9;<I>My arteries are screaming by now.  Even the neighbors can hear them.</P>
</I>
<P>9 Geese-a-Layin'</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Do you realize how much geese crap there is in my place now?</P>
</I>
<P>8 Double-Thick Chocolate Mint Milkshakes</P>

<P>&#9;<I>You know, after about ten of these things, they start tasting like mint antacid.</P>
</I>
<P>7 Bacon Explosions</P>

<P>&#9;<I>My freezer is full now.  Seriously.  So's my fridge.</P>
</I>
<P>6 DVDs of Kevin Thompson being Tasered</P>
<P>&#9;</P>
<P>&#9;<I>Come to my next rummage sale, and I'll sell these at five for a dollar.</P>
</I>
<P>5 Solid Gold Dimes</P>

<P>&#9;<I>The Treasury Department wants to know where I got these, by the way.</P>
</I>
<P>4 Singing Fashion Birds</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Where the heck are those four?  And where are my credit cards?</P>
</I>
<P>3 Orders of Pommes Frites</P>

<P>&#9;<I>The only difference between Pommes Frites and French Fries is about five bucks &#9;an order.</P>
</I>
<P>2 Cynical Best Friends</P>

<P>&#9;<I>They say one more thing, I'm gonna punch them out.  I mean it!</P>
</I>
<P>And...a Bucket of Fairy Fried Chicken...ew.</P>

<P>&#9;<I>I've just been told that Chickenvania has declared war on me.</P>
