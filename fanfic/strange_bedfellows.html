<div>Rated: TV-14 (PG13) for language and suggestive behavior<p><b>Short
summary:</b><p>Sandi tries to put her life back together after the dissolution of the Fashion Club. Daria and Upchuck set up the schools new computer lab. Tom joins Daria and Jane on a school trip. A romance is kindled, but can it survive? Should it? A sequel to &quot;Breaking Strain&quot;.<p><b>Note:</b> the story
takes place immediately after my story "Breaking Strain", in the fall of Daria's
senior year.  This story continues from events that occurred in that one, so I'd
recommend reading it first. However, there's a brief recap of critical events at
the start of this script, as a refresher, or in case you haven't read
it.<p><i>Daria</i> (and associated characters and locations) is copyright

			<p><b>Intro, with title 'Daria, in "Strange
Bedfellows"':</b><p><b>ACT I</b><p><b>Flashback sequence:</b><p><b>Interior. 
Lawndale High School Hallway.</b><p><i>Quinn and Stacy are walking down the
hallway, alone.</i><p><b>Superimposed title: "Two Weeks
Ago"</b><p><b>STACY:</b>  (sighs) Another "D".  Mom's going to kill me.  Mr.
O'Neill said the other day that if I fail English they'll keep me back a year. 
(beat)  I'm beginning to wish I hadn't given up on that tutor this
summer.<p><b>QUINN:</b>  Yeah, it was a pain, but he really taught me how to
work on problems.  (beat)  You know, I'm sure you could hire someone to tutor
you evenings.  The seniors are all looking for things to pad out their college
applications, and tutoring probably counts as an extra-curricular
activity.<p><b>STACY:</b> Wow Quinn, you think of everything!  Your cousin is a
senior, could you ask her to tutor me?<p><b>Interior. Ms. Li's
Office.</b><p><i>Daria and Jodie are seated in front of Ms. Li.</i><p><b>MS
LI:</b> (businesslike) Congratulations.  The two of you have the highest overall
grade averages in the senior class.  Because of this, you have been selected to
represent Lawndale High in an experimental internship program the county schools
are conducting with Middleton College.<p><b>DARIA:</b> (annoyed) I don't recall
volunteering for an internship.<p><b>Interior. School Cafeteria.</b><p><i>The
Fashion Club is in line, selecting food to put on their
trays.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> (looking at sandwich plates) Are they trying to
poison us?  Look at all the processed meats!  Those can't be good for our
skin!<p><i>Sandi picks up a plate, and puts it on her tray.  Stacy chooses the
same kind of plate, and lifts it.  Quinn is still looking over the
selection.</i><p><i>Sandi changes her mind, and quickly puts her plate back,
choosing another one.  Stacy is caught with the old plate just above her tray. 
She looks at Sandi, then at the plate, and begins to look panicked.  Sandi looks
pleased.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> (starting to move her tray down the line) Are you
coming Stacy, or are you just going to stand there?<p><i>Anger replaces Stacy's
panicked look briefly.  She looks over at Sandi, and then puts the plate (the
original one) down on her tray and moves along.  A flash of irritation crosses
Sandi's face, although Stacy is not looking at her and doesn't see
it.</i><p><b> Interior. Jane's Room.</b><p><i>Jane is on the floor, sculpting
clay, while Daria lies on the bed, reading.</i><p><b>JANE:</b> You've been
buried in that book for an hour, what's so interesting?<p><b>DARIA:</b>  It's
an overview of how computer networks work.  They're more complicated than I
thought.<p><b>JANE:</b>  So, nerd-in-training, are my ears deceiving me, or are
you actually enjoying the job you were forced into by Ms. Li?<p><b>DARIA:</b> 
(deliberately flat voice) I never enjoy anything.  You must be
mistaken.<p><b>Interior. Morgendorffer Living Room.</b><p><i>Stacy and Sandi
face each other, while Daria, Quinn, and Tiffany look on.</i><p><b>Superimposed
title: "Last Thursday".</b><p><b>STACY:</b>  (yelling) If you care, then why
doesn't my failing English matter?  What you care about is that you're number
one!  No matter what it does to the rest of us!<p><b>SANDI:</b> (choked voice)
No!  I... No!<p><b>STACY:</b> (no longer yelling, but still angry and speaking
sharply) Well, I've had enough!  I only stayed this long because of Quinn and
Tiffany!  You and I used to be friends, but I don't know you anymore!  I don't
like who you've turned into!  It's over!  I'm quitting the fashion club, and you
can just go to hell!  I never want to see you again, now get out of here and let
me finish my English paper!<p><i>Sandi crumbles.  She doesn't speak, but turns
and bolts out the door past Tiffany.  As she passes the camera, tears can be
seen in her eyes.  A door slams outside, and her car is heard speeding
off.</i><p><b>End flashback sequence.</b><p><b>Interior. Bedroom - Monday
Morning.</b><p><b>Open on a close-up of the back of a head, resting on a
pillow.  The room is dimly lit (as if by sunlight behind thick curtains).  Long,
dark brown hair spills across the bed.  </b><p><b>Superimposed title: "Monday
6:30 AM, The Present".</b><p><i>An alarm clock rings, and an arm extends out
from beneath the sheet and reaches off-screen.  It moves violently, and the
alarm cuts off.  </i><p><b>Fade out and back in on the same view of a head on a
pillow.</b><p><b>WOMANS VOICE:</b> (off-screen, distorted through a door) You'd
better be out of bed young lady.  Your alarm went off thirty minutes
ago.<p><i>A voice speaks from the bed; it's muffled by the
pillow.</i><p><b>VOICE:</b> M'up.<p><b>WOMANS VOICE:</b> (off-screen) What? 
I'm coming in there.<p><i>A door opens off-screen, and footsteps approach the
bed.  Curtains are pulled aside, and light spills into the room.  The camera
pulls back to show Linda Griffin standing in her daughter Sandi's bedroom, next
to a window.  Linda moves to the bed, and pulls the sheet back, revealing Sandi
dressed in an oversized t-shirt, facedown and clutching her pillow as a
shipwreck victim clutches a life preserver.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> (muffled by
pillow) Go 'way.  'm sick.<p><b>LINDA:</b> (coldly) Yeah, right.  Just like
you've been "sick" all weekend.  That excuse worked Friday, but not any more. 
I'll be back in five minutes, and you'd better be up and dressed or you'll
regret it.  You're already late enough that I'm going to have to drive you to
school and be late for work.  Don't make things any worse than they already
are.<p><i>Linda turns and walks out.  After she's gone, Sandi sits up.  Her
eyes are bloodshot, and dark lines underscore her eyes.  She looks like she
hasn't slept well in days.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> (with anger) That's right, you
bitch, show a little sympathy why don't you.  My whole damn world is ruined, and
you're worried about being late for work.  (calmer) Well, if I don't get
dressed, she'll probably stuff me into whatever's handy and dump me on the curb
in front of the school anyway.  If I'm going to be humiliated, at least I'll do
it on my own two feet.<p><i>Sandi rises and walks out of the
room.</i><p><b>Fade out and back in.</b><p><i>Sandi is sitting at her make-up
table, dressed in her usual blue top and maroon slacks.  She's trying to brush
her hair into order, but it doesn't seem to be going well.  Linda walks in and
stands behind her.</i><p><b>LINDA:</b> (unsympathetically) You look like death
warmed over.  Finish the hair and I'll put in some eye drops for the redness. 
You'll need to look your best if you're going to take back the Fashion Club from
Quinn.<p><i>Sandi turns around and glares at her mother.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b>
I've told you a dozen times; Quinn had nothing to do with this.  Stacy quit the
club, and the others followed her.  As far as I know I'm still president, of a
club with no members.<p><b>LINDA:</b> (scornful) That jellyfish couldn't decide
to paint her nails without someone telling her what to do.  Take it from me,
Quinn's behind this.  She's just like her mother, that
manipulative...<p><b>SANDI:</b> (cutting off Linda) Yeah, yeah, you said that
already. Give it a rest.  You don't know Quinn.  If she were going to stab me in
the back, she'd let me know she did it afterwards.  She likes to gloat.  You
just can't accept that I brought this on myself by taking Stacy for granted all
these years.<p><b>LINDA:</b> (sharply) Don't talk to me like that, young lady! 
What I can't accept is that any daughter of mine could be such a loser.  You let
Stacy tear down the club you spent the last three years building.  Stacy, for
God's sake!  Then you lie in bed for three days and cry about how unfair the
world is.  How did I raise such a failure?<p><b>SANDI:</b> (voice over) By example, Ms. Ex-news anchor.  You've been whining about the past for my whole life.<p><b>LINDA:</b> Now you get to school, and do
whatever it takes to put your club back together.  You need that club to stay
popular.  Or do you want to be nobody for the rest of high
school?<p>
<b>SANDI:</b>  (self-pitying) What did being popular get me? 
Nobody's ever been interested in me, for me.  I don't have any real friends; the
others were only there because of the club.  Every date I've ever had was only
in it for the implied popularity of dating the club president; they weren't
interested in me.  God, what I wouldn't give for a real
boyfriend!<p>
<b>LINDA:</b> (unsympathetic) Well, you aren't going to find one
by crying in your bedroom, so get to school.<p>
<b>Interior. Computer
Lab.</b><p>
<b>The Computer Lab is an ordinary Lawndale High classroom, except
that the desks have been replaced with tables.  On each table are two computers.
The room seems to be under construction: opened boxes sit by each desk, piles of
wire and half-assembled computers sit on some tables, and a large garbage can,
overflowing with cardboard and paper, stands next to the teachers desk.  In the
front corner, near the desk, is a closet door.</b><p><i>Mr. O'Neill sits at the
desk in front of the room and Upchuck stands next to it.  Daria walks into the
room.  All are dressed as usual.  Mr. O'Neill is writing on some papers.  He
stops and looks up as Daria enters.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Ms. Li said that you
needed to see me?<p><b>O'NEILL:</b> Oh, I did? (thinks) Oh, I did!  The new
computers that Lawndale Cable donated to the school have arrived.  Charles has
been setting them up with me, but we can't figure out how to make them connect
to the cable network.  Angela said that your internship has something to do with
computer networks, and she thought you could make it work.<p><i>Daria's eyes
narrow.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> She pulled me out of History so I could install
computers?  I see schoolwork is being held in even lower regard than
usual.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b>  Grrr... Feisty!<p><i>Daria glares at Upchuck, who
takes a step backwards.</i><p><b>O'NEILL:</b> (uncertain) Um.  Well, schoolwork
is important.  (thinks)  But you're doing very well in history aren't you? 
Missing one class won't mean that much, and nobody else understands how these
things work.  (pleading) Please?<p><i>Mr. O'Neill looks like he's about to cry.
Daria looks unsettled at the prospect.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> (quickly) What's in
it for me?<p><b>O'NEILL:</b> (uncertain) A working computer
lab?<p><b>DARIA:</b> I'm going to get that, sooner or later, anyway.  Our dear
principal just doesn't want to part with the money it would take to hire a real
expert to install them.<p><i>Mr. O'Neill fiddles with his pen, trying to avoid
talking until he decides how to respond without agreeing.</i><p><b>O'NEILL:</b>
How about a pass to let you use the lab after school, until the building closes
at five?<p><b>DARIA:</b> That, and a pass to let me spend my study hall periods
in here writing.<p><b>O'NEILL:</b> Oh, well, I don't know.  You're supposed to
spend study hall actually studying.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Do you know any student who
does?  I spend mine writing.  I just do it on paper.  I'd much rather use a
keyboard.<p><i>Mr. O'Neill thinks briefly, then pulls some papers out of his
briefcase, and writes out what looks like a hall pass.</i><p><b>O'NEILL:</b>
There.  How soon can you have it working?<p><b>DARIA:</b> I don't know; are you
going to help?<p><i>He looks at the clock on the wall.</i><p><b>O'NEILL:</b>
I'm afraid I can't, I need to teach a class in five minutes.<p><b>DARIA:</b>
Then it won't take as long.  Do we have all the necessary parts and
tools?<p><b>O'NEILL:</b> I don't know.  But Charles can help you find anything
you need.<p><i>Upchuck smiles at Daria.  Daria grimaces.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b>
(voice over) I knew there would be a catch. (to O'Neill) I'm sure he
will.<p><i>Mr. O'Neill stands, puts away his papers, and rapidly makes his
escape.  Daria turns to Upchuck.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Alright, what have you
done so far, and what isn't working?<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> Ah, my little chickadee,
it will be so wonderful to work closely by your side.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Upchuck,
if you get any closer to my side than is absolutely necessary, you'll be eating
through a straw for the rest of the year.  Do I make myself perfectly
clear?<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> (not the least put off) Crystal clear, my dear Ms. M. 
I exist only to serve.  (suggestively) In any way you'd like me
to.<p><b>DARIA:</b>  Go to hell, Upchuck.  But first show me the equipment and
tools.<p><b>Begin video montage showing scenes of the two
working:</b><p><i>Upchuck, pulling tools, wires and small electronics equipment
out of boxes and showing them to Daria.</i><p><i>Upchuck, working on a computer
across the room, while Daria stares at an electronic circuit board with a
puzzled look.</i><p><i>Daria, running wires along the tabletops, and down along
the floor at one side of the room.  Upchuck stands about five feet away,
watching.</i><p><i>Daria, standing in the closet connecting wires to a box
mounted on the wall.  Upchuck stands about three feet behind her, apparently
offering advice.</i><p><b>End video montage.</b><p><i>Daria walks out of the
computer classroom, brushing her hands with a satisfied smile.  Behind her,
Upchuck's legs can be seen protruding from the garbage can amid the
cardboard.</i><p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> (muffled) I was only trying to help!  Daria? 
Daria?  Anybody?<p><i>The legs continue kicking, as Daria pulls the door closed
behind her, cutting off Upchucks voice.</i><p><b>Interior.  School
Hallway.</b><p><i>Sandi is walking down the hall by herself.  Her hair isn't
quite perfect, and some of the shadow under her eyes can still be seen.  The
overall effect is that she looks haggard.  Various other students are milling
about between classes.  Ahead, Stacy is just closing a locker.  She is alone. 
Sandi walks up to her.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> Stacy?<p><i>Stacy turns to look at
Sandi, with a panicky expression.</i><p><b>STACY:</b> Sandi?  Uh,
hi.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Look, Stacy, I wanted to say I'm sorry.  You were right
about me taking you for granted.<p><i>Stacy seems
surprised.</i><p><b>STACY:</b>  I was?  Y... Yes, I was!<p><b>SANDI:</b> 
Look, if you'll rejoin the club.  I won't hold it against you.  And I'll pay
more attention to your needs in the future.  How's that?<p><b>STACY:</b>
(offended) You won't hold it against me?  Hold what, telling you the truth?  For
a minute there I thought you'd actually changed, but you're still as arrogant as
ever.<p><i>Stacy turns and marches off rapidly.  Sandi just stands
there.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> (speaking loudly) Wait, Stacy, I didn't mean it like
that!<p><i>Stacy keeps walking, as the students turn to look at Sandi.  Sandi
glares back at them.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> (haughty) Don't you people have
somewhere to be? (voice over) Way to go, Griffin, you really showed her that you
wanted to be friends.  Now what?<p><b>Exterior.  Sidewalk -
Day.</b><p><i>Daria and Jane are walking along the
sidewalk.</i><p><b>JANE:</b> Working with Upchuck, yet another thing Ms. Li
will answer for in the afterlife.<p><b>DARIA:</b> The phrase "politics makes
strange bedfellows" has new meaning for me.<p><b>JANE:</b> (teasing) I do hope
you don't mean that literally.<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> As Quinn would say, "Eww!" 
(beat) Don't even joke about that.<p>
<i>Jane chuckles.</i><p><b>JANE:</b>
Speaking of whom, do you think anyone ever rescued him?<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> Should
I care?<p>
<b>JANE:</b> Well, if he suffocated in the trash, the smell would
make the room really unpleasant to work in.<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> You have a point. 
(beat)  Mr. O'Neill said he was going to the lab after I told him that I'd fixed
the network, so I expect he found Upchuck.<p>
<b>JANE:</b> You wouldn't have
suggested he visit, would you?<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> Who, me?  I categorically deny
it, and there were no witnesses, so you can't prove I'm lying.<p>
<b>JANE:</b>
Softie.  (beat)  So, did you see the notice on the bulletin
board?<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> The one about the school trip next month?  What about
it?<p>
<b>JANE:</b>  Want to go?  It's only $25 for an overnight trip to the
mountains, with a night at a real ski lodge.<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> In the off-season,
with two days of hiking up hills and nature walks.  Have you gone completely
insane?  You remember what happened the last time we went to the mountains,
don't you?  This time I won't let my mother bribe me to go.  (beat)  Last time I
had to bribe you to come with me, why the change of heart?<p>
<b>JANE:</b> I've
been painting landscapes lately, and I want to sketch some mountains for
reference.<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> So, you want me to come, spend my days hiking with
the usual idiots, and my evenings watching you draw madly?  Explain to me why
this is better than staying home with a good book.<p><b>JANE:</b> Because it's
a school sponsored trip, but it's open to any student.  You could invite Tom. 
Just think, a romantic weekend in a ski lodge, with your
sweetheart.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Jane, there's something really sick about you
trying to fix me up on a romantic weekend escape with your ex-boyfriend so
you'll have company while you draw.<p><b>JANE:</b> Hey, I'll do anything for my
art.<p><i>Daria just looks at Jane.</i><p><b>JANE:</b> So, will you go?  I
really don't want to be the only non-outdoorsy type on the trip.  I need someone
to bury my dehydrated corpse by the trailside after I expire from two days of
hiking.<p><b>DARIA:</b> What a pleasant thought.  A romantic weekend with Tom
and your corpse.  What the hell.  I'll ask Tom.  If he doesn't think you're too
crazy to be near, we'll go.<p><b>JANE:</b>  I knew you'd see it my
way.<p><b>Exterior.  High Hills Park - Tuesday Afternoon.</b><p><i>Sandi is
sitting, alone, on a bench next to a path alongside a grassy field, watching a
flock of birds peck at the grass.  She's eating french fries out of a paper bag.
Occasionally she throws a handful of fries to the birds.  Although she doesn't
look as haggard as yesterday, she's still not her usual elegant
self.</i><p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> (seductive voice) The divine Ms. Griffin, skipping
school.  And eating fatty foods.  What has the world come to?<p><i>Sandi
starts, and looks up to see Upchuck walking down the path towards
her.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> (unwelcoming) Charles.  What are you doing
here?<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> (more normal voice) Avoiding Ms. Barch's class; I've
had enough pain for one week.<p><i>A grin flits across Sandi's face, then
disappears.  Upchuck walks over, and sits down on the bench.  He leers
suggestively over at Sandi.</i><p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> (back to the seductive voice)
I know a few ways we could pass the time...<p><b>SANDI:</b> (disgusted) Grow up
Charles.  I wouldn't shake your hand if you were the last man on Earth, much
less do anything else.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> (normal) Can't blame a guy for
trying.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Yes I can.  Haven't you ever heard of sexual
harassment?<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> (suggestive) Errr... Feisty!<p>
<b>SANDI:</b> 
Give it a rest already!<p>
<b>UPCHUCK:</b> (normal voice) So, where's the rest
of your mob?  I don't see any clothing stores around here.<p>
<b>SANDI:</b> 
(defensive) There's more to me than just fashion!  I can enjoy an afternoon in
the park without clothes.  (beat)  Uh, that didn't come out right.  I mean, I
can enjoy things other than fashion.<p>
<b>UPCHUCK:</b>  (suggestive) Grr...  I
liked it better the first time.  (normal)  Still, I come here fairly often, and
I've never seen you.  You're risking a suspension if you're caught off school
grounds.  Is something wrong?<p>
<b>SANDI:</b>  (self-pitying) Why would you
care?  I've never been nice to you once.<p>
<b>UPCHUCK:</b> You're the only
student in the whole school who uses my real name, and you've never stuffed me
in a trashcan.  That counts as "nice" in my book.<p>
<b>SANDI:</b>  But I only
use it because I can't stand gross things, and your nickname is
gross.<p>
<b>UPCHUCK:</b>  Hey, don't blame me.  I didn't pick it.  Anyway,
while you may never have been nice to me, there's always hope, and you've never
hurt me.<p>
<b>SANDI:</b> Then you're probably the only one in school who can
say that.  My supposed friends all hate me, and I can't really blame them.  I've
been a real bitch.<p>
<b>UPCHUCK:</b> (apparently genuine curiosity) How
so?<p>
<i>Sandi stops to think briefly before speaking.</i><p>
<b>SANDI:</b> I
got caught up in keeping the fashion club popular, but I lost track of why I
created it in the first place, as a way to spend time with my friends, doing
things we liked.  I wanted people to like me, but I never showed them "me", just
the club president.  Now Stacy, my best friend since kindergarten, hates me
because I thought the clubs popularity was more important than her passing
O'Neill's class.<p>
<b>UPCHUCK:</b> Well, I can't say that I blame her.  That's
no way to treat a friend.<p>
<b>SANDI:</b> (annoyed) Oh, like you have lots of
experience with how to treat friends.  Do you even have any
friends?<p>
<b>UPCHUCK:</b> (hurt) No.  But if I did, I'd know better than to
take them for granted.<p>
<b>SANDI:</b> (contrite) I'm sorry, that was mean of
me.  But, why don't you have any friends?  I know why girls avoid you, but don't
you get along with the guys?<p>
<b>UPCHUCK:</b> No, they think I'm weird too. 
I'm smart, and I'm not into sports, and they know how unsuccessful I am with
girls. Pure geek.  (bitter)  And my parents only buy me these geeky clothes. 
Who wears slacks and dress shirts in high school?<p><b>SANDI:</b>  Don't you
get an allowance?  Buy clothes you like.  Besides, your clothes aren't that bad.
It's your attitude that scares people off.  Although a polo shirt and leather
shoes would look better with those pants than the dress shirt and
sneakers.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b>  Heh, fashion tips for the outcast.  You could
write a book and make a killing.  (beat) My father is on the school board.  If I
changed what I wear to school, he'd hear about it fairly quickly.  This is his
idea of what a "successful young man" should wear.<p><b>SANDI:</b>  God, and I
thought my mother was a controlling bitch!<p><i>Sandi sits and looks at the
birds, throwing them a few fries to keep their interest.  After a while, Upchuck
speaks again.</i><p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> So, I understand why Stacy's mad at you,
but what about the others?<p><b>SANDI:</b>  Well, I blamed Quinn and her cousin
for Stacy's behavior.  Quinn gets defensive about her cousin, although she's the
first one to complain about how annoyingly she behaves at home.  I don't know
what's up with Tiffany.  She keeps hanging up when I call.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b>
Quinn's cousin?  What cousin?<p><b>SANDI:</b>  You know, the weird girl who
always wears that horrible green jacket.  What a fashion
disaster.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b>  You mean Daria?  Quinn's sister?<p><b>SANDI:</b>
(dismissive) Like hell!  They don't even look alike.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> I'm
serious.  How could you not know?  Everyone knows who Daria is.<p><b>SANDI:</b>
(worried) No!  Quinn told me... (pauses, with a thoughtful look) Oh, another
lie.<p><i>Sandy leans forward, and puts her face in her hands, and appears to
be crying.  Upchuck has no idea how to react.  He starts to lean towards
her.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> (muffled) Don't touch me!<p><i>Upchuck backs
off.</i><p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> Sorry.  (he waits, while her sobbing subsides)  So,
did you try making up with Stacy?<p><i>Sandi looks up, with the tracks of tears
on her cheeks.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> Yes.  I apologized, or at least I tried to. 
But I said it wrong, and she thought I just wanted to get her back in the
club.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> So, why do you need the club?  Why not just try to be
friends with her?<p><b>SANDI:</b> But the club is what makes us
popular!<p><i>Sandi sits up, pulls out a tissue and compact, and begins fixing
her makeup.</i><p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> Do you want to be popular, or do you want to
be friends with Stacy?  Maybe you should pick one, and try for it first, before
you work on the other.<p><b>SANDI:</b> You mean scrap the club and just be
friends?<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> Well, you said you wanted people to like you for
yourself.  It seems like that would be difficult if all they see is a club
president.<p><i>Sandi gets a determined look on her face.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b>
Yes, you're right.  Stacy first, the others later, and then the club if I still
want it.  (she turns to Upchuck) You know, you can be almost human if you try. 
If you try more often, maybe someday someone will be willing to shake your
hand.<p><i>Upchuck is taken aback.</i><p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> You?<p><b>SANDI:</b>
When hell freezes over, maybe, but don't count on it.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b>
(chuckles) Fair enough. But I'm not giving up.<p><b>SANDI:</b> I'd be
flattered, if you didn't say the same thing to every female in the
school.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> Oh, I don't restrict myself to just the
school.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Ugh!  Charles, I'll let you in on a big secret.  Women
like men who make them feel special.  You make a woman feel like the tenth side
of beef in a meat locker.  Pick someone, preferably someone who's never met you
before, and treat them like an individual.  You may be surprised.<p><i>Sandi
puts away her makeup, stands up, and throws the remainder of the bag of fries to
the birds.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> Thanks for talking to me Charles, it
helped.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> Anytime.  (he leers at her) Anyplace.<p><i>Sandi
chuckles as she walks away.  Upchuck's leer fades, and the sits there with a
thoughtful look on his face.</i><p><b>Interior.  Pizza Place -
Evening.</b><p><b>Quinn, Stacy and Tiffany sit in a booth, eating no-cheese
pizza.  The three J's (Joey, Jeffy, and Jamie) sit in an adjacent booth,
although they are also eating pizza, they seem to be trying to listen to the
girls' conversation.  Jamie sits across the table from the other two, furthest
from the conversation.  The view zooms in on the booth with the three
girls.</b><p><b>QUINN:</b> So, like, it's a real ski lodge, with a fireplace
and oil lamps and everything.  I found a brochure at the travel store in the
mall.<p><b>STACY:</b> Wow, Quinn, that is like, so cool.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b>
Yeah.  But it's too early to ski, isn't it?<p><b>QUINN:</b> Tiffany, dear, the
purpose of going to a ski lodge is to be seen enjoying yourself, not to actually
do anything.<p><i>Tiffany frowns, seeming to doubt this statement, although
Stacy is nodding right along.</i><p><b>TIFFANY:</b> (wistful) I don't know, I
think I'd like to learn how to ski.  It must be fun to go flying down a
mountain.  Like sledding when we were kids.<p><b>QUINN:</b> But think of what
windburn would do to your skin. (shudders)  Besides, it's too early to ski,
there's just hiking and stuff.<p><b>Cut to:</b> the adjacent booth.<p><i>Joey
and Jeffy are listening closely, Jamie appears to be too far away to hear what's
being said.</i><p><b>JAMIE:</b>  (quietly) What was that, did Quinn say she
wanted to learn to ski?<p><i>The other two make "shushing" motions at him, and
continue trying to listen.  Then they turn back and lean over the table to
talk.</i><p><b>JOEY:</b> (quietly) No, Tiffany wants to learn to ski, Quinn
wants to hang out at the lodge.<p><b>JAMIE:</b>  (quietly) That's great, I can
get her a hot chocolate!<p><b>JEFFY:</b> (less quietly) No, I can!<p><b>Cut
to:</b> the girls' booth.<p><i>Sounds of conflict come from off-screen.  The
three girls have stopped their conversation and are listening to the sounds. 
Quinn is smiling.</i><p><b>STACY:</b> (to Quinn) Sounds like your fan club is
at it again.<p><b>QUINN:</b> (dreamily, and not loud enough to carry to the
boys) No, guys, stop it.  You can all get me hot chocolates.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b>
But Quinn, hot chocolate is SOO fattening.<p><b>QUINN:</b> (practical) I didn't
say I'd drink them.<p><i>The other two nod at this wisdom.</i><p><b>Interior. 
Ms. Li's Office.</b><p><b>Sandi is standing before Ms. Li's desk.  Ms. Li is
sitting behind the desk, with an annoyed expression on her face.</b><p><b>MS
LI:</b> (upset) What do you mean you're dissolving the fashion club?  What about
the winter fashion show you were going to give in November. (quieter) I've
already had the tickets printed, dammit.<p><b>SANDI:</b> (cool and collected)
There isn't a club to give a fashion show anymore.  The others all quit, and
there's nobody else in the school qualified to join.  I'm sorry to let you down,
but I can't give a show all by myself.<p><b>MS LI:</b> You're the president of
the club, you're supposed to keep the rest of them in line.  That's what being
the boss is all about.  How could you let this happen?<p><b>SANDI:</b> Being
the boss is how I got them to quit.  They aren't even talking to me
now.<p><b>MS LI:</b> (thoughtful) I'd heard that you had been absent from
several of your classes lately.  Is that because of this split?<p><b>SANDI:</b>
(upset) I can't sit next to them!  Everyone would know we weren't
talking!<p><b>MS LI:</b> I doubt "everyone" cares, but that's beside the point.
We can't have you skipping class.  I'll arrange to have your seating changed,
but you need to go to class.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Thank you, I'll be there if I
don't need to sit with them.<p><i>Ms. Li picks up a sheet of paper from a pile
on her desk and reads it briefly.</i><p><b>MS LI:</b> However, we still have
the problem of the money we've already spent for the show.  How were you
planning to pay back the school?<p><b>SANDI:</b> (surprised) But I didn't spend
it, and I don't have any money to pay you back!<p><b>MS LI:</b> Well, it just
so happens we're short one volunteer for the school trip.  How would you like to
be a trail guide?  Or shall I tell your mother about the
absences?<p><b>SANDI:</b> Uh, I guess I could do that.  It's just walking,
right?<p><b>Interior. Computer Lab.</b><p><b>Upchuck is setting up the last
couple of machines in the back of the room.  The trashcan is no longer present. 
His usual shirt has been replaced with a blue polo shirt.  Daria
enters.</b><p><b>DARIA:</b> Hello Upchuck, Mr. O'Neill said you had some more
systems ready to be set up, and needed my help.  I thought you were watching
what I did last time so you could finish the others yourself.  If this is just a
ruse, you're going to have fond memories of that trashcan.<p><i>Upchuck looks
up, and speaks in a strangely polite (for him) and businesslike
voice.</i><p>
<b>UPCHUCK:</b> No Daria, I'm really having a problem with these
two.  I put the cards in the way you did, and the software seems right, but I'm
not even getting a link light on them.<p>
<i>Daria seems surprised at the
absence of his usual behavior.  She walks over and looks at the back of the
machine, pulling a cable out to examine it.</i><p>
<b>DARIA:</b> Hmm, did you
try another cable?<p>
<b>UPCHUCK:</b> No, these are the only two cables long
enough to reach this far.<p>
<i>Daria looks at the cable, and then walks into
the closet in the front of the room.</i><p>
<b>DARIA:</b> (off screen) Ah
ha!<p>
<i>She walks out and over to the toolkit, pulling out a plier-like tool
and walking back to the computer.</i><p>
<b>DARIA:</b> It's the wrong kind of
cable.  This is one you'd use to connect two computers directly for gaming, not
the kind you need to build a network.<p>
<b>UPCHUCK</b>: Then we need to get
another cable?<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> Nope, we just need to fix this one.<p>
<i>She
quickly clips the connector off the cable, strips some wire, and puts a new
connector on the end.</i><p>
<b>DARIA:</b> I made a couple of these the other
day at work, so I should remember how it goes.  (she plugs the new connector
into the computer) Try it now.<p><i>Upchuck types on the computer, and looks
up.</i><p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> You fixed it!<p><i>Daria smiles, and holds up the
tool, blowing on the end like a gunfighter blowing smoke from the barrel of a
pistol.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> (fake western accent) Dern tootin,
Tex.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> Could you show me how to do that?<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> Sure.
(suddenly suspicious) But you keep your hands to yourself, got
it?<p>
<b>UPCHUCK:</b> (holding up his hands, palm out) No hands!
Promise!<p>
<i>Daria pulls the cable from the second
computer.</i><p>
<b>DARIA:</b> Okay, see how the little wire colors go? The two
ends should be the same, but they aren't.<p>
<b>Fade out and back
in.</b><p>
<i>Daria is sitting on the desk, watching Upchuck fix the cable and
connect it to the computer.</i><p>
<b>UPCHUCK:</b> It's working.  (he looks up
smiling)  Thank you, Daria.<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> No problem, Upchuck.  Now O'Neill
has one less reason to waste my time.<p>
<b>UPCHUCK:</b> (less happy) True.  Um,
could you call me "Chuck"?<p>
<i>Daria reacts with
surprise.</i><p>
<b>DARIA:</b> Keep behaving like a human, and I'll think about
it.<p>
<i>She gets up, and walks out of the room.  Upchuck gazes fondly after
her.</i><p>
<b>Exterior.  High Hills Park - Two weeks later.</b><p><b>Fall has
come to the park, and the trees have begun to shed their leaves.  The ones that
remain are a riot of bright colors.  Upchuck is sitting on a park bench, still
wearing a blue polo shirt rather than his usual dress shirt, with a light jacket
over it.  Sandi approaches, wearing her blue hooded sweater (from "Groped by an
Angel") over her usual clothes.  She is back to her normal fashionable
appearance.  Some small children are playing in the distance, but nobody is
nearby.</b><p><b>SANDI:</b> (ironic) Hi Charles, what a surprise to see you
here.<p><i>Sandi sits on the bench, a couple of feet from Upchuck, who laughs
briefly, and mimes flicking the ashes off a cigar.</i><p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> (bad
Groucho Marx voice) We've got to stop meeting like this!<p><i>Sandi laughs, a
remarkably carefree sound.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> (still amused) What WOULD people
think?<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> (serious) Nothing good.  And with my reputation,
nothing like the truth.<p><b>SANDI:</b> (serious) Yes, well, we just have to
not let them find out.  (introspective)  Who would have thought you and I would
have anything in common?<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> Being ostracized?<p><b>SANDI:</b>
(confused) Ostrich sized?  I don't have a long neck.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> No,
ostracized, it means being an outcast.<p><b>SANDI:</b> (downbeat) Oh.  I wish
you wouldn't remind me how dumb I am by using words only a brain would
know.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> A weak vocabulary doesn't make you dumb, just
uneducated.  That's something you can fix.<p><b>SANDI:</b> (annoyed) Don't
patronize me.  I know I could learn stuff if I wanted to, I just don't think I
need to.  You learn all these useless facts that you'll never need to know
again, and what does it get you?  Knowing that stuff doesn't make you better
than anyone, and I don't want to be the kind of person who thinks it does. 
(ironic) I'm quite capable of being arrogant without it.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> And
how is your reconciliation with Stacy going?  Still getting the cold
shoulder?<p><b>SANDI:</b> Well, she'll talk to me in class now.  But she won't
accept any of my invitations to go out for pizza or shopping together.  I guess
it's progress, but not much.  She's going on the trip this weekend, and Ms. Li
forced me into being one of the volunteers, so maybe we'll be able to talk alone
then and patch things up.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> Oh, I didn't know you were going on
the trip.  I'll be there also.  (beat) Daria's going.<p><b>SANDI:</b> You're
really serious about her, aren't you?<p><i>Upchuck nods.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b>
You know she has a boyfriend?  And the only person in school who likes you less
than her is that Goth chick.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> Yeah, I know.  It's pretty
hopeless, but I have to try.  (beat) I only hope we don't end up climbing any
real mountains.<p><b>SANDI:</b> (humorously) You're not the athletic type, are
you?<p><i>Upchuck chuckles, taking the jibe in good
spirit.</i><p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> No, that's not it. (he hesitates, then speaks
cautiously)  I'm afraid of heights.  I can't even climb a ladder without getting
nauseous.<p><b>SANDI:</b> I didn't know that.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> Nobody knows
it.  If I told anyone, they'd use it against me somehow.<p><b>SANDI:</b> But
you're telling me?<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> I trust you.  If you were going to pull
something, you wouldn't have pretended to be my friend for this
long.<p><b>SANDI:</b>  (bluntly) I'm not your friend, we're just fellow
ostriches, or whatever.  (beat)  But your secret is safe with me
anyway.<p><i>The two sit quietly, looking at some children playing with a ball
in the distance. Sandi wears a thoughtful look.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b>
(hesitantly) Charles, being on this trip with Stacy and the others is my big
chance to win her friendship back.  Promise me you won't talk to me, or do
anything that would make people think we like each other.
Please?<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> (bitter) You know I wouldn't do anything to hurt
you.<p><b>SANDI:</b> (quietly) I know, and I'm sorry, but I had to be
sure.<p><b>Interlude (a video montage with music):</b><p><i>Stacy walking away

<b>Establishing shot: Exterior. Cold Springs
Ski Lodge - Early Saturday Morning.</b><p>
<b>The lodge is a rustic, three story
wooden building, with a vaguely log-cabin look, with a railed porch on the
front.  It backs up against a small lake.  Over to the right is what appears to
be a marsh, to the left rise mountains, with a small ski lift (chairs hung from
an overhead line).  The tops of the mountains are snowy, but around the lodge
the ground is clear.  A thin trail of smoke rises from the chimney at one end of
the lodge.</b><p>
<b>Interior.  Lodge Lobby.</b><p>
<b>The scene opens with a
slow clockwise pan around the main room of the lodge, which occupies most of the
ground floor.  We begin at a small staircase, pan right past a fireplace
containing a small fire, in front of which are a pair of couches and numerous
chairs and end tables.  We continue to the front door, then past it to a lounge
area with tables and chairs, set for a meal, a bar is against the far wall.  The
pan continues past another staircase, a mirror image of the first, to end on the
reception counter.  From the carpet runner on the floor, we can see that the
counter is opposite the front door.</b><p>
<i>A late-middle-aged man, the
manager, stands behind the counter.  Bill, the lodge handyman, stands in front
of the counter, wearing overalls and a tool belt.  He's younger than the
manager, but not by much.  He's wearing boots, and wet footprints trail from him
to the stairs on the left.  Bill speaks in a matter-of-fact tone, while the
managers emotions are more volatile.</i><p>
<b>BILL:</b> It's a right mess.  The
water leak didn't just soak the third floor hallway, room 203 was practically a
swimming pool.  It's going to take days to dry it out.<p>
<b>MANAGER:</b>
(nervously excited) But we need that room for the school kids!  They're due in
another three hours!  We'll have to open another room!<p>
<b>BILL:</b> There
ain't no other rooms to open, least not with double beds.  And the others are
all up on three anyway, I thought you wanted to keep them all on the second
floor.<p>
<b>MANAGER:</b> (still excited) God yes, I need to keep them near
their chaperones.  Can you imagine the trouble a busload of high schoolers could
get into on their own?  (decisive)  Okay, open up the honeymoon
suite.<p>
<b>BILL:</b> But it's only got one bed.<p>
<b>MANAGER:</b>
(exasperated) Then put in one of the trundle beds, for God's sake!  Do I need to
tell you everything?<p>
<b>BILL:</b> Calm down.  There's plenty of time before
they get here.  We'll be ready.<p>
<b>Exterior. Lodge - Noon.</b><p><i>A school
bus full of Lawndale High students arrives in front of the lodge.  Mr. O'Neill
staggers out, looking ill.  Ms. Barch jumps down, full of energy, and the
students begin to stream out.</i><p>
<b>BARCH:</b> Okay folks, let's keep it
organized.  Two lines, girls over by the door, and you males back there.  Leave
your luggage on the bus for now, you can pick it up after you get your room
assignments.  (to O'Neill) Skinny, you get them ready, I'll go talk to the
manager.<p>
<i>O'Neill leans on the front fender of the bus, fumbling with his
inhaler.</i><p><b>O'NEILL:</b> Okay, Janet, as soon as I get my breath.  (gasp)
Gas fumes on the bus.  Too much pollen out here.<p><b>BARCH:</b> Pollen? In
October?  Gods above, skinny.  (she turns to Sandi)  Ms. Griffin, time to start
earning your pay.  Get these people organized.  Draft some of the males to
unload the luggage from the bus, and then stick with it to make sure the right
people get the right bags.<p><i>Ms. Barch marches into the lodge, as Sandi
turns to the three J's.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> Joey, Jeffy, Jonathon.  Unload the
bags and stack them over there (she points to the porch of the
lodge).<p><b>JAMIE:</b> It's Jamie!  Why can't anyone ever remember my
name?<p><b>JOEY:</b> I'll get Quinn's bags!<p><b>JEFFY:</b> No, I
will!<p><b>SANDI:</b> I'm sure she has enough for all of you to carry one each,
just unload the other bags too.<p><b>Cut to:</b> Quinn, Stacy and Tiffany,
standing in line.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Looks like Sandi's found a new reason to
boss people around.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Well, it's not like Ms. Li gave her any
choice.  She had to do this because we broke up the club.  In a way, it's our
fault too.<p><b>Cut to:</b> Daria and Jane, elsewhere in the
line.<p><b>JANE:</b> So, Upchuck was being very polite to you on the bus, and I
didn't hear a single lewd suggestion out of him the whole trip.  (teasing)
Somebody's got herself an admirer.<p><b>DARIA:</b> The lake out back looks deep
and cold; they'd never find your body.<p><b>JANE:</b> Hey, I wasn't suggesting
you do anything, just making an observation!<p><b>DARIA:</b> (serious) Yeah,
he's been like this for weeks.  It was easier to deal with the old Upchuck.  I
can't cripple someone for being polite.<p><b>JANE:</b> Why not?  Obnoxious is
obnoxious, no matter how he sugarcoats it.<p><i>Daria just looks at
Jane.</i><p><b>BARCH:</b> (off screen) Okay, girls first.  It's two to a room,
so if you want to pair with someone, stay together.  Otherwise we'll pick
someone for you.  And no changes once you get a room assignment, we're only here
for one night anyway.<p><i>The line begins to move.</i><p><b>Fade out and back
in.</b><p><i>Sandi is standing by a very small pile of luggage.  Ms. Barch
walks up.</i><p><b>BARCH:</b> Okay, that's the last of them.  Here's your room
key, you're in room 200, just at the top of the left set of stairs.  We're
having lunch in a half hour, then a hike.  You're off-duty until the hike
begins.  Go get settled.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Thanks Ms. Barch.<p><b>BARCH:</b>
Thank you, Sandi, you did a good job keeping the luggage organized.  (bitter)
Unlike a certain man.<p><b>Interior.  Honeymoon Suite.</b><p><b>Sandi opens
the door with her arms full of bags, as it swings in we see the number "200" on
the door.  The room is large, with a bureau and king-sized, heart-shaped, canopy
bed on the right, and a small sitting area with a couch, table, and two chairs
on the left.  At the far end of the room are large windows and a sliding glass
door onto a balcony.  A Jacuzzi and a small table and chair can be seen through
the glass.  Across from the bed, a louvered door opens into a bathroom, where
water can be heard running.  Just past the bathroom door, a small rollaway bed
has been placed against the wall.</b><p><i>Sandi walks in, and kicks the door
closed behind her.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b>  Hello, anybody here?<p><i>She walks
over to the couch and drops her bags, as the running water cuts out, and Stacy
emerges from the bathroom.</i><p><b>STACY:</b> (dismayed) Sandi?  You're my
roommate?<p><b>SANDI:</b> Looks like it.  You don't need to sound so unhappy,
it's only one night.  (beat)  So, you mind if I take the small
bed?<p><b>STACY:</b>  (confused) You want me to take the big
one?<p><b>SANDI:</b> Hey, a beds a bed to me, but I know you like canopy
beds.<p><b>STACY:</b> Oh.  (smiles)  Thanks Sandi.<p><b>Exterior. 
Lodge.</b><p><b>The students are forming up in a rough line, two-by-two, in
front of the lodge.  Ms. Barch is walking around organizing
people.</b><p><i>Ms. Barch moves to the head of the
line.</i><p><b>BARCH:</b> Okay, Mr. O'Neill needs to lie down and recover from
the trip.  Like any other man; never there when you need 'em.  I'll be leading
this hike.  We're going to go around the lake.  It's all level ground, so I
don't expect anyone to fall behind.  Ms. Griffin will be bringing up the rear to
make sure we don't lose anyone.  Anyone who doesn't keep up will answer to me. 
Got it?  (beat) Let's go!<p><i>The line starts to move.  Sandi stands at the
back of the line, alone and looking forlorn.  As the line moves out, it reveals
Quinn, Stacy, and Tiffany standing by the corner of the lodge.  They wait until
Sandi walks up, and then fall in alongside her.</i><p><b>STACY:</b> We decided
you could use some company.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Barch is really working you hard,
isn't she?<p><b>SANDI:</b> (touched) Thanks, guys.  I really appreciate this. 
(to Quinn)  Well, it is my job, and it's not really difficult.  I've had lots of
practice being bossy.<p><i>Tiffany laughs outright, and Quinn and Stacy
chuckle.</i><p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Stacy was right; you have changed.<p><i>This is
the first time Tiffany has spoken in Sandi's presence since the club broke up,
and Sandi is surprised by the change in her behavior.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> I
don't seem to be the only one.<p><i>Tiffany looks blank, then realizes what she
means.</i><p><b>TIFFANY:</b> I don't need to be afraid of you kicking me out of
the club if I think for myself now.<p><i>Sandi frowns.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b>
(unhappy) Oh.  (beat) You must hate me.<p><b>TIFFANY</b>: I did.  But I also
miss going shopping with you.  I'm willing to give you a
chance.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Oh.  Thanks.  (looks at Quinn)  And
you?<p><b>QUINN:</b> I never hated you Sandi, but I do like you better this
way.<p><i>Sandi looks up at Stacy, thoughtfully.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> You
already told me how you felt. (looks around at all three) I just want to
apologize to all of you for being such a bitch.  It's what I thought I needed to
do, to keep us popular.  (beat)  It's what my mother told me I needed to do to
stay in charge.  I'm sorry.<p><b>QUINN:</b> It's okay, Sandi.  We're just four
friends now, with no club to make us argue.<p><b>STACY:</b> Yeah, and when we
get back home, we can go shopping again.  Cashmans is having a mid-week
sale.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Yeah!<p><i>Quinn and Sandi both smile.</i><p><b>Cut
to:</b> The middle of the line.<p><i>Daria is walking with Tom and Jane. 
Upchuck is a short distance ahead of them.</i><p><b>TOM:</b> So that's the
infamous Upchuck?  He seems civil enough.<p><b>JANE:</b> He's been on his best
behavior lately.<p><i>Daria darts a sharp look at Jane.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b>
(quietly) Deep and cold.<p><b>JANE:</b> (quickly) So, any bets on how many
people fall out before we're done?<p><b>DARIA:</b> With Ms. Barch leading? 
Nobody's going to stop moving until they die.  We might as well be on
Baatan.<p><b>JANE:</b> Huh?<p><b>TOM:</b> A famous march of allied prisoners
of war in World War II.  Thousands died.<p><b>JANE:</b> That's it, you two
talk.  I'm drawing.<p><i>She stops and lifts her sketchbook, and quickly
sketches an outline of the mountains on the far side of the lake.  Daria and Tom
stop a ways off, and look out over the lake, as the line moves slowly past
them.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Sorry you came yet?<p><i>Tom links his arm through
hers.</i><p><b>TOM:</b> Not as long as you're here.<p><i>Daria smiles, and
rests her head on his shoulder.  Up ahead, Upchuck looks back, unnoticed, with a
sad look on his face.</i><p>
<b>Interior.  Lodge - Evening.</b><p>
<b>The
students are sitting around the fireplace.  Some are playing various board
games, while others sit and chat, a few read.  Bill the handyman, now wearing
some kind of waiters uniform, moves about, refilling snack bowls.  Mr. O'Neill
seems to be recovered, and sits by the fireplace, stoking the fire.  A guitar
leans against his chair.  Ms. Barch is in an overstuffed chair near the fire,
apparently asleep.  Quinn and Stacy sit talking, while Tiffany and Sandi are
leafing through an issue of Waif together.  The three J's hover around Quinn,
who ignores them.  Daria and Tom are sitting together, reading separate books. 
Upchuck sits alone, off to one side.  Jane is nowhere to be
seen.</b><p>
<i>Outside, the wind gusts, rattling the windows.  Rain can be
heard pelting the side of the building.  There's a sudden crack of thunder, and
the lights all go out.  The fireplace dimly lights the room.  Pandemonium
ensues, with everyone talking at once.  Bill's voice rises above the noise,
talking loudly in a carrying voice, but not shouting.</i><p>
<b>BILL:</b> Now
just be calm kids.  This happens all the time.  They'll get the lines fixed in
the morning once it's light out.  We'll get the oil lights lit, and you won't
even know we've lost power.<p>
<b>Cut to:</b> Tom and Daria.<p><b>DARIA:</b>
Unless you brought an electric toothbrush, like Quinn.<p>
<b>TOM:</b> She
didn't!<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> Plus a hair dryer, and a back massager.  But she's
traveling light; she left the ultrasonic jewelry cleaner at home.<p>
<i>Tom
laughs.</i><p>
<b>DARIA:</b> You think I'm joking?<p>
<b>TOM:</b> No, I was just
wondering what it would be like if she ever had to really rough
it.<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> You mean, go somewhere without a mirror?<p>
<i>Tom
dissolves in laughter.</i><p>
<b>Cut to:</b> Tiffany and Sandi.<p>
<b>SANDI:</b>
I guess we can't finish that article.<p>
<b>TIFFANY:</b> I'm not sure it's a
loss.  The writer didn't seem to understand the difference between brown and
auburn hair for coordinating hair clips.<p><b>SANDI:</b> You think?  I thought
she was just saying that similar colors could be used with both if you were
careful.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> No, it was pretty clear from the colors she listed
in the sidebar that she was confusing the two.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Hmm. That's a
good point.<p><i>Jamie walks up.</i><p><b>JAMIE:</b> Excuse me,
Tiffany?<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Yes, Jamie?<p><b>JAMIE:</b> Hey, you remembered my
name!<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Of course I remembered your name; it's not that
confusing.  What do you want?<p>
<b>JAMIE:</b> Well, I was going to ask you if
Quinn... Never mind, uh, can I get you a diet cola?<p>
<b>TIFFANY:</b> Thank
you, but why don't we go get something together, that way you won't have to
carry drinks back across the room in the dark.  (to Sandi)  Catch you later,
huh?<p>
<b>SANDI:</b> (smiling) Sure.<p>
<i>Tiffany rises, and walks off towards
the bar at the far end of the room with Jamie.  </i><p>
<b>Cut to:</b> Tom and
Daria.<p>
<i>Bill and the manager are moving around the lobby, bringing out and
lighting oil lamps, some in wall holders, others free-standing on tables.  The
resulting light is dim, insufficient for reading.</i><p>
<b>TOM:</b> Well, so
much for reading tonight.<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> Jane has a battery operated camping
light we could use, if she's through with her drawing.<p>
<b>TOM:</b> Actually,
I'd like to talk to you, but away from all these people.  That Upchuck fellow
keeps looking over here, and I either need to get away from him or do something
about it.<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> Okay, lets go, (smiles) but no funny
stuff.<p><b>O'NEILL:</b> (off screen) Who wants to sing campfire
songs?<p><b>Interior.  Hallway.</b><p><i>Daria and Tom walk quietly down the
hall.  Tom is leading, holding an oil lamp.  They approach a
door.</i><p><b>TOM:</b> We can talk in my room.<p><i>Tom opens the door, and
we see Tiffany and Jamie sitting on the bed, kissing.  They're too involved in
each other to notice the door opening.  Tom quickly closes
it.</i><p><b>TOM:</b> Or maybe not, my roommate seems
occupied.<p><b>DARIA:</b> My room should be free of passionate
idiots.<p><i>The two walk down the hall.  Daria opens her door, and we see
Jane, with her back to the door, drawing madly with pastels as she looks out the
window at the moonlit landscape.  Daria closes the door.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b>
Okay, another kind of passion.  We shouldn't disturb her while she's
creating.<p><b>TOM:</b> (smiles fondly) No, she gets very cranky when you do
that.  (beat)  There's a private balcony off the honeymoon suite.  We can use
that; everyone's downstairs.<p><i>Daria shoots a doubtful look at
Tom.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> If you're planning some passion of your own, don't
even think about it.<p>
<i>Tom pulls back from her, and raises his left hand,
palm outwards (he's still holding the oil lamp in his right
hand).</i><p>
<b>TOM:</b> (quickly) Furthest thing from my mind!<p>
<i>Daria,
annoyed, glares at him.</i><p>
<b>TOM:</b> Uh, I didn't mean it like
that!<p>
<i>Daria walks off down the hall.  Tom, with the light,
follows.</i><p>
<b>TOM:</b> Daria, please don't be upset.  I do think of you
like that, I just don't want to push you... (he trails off, as Daria glares at
him over her shoulder)<p><b>DARIA:</b> Tom, just give up before you put your
foot any further down your throat.<p><b>TOM:</b> Right.  (beat)  Here we are. 
(he opens the door, and they enter)<p><b>Interior. Honeymoon
Suite.</b><p><b>The suite is mostly dark. Dim moonlight filters in from the balcony window.</b><p><i>Daria and Tom enter, and close the door behind them. 
They quickly walk to the balcony, on the way Tom grabs a blanket off the
rollaway bed in the corner.  At the balcony, Tom opens the sliding door.  An
overhanging roof above the balcony keeps the rain off, and the main storm seems
to have moved away, only a faint breath of wind can be heard.  They exit onto
the balcony, leaving the door open.</i><p><b>Interior. Hallway.</b><p><i>Sandi
walks down the hall, pointing a flashlight at the floor.  Her face is dimly lit
with reflected light.  Upchuck steps out from an open door.  Reacting in
surprise when he sees her, he looks around quickly to see if anyone else is
about.  Sandi looks around herself.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> It's okay Charles,
everyone's downstairs singing with Mr. O'Neill.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b>
(sympathetically) Ugh.  (in a suggestive voice)  So, what brings you up here in
the dark?  A romantic tryst with someone perhaps?<p><b>SANDI:</b>  God Charles,
I really don't know why I like you.  Knock it off!<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> (contrite)
Sorry.  It's just the way I am.<p><b>SANDI:</b>  You've managed to be polite to
Daria and her friends for three weeks, you could at least try to do the same for
me.  Look, we can't talk here, but I'd really like to talk to you about Stacy. 
We can go in my room, but you have to behave.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> (hurt) You can
depend on me!<p><b>SANDI:</b> That's what I'm afraid of.<p><b>Interior.
Honeymoon Suite.</b><p><i>The two enter the room, and walk towards the
balcony.</i><p><b>Cut to:</b> The balcony.  <p><i>It's a small second-floor
balcony, perhaps twenty feet long, with a Jacuzzi to one side of the sliding
doors, and some large potted plants and a small table to the other side.  There
is no exit other than the door.  Below, the surface of the lake stretches out
behind the lodge.  Tom and Daria are sitting quietly on the floor behind the
Jacuzzi, with their feet hanging off the edge, looking up at the sky.  The oil
lamp is beside them, but it's been turned off.  The rain has stopped, although
distant rumbling thunder can be heard across the lake.  The clouds have partly
cleared, and the stars can be seen overhead.  Daria sits with her head on Tom's
shoulder, and his arm around her, the blanket is over their shoulders for
warmth.  Light from a flashlight flickers on the windows behind them, but they
are looking away.</i><p><b>TOM:</b> And if you follow the two stars from the
big dipper in a line, you can see the north star, which isn't really at true
north, although it's close, at least for now...<p><b>DARIA:</b> Tom, you're
babbling, relax and enjoy the stars.<p><i>Daria snuggles closer, and turns her
face up to Tom, who leans in for a kiss, as we hear:</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> (off
screen) We can talk out on the balcony, it's private out there.<p><i>Tom and
Daria pull apart and, look at each other in panic.</i><p><b>Cut to:</b> the
honeymoon suite.<p><i>Sandi and Upchuck walk past the bed, and the door to the
hall behind them begins to open.  With a shocked look on her face, Sandi grabs
Upchucks arm and pulls him into the bathroom as she turns off her
flashlight.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> (urgent whisper) Quick, Stacy can't see us
together!<p><i>Kevin and Brittany enter the room, and Kevin sets an oil lamp
down on the bureau by the door.</i><p><b>BRITTANY:</b>  (perky) Ohh, this is
soo romantic Kevvy! <p><b>KEVIN:</b>  Aww, Babe.<p><b>BRITTANY:</b>  But what
if Sandi or Stacy comes back?<p><b>KEVIN:</b> Everyone's downstairs singing
with Mr. O'Neill.  (Beat)  Hey, check out the shape of the
bed!<p><b>BRITTANY:</b>  (passionate) Ohh Kevvy!<p><b>Cut to:</b> The balcony.
Tom and Daria are still sitting behind the Jacuzzi, but we can hear muffled
sounds of smooching coming from the open door.  The two look at each other and
shrug.<p><b>TOM:</b> (whispering) Now what?<p><b>Cut to:</b> The
bathroom.<p><i>Sandi and Upchuck stand by the sink, their faces lit by light
from the oil lamp in the other room, filtering through the louvered door.  To
one side of them are a vanity table and a sink.  On the other is a large,
claw-foot bathtub, with a shower and a curtain hanging from the ceiling around
it.  The curtain is pulled partway around the tub.</i><p><b>UPCHUCK:</b>
(whispering) Now what?<p><b>SANDI:</b>  (whispering) We wait for them to
leave.<p><i>Upchuck goes over, and peers through the louvers of the
door.</i><p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> (whispering) Works for me.<p><i>Sandi looks at him
in disgust. </i><p><b>SANDI:</b> (whispering) Charles!<p><i> He turns to look
back at her, with a sheepish expression, and then moves over to sit on the edge
of the tub, facing her.</i><p><b>Fade out, and back in.</b>  <p><i>Sandi is
leaning on the sink.  Upchuck sits facing her, on the edge of the
tub.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b>  I haven't heard anything for a while.  Do you think
they've left?<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> Either that, or they've fallen asleep.  Shall
we leave, madam?  (he offers her his arm).<p><b>SANDI:</b> Just go! (but she
smiles as he turns to the door)<p><i>Upchuck opens the door, and as he's about
to step out, the hall door in the other room opens.  He quickly jumps back,
leaving the door partly open.</i><p><b>Cut to:</b> The honeymoon suite, as
Quinn and Stacy enter.  <p><i>An oil light flickers on the bureau just inside
the door, throwing long shadows across the room.  Blankets are piled on the
heart-shaped bed, but the whole bed is in shadow.  Stacy holds an oil lamp,
which glows dimly.  The two walk towards the balcony.</i><p><b>BRITTANY:</b>
(off screen, muffled by blankets) Kevvy!  Did you leave the door open?  I'm
cold.<p><b>KEVIN:</b> (off screen, muffled) I'll warm you up, Babe!<p><i>Quinn
and Stacy exchange shocked looks, and Quinn grabs Stacy's arm and pulls her into
the bathroom.</i><p><b>Cut to:</b> the bathroom, as Quinn and Stacy run in. 
<p><i>The bathroom is empty, but the shower curtain now completely surrounds
the tub.  Stacy sets down the oil lamp on a small table, and Quinn runs to the
sink.</i><p><b>Cut to:</b> inside the tub.<p><i>Sandi and Upchuck are sitting
at opposite ends of the tub.  Upchuck looks amused, but Sandi is looking in
terror towards the curtain.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b>  (off-screen, disgusted) Eww! 
I think I'm going to be sick!<p><i>Sandi's look of terror is overlain with
amusement, as she jams her fist against her mouth to keep from making any
sounds.</i><p><b>Interior.  Hallway.</b><p><i>Jodie and Mack walk down the
hall.  Mack holds a flashlight.</i><p><b>JODIE:</b> Thanks Mack.  One more
verse of <i>Puff The Magic Dragon</i> and I'd have broken that guitar over his
head!<p><b>MACK:</b>  We'd better not go to my room, I saw Kevin and Brittany
sneak off earlier, and they're probably still there.<p><b>JODIE:</b>  Let's
check out the honeymoon suite, Stacy said it was really nice.<p><b>MACK:</b>
What if someone's in there?<p><b>JODIE:</b> Then we'll apologize and say we
opened the wrong door in the dark.  Where's your sense of
adventure?<p><b>MACK:</b> (resigned) All right, if it will make you
happy.<p><b>Cut to:</b> the Honeymoon Suite.  Jodie and Mack enter, and look
around.  <p><i>The oil light on the bureau throws a dim light across the room. 
The bed is shadowed, but the half-open door of the bath and the door to the
balcony can be clearly seen.  Mack turns off the flashlight, and the two head
across the room, passing the bed.</i><p><b>BRITTANY:</b> (off screen, muffled)
Eep!  Kevvy!  Watch your hands!<p><b>KEVIN:</b> (off screen, muffled,
entreating) Oh, Babe.  Please?<p><i>Jodie and Mack run for the nearest exit,
the balcony.</i><p><b>Cut to:</b> the balcony.<p><i>Daria and Tom are still
sitting behind the Jacuzzi.  They seem to be suppressing laughter.  They look
over in shocked surprise as Mack and Jodie run out, and dive behind the potted
plants on the other side of the balcony.  Mack and Jodie look up, and see them,
and are also nonplussed.  All four look back at the room, then at each other,
and begin laughing quietly.</i><p><b>BRITTANY:</b> (off screen) That's
enough, Mr. Busy-hands!<p><b>KEVIN:</b> (off screen, pleading) Aww,
babe...<p><b>BRITTANY:</b> (off screen) No.  I won't be a forlorn woman just
because you can't control yourself.<p><b>KEVIN:</b> (off screen) But I've got
protection!<p><b>BRITTANY:</b> (off screen) Football pads aren't the kind you
need!<p><b>KEVIN:</b> (off screen, puzzled) They're not?<p><i>Their voices
trail off, and a door opening and closing is heard.  After a brief moment of
quiet, Jodie and Mack move over to Join Tom and Daria.</i><p><b>JODIE:</b>
Well, what are you two doing out here?<p><b>DARIA:</b> I could ask you the same
question.<p><b>JODIE:</b> (grinning) But I asked first.<p><b>MACK:</b>
(nervous) Could we save the twenty-questions until we get out of
here?<p><b>TOM:</b>  But is it safe to leave?  That room's been pretty busy
tonight.<p><b>JODIE:</b> There were others?<p><b>DARIA:</b> Not quite the
same, but there have been quite a few people wandering through.<p><b>TOM:</b> 
Let's go out two at a time, then if someone else comes in we have a chance of
hiding under the bed or something.<p><b>DARIA:</b> (dry) Oh, that would be a
big improvement over being caught.<p><b>JODIE:</b>  Well, it sounds reasonable.
You guys were here the longest, so you should probably leave
first.<p><b>DARIA:</b> I won't be sorry to see the last of this place.  I was
beginning to wonder if jumping to my death in the lake would be an improvement. 
(to Tom)  Let's go.<p><i>Daria and Tom head for the room
entrance.</i><p><b>Cut to:</b> the bathroom.<p><i>Stacy and Quinn are standing
in the bathroom.  Stacy picks up the lamp.</i><p><b>STACY:</b> They're gone,
c'mon.<p><i>The two open the door and walk into the main room.</i><p><b>Cut
to:</b> main room of the suite.  <p><i>Tom and Daria are halfway across the
room, in the dark, as Stacy and Quinn enter with the oil light.  All four stop,
and look at each other in total surprise.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> Daria!  That was
you?  I thought it was Brittany!  Arrrrgh!  I can't take this!  I need a
shower!<p><i>Quinn runs from the room, Stacy looks at Tom and
Daria.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> (uncertain) Uh, I can explain, but I need to talk to
Quinn before she talks to anyone else.  Excuse us.<p><i>Daria runs for the
door, pulling Tom after her.  Stacy follows at a walk, carrying the
light.</i><p><b>Cut to:</b> the balcony.  <p><i>Mack and Jodie have been
watching the whole scene through the windows.</i><p><b>JODIE:</b> (suppressing
laughter) Oh, she's never going to live this down!  Poor Daria.<p><b>MACK:</b>
(nervous) Well, the same thing could happen to us if we don't get out of here. 
Aren't you worried about your reputation at all?<p><b>JODIE:</b> Why?  My
reputation will survive a few misunderstandings.<p><i>The two sneak quietly
through the room.</i><p><b>Cut to:</b> the tub.<p><i>Sandi and Upchuck are
sitting at opposite ends of the empty tub, with the curtain around them.  Both
look at each other.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b>  And Quinn thinks it was Daria... 
(starts to laugh, and bites down on her knuckles to keep from making any
noise).<p><i>Upchuck is holding his hands over his mouth, his shoulders shaking
with suppressed laughs.  After a while, he looks up.</i><p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> 
(quietly) I haven't heard anyone recently.  I probably better get out of here
before Stacy comes back and sees me with you.<p><i>Sandi calms herself enough
to talk, but she's still very amused by recent events.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b>
(reluctant) Yes, Charles, you'd better go.  We can talk
later.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> Just call me "Chuck", it's the way I prefer
it.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Chuck, eh?  Charles does seem too formal for friends. 
(beat)  Oh, I just can't get over Quinn...<p><i>She starts to shake with
laughter, this time aloud, as Upchuck stands up.  She holds up her hand towards
him.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> (between laughs) Help me up.  (chuckle)  I'm laughing
too hard to get my balance.<p><i>Upchuck gives her a hand, and as she stands
she loses her balance and falls against him.  He steadies her, with an odd look
of affection on his face.</i><p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> Careful.  This is a cast-iron
tub.  If you fell you could hurt yourself.<p><i>Sandi, leaning against Upchuck,
looks down at him with an affectionate smile of her own.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> 
(softly) I don't need to worry with you here.<p><i>She leans forward, and
kisses him on the lips.  The kiss lasts some time, then the two recoil from each
other in surprise.</i><p><b>UPCHUCK:</b>  (panicky) I better go!<p><i>He
flails the curtain aside, and runs off.  Sandi remains standing, with a look of
shock on her face.</i><p><b>Interlude II (a video montage with
music):</b><p><i>Sandi ordering the three J's about, outside the
bus.</i><p><i>Jane sketching mountains, while Daria and Tom look on,
talking.</i><p><i>Sandi and Tiffany reading Waif in the lobby.</i><p><i>Sandi
and Upchuck, sitting in the bathtub, laughing.</i><p><b>Commercial
Break</b>
			<hr>
			<p><b>ACT III</b><p><b>Exterior.  Lodge - Sunday
Morning.</b><p><b>The students are milling about in front of the lodge, Ms.
Barch, Mr. O'Neill and Sandi are standing off to one side talking.  The former
fashion club is in a cluster, accompanied by the three J's.  The three J's
appear to be arguing over who gets to carry Quinn's backpack (a big hiking pack,
unlike the small daypacks most students are wearing).  Upchuck stands off to one
side, watching Daria and Tom covertly.</b><p><b>BARCH:</b>  I'm going to take
the serious hikers up the mountain trail.  Skinny, you handle the nature walk
down by the marsh, and Sandi, you lead the group hiking on the easy
trail.<p><i>Mr. O'Neill and Sandi nod.</i><p><b>BARCH:</b> Remember, you need
to be back here by three to board the bus, and make sure you take a headcount
periodically so you don't lose anyone.<p><i>The three break up, and start
organizing separate groups.</i><p><b>Fade out and back in on Sandi leading a
group along a trail.</b><p><i>The trail has a mild upward slope, and goes
through a wooded area.  The camera watches the group file past.  Quinn, Stacy,
and Tiffany follow Sandi, with the three J's close behind.  Mack and Jodie
follow them, with Daria, Tom, and Jane behind them.  Upchuck brings up the rear
alone.  The camera zooms in on Daria and Tom.</i><p><b>TOM:</b> That Upchuck
fellow is really starting to get on my nerves.  I think I'll go have a talk with
him.<p><i>Daria looks thoughtful.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> No, Tom.  I appreciate
it, but this is my problem to handle. You stick with Jane, and I'll talk to
him.<p><b>TOM:</b> Are you sure?<p><b>DARIA:</b> (abrupt) I managed to cope
with him for two years before I met you, I think I can handle it.<p><i>Tom is a
little put off by her tone.</i><p><b>TOM:</b> Fine, deal with him, I'll talk to
Jane.<p><i>Daria steps to the side of the trail, and waits for Upchuck to walk
up.  When he catches up to her, he stops.</i><p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> Is something
the matter?<p><b>DARIA:</b> We need to talk.<p><i>Upchuck takes a step
backwards.</i><p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> (nervous) I didn't do
anything!<p><b>DARIA:</b> That's not quite true.  You've been very well
behaved, but this constant staring is starting to drive Tom nuts.  And I'm not
exactly thrilled by it either.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> (downbeat) Oh, that obvious,
huh?  Sorry.  I can't seem to do anything right.<p><i>Daria seems surprised by
his response.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> So, what gives?<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> What do
you mean?<p><b>DARIA:</b> There seems to be something other than your usual
pursuit of everything female going on here.  I'm giving you an opportunity to
explain it before I decide to let Tom deal with you.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b>  Oh. 
(beat)  I know you have a boyfriend, but do you think we could be
friends?<p><b>DARIA:</b> That isn't what you really want.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b>
(downbeat) No, but it's the best I could hope to get, isn't
it?<p><i>Daria sighs, and turns to look up the trail.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Come
on, we should walk so we don't get further behind.  (beat)  Look, you seem like
a decent person now.  But I've known you for two years, and that's not the
person I think of when I see you.  I really can't see us being anything more
than casual acquaintances.  We've got nothing in common except that we're
outcasts from the general student population because they see us as "brains". 
Tom and I, or Jane and I for that matter, get along because we share things to
talk about, and a way of looking at the world.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> Yeah.  I think
I'd realized that the other day when I saw you and Tom by the lake.  (beat)  Um,
you're not mad at me, are you?<p><b>DARIA:</b> No, Chuck.  Just cut out the
staring.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> Chuck?<p><b>DARIA:</b>  I told you I'd use your
name if you managed to act like a human.  As long as you can keep acting like
one, you'll be "Chuck".<p><i>Up ahead the trail opens out into a field, and the
students are milling about, taking a rest break.  Sandi appears to be counting
heads, and seems surprised when she sees Daria and Upchuck walking together. 
Daria separates from him, and walks over to Tom and Jane.  Upchuck walks off by
himself.</i><p><b>TOM:</b> So?<p><b>DARIA:</b> Problem solved.<p><b>JANE:</b>
And?  Inquiring minds want to know!<p><b>DARIA:</b>  There's nothing to know. 
I told Chuck to stop it.  He said he would.<p><b>JANE:</b>
Chuck?<p><b>DARIA:</b>  As long as he behaves himself, he's Chuck.<p><i>Jane
shakes her head, and decides it's time to do some drawing.  Daria looks off at
the crowd, and notices Sandi staring over at Upchuck.</i><p><b>Cut to:</b>
Sandi.<p><i>Sandi is standing, looking over at Upchuck with a pensive look, as
the other three girls walk up.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> Are we going to be stopped
here long?  The wind is really blowing my hair around.<p><b>SANDI:</b>
(distracted) That's good.<p><b>QUINN:</b> What?<p><i>Sandi starts, and
realizes she said something wrong.  She turns to Quinn.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b>
Sorry Quinn, I was thinking about the hike.  What did you say?<p><b>QUINN:</b>
(still irritated) Gee, Sandi, I didn't know it took a lot of effort to think
about walking.<p><i>Sandi's eyes narrow as she looks at
Quinn.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> (haughty) Quinn, honey, don't start.  I may not be a
brain on history tests, but I can out-bitch you any day of the week.<p><i>Stacy
and Tiffany walk up, with the three J's following.</i><p><b>STACY:</b> (worried
tone) You two aren't fighting, are you?  I thought we were through with
that.<p><i>Sandi looks at Quinn, and lifts her eyebrows in a silent
query.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> No, Stacy, that's just the way Sandi and I
talk.<p><b>STACY:</b> Oh, the same way your sister is never serious about
anything.<p><i>Sandi looks surprised by this comparison, but not as surprised
as Quinn.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> I'm not like her at all!<p><i>Stacy
flinches.</i><p><b>STACY:</b> Okay Quinn, don't go postal, huh?  (to Sandi) So,
when are we going to start moving again?<p><b>SANDI:</b> We'll just give people
a couple more minutes.  We're just getting started, and I don't want anyone
getting too tired to keep up later.<p><b>Fade out and back in.</b><p><i>The
sun is high in the sky; it's probably close to noon.  The group is moving down
an open hillside, more spread out than earlier.  At the bottom, the trail
crosses a narrow wooden footbridge over a small ravine.  Beyond, the trail goes
up over a ridge. Sandi and the three girls are out in front.  The three J's have
fallen a ways behind, and seem to be getting tired.  Upchuck follows them at a
safe distance, and Jodie, Mack, Daria, Tom, and Jane have not yet come out of
the woods at the top of the hill.</i><p><b>Cut to:</b> Sandi, crossing the
bridge.<p><i>The bridge is only wide enough for one person.  Sandi leads the
three girls over.</i><p><b>STACY:</b> What a cute little stream down
there!<p><i>The girls stop, and look down.  A small, but fast, mountain stream
flows through the bottom of the ravine, about twenty feet below the
bridge.</i><p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Yeah, I wish I'd brought a
camera.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Come on, we should be getting close to the outlook. 
There's supposed to by a couple of picnic tables there we can use for lunch. 
Let's not spend too much time here.<p><i>The group begins to move.  As they
exit the bridge, Sandi looks back at the group, just in time to see Mack, Jodie,
Daria, Tom, and Jane exit the woods.  They've fallen quite far behind.  Jane
pulls out her sketchbook and the others stop to talk while she draws.  Sandi
turns to look at Upchuck.</i><p><b>Cut to:</b> The three J's, approaching the
bridge.<p><b>JOEY:</b> Oh man, I'm bushed.  What does Quinn have in this pack
anyway?<p><b>JAMIE:</b> Probably something useless.  She hasn't paid any
attention to us all day, so it can't be too important.<p><b>JEFFY:</b> Hey,
Sandi's looking back at us.  Maybe Quinn wants something.<p><i>Joey looks at
Sandi, and then back behind him.</i><p><b>JOEY:</b> No way, she's looking at
Upchuck.<p><b>JEFFY:</b> Why would she be looking at Upchuck?<p><b>JOEY:</b>
Maybe he's been bugging Quinn.<p><b>JEFFY:</b> How?  He's back there, and Sandi
doesn't care about Quinn anyway.<p><b>JAMIE:</b> Hey, if we did something about
Upchuck, maybe Quinn would pay more attention to us.<p><b>JOEY:</b> Yeah, we
could tell him to go back and join the other brains, and not follow us so
close.<p><b>JEFFY:</b> Yeah, but lets wait 'till he's on the bridge, then he
has to listen to us.<p><b>JAMIE:</b> Good idea.<p><i>The three walk out onto
the bridge.  Upchuck follows, about fifteen feet back.  When they reach the far
end, they stop, and turn back towards him.  Upchuck doesn't notice at first,
because he's carefully looking at where he places his feet, and holding the
railing on both sides of the bridge.  He's clearly unnerved by being on the
bridge.</i><p><b>JOEY:</b> Hold it.  Stop following us.<p><i>Upchuck,
startled, stops and looks up.</i><p><b>UPCHUCK:</b>  Huh?  We're on a bridge,
where do you expect me to go?<p><b>JOEY:</b> Go back and hang out with the
other brains.  We don't want you bothering Quinn.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> (annoyed,
and still nervous about the bridge) I'm not bothering Quinn.  Get out of my
way.<p><i>Joey walks up and shoves him.</i><p><b>JOEY:</b> I said, go
back!<p><i>Upchuck, with a panicked look in his eyes, stumbles backwards, and
grabs one of the rails with both hands.</i><p><b>Cut to:</b> Sandi.<p><i>Sandi
still looking backwards from about halfway up to the ridge, sees Joey and
Upchuck on the bridge.  She stops with a gasp of shock.  The other girls look at
her, then look backwards.</i><p><b>STACY:</b> What are you looking at
Sandi?<p><b>SANDI:</b> (distracted) What are those boys doing?<p><b>QUINN:</b>
Looks like they're fighting with Upchuck.  So?<p><b>SANDI:</b> So?  Someone
could get hurt.  A bridge is no place for fighting.<p><b>QUINN:</b> They won't
hurt him, Sandi.  Besides, Mack will put a stop to it when he gets to the
bridge.  Why do you care?  It's Upchuck.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Why?  (thinks) 
Because I'm the trail guide.  I'm responsible.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> But it's just
a small bridge, and he's near the edge.  Even if fell he probably wouldn't be
hurt.<p><b>SANDI:</b> (decisive) No, I can't let this go on.  Chuck's afraid of
heights; he must be terrified.<p><i>Sandy heads towards the bridge at a run. 
Quinn turns to Stacy.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> Did she just call him
"Chuck"?<p><b>TIFFANY:</b>  That is sooo wrong.<p><i>Stacy doesn't say
anything, but she watches Sandi with a thoughtful look.</i><p><b>Cut to:</b>
the bridge.<p><i>Joey is still pushing Upchuck, while Jeffy and Jamie stand
just off the bridge and laugh.  Sandi comes running up.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> 
Joey, stop that!  What kind of an idiot are you, fighting on a
bridge?<p><i>Joey turns to her, surprised.</i><p><b>JOEY:</b>  Sandi!  We
weren't fighting, we were just fooling around.  Right Upchuck?<p><i>Upchuck
clings to the rail, far too terrified to speak.  In the distance, Tom and Mack
can be seen running towards the bridge.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> The three of you
should be ashamed of yourselves!  Get moving, and if I have any more trouble out
of you, you'll be hearing from Ms. Barch when we get back.<p><b>JOEY:</b> (a
little worried) Honest, we were just fooling around.<p><b>SANDI:</b>  Just go. 
Now.<p><i>The three boys turn, and head towards Quinn and Tiffany.  Sandi turns
to Upchuck.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b>  Chuck, are you okay?  They're gone, and it's
just a couple of steps to the end of the bridge.<p><i>Tom and Mack run up, as
Upchuck looks up at Sandi.</i><p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> (quavering voice)  Th...
Thanks, Sandi.  Just give me a moment.<p><b>TOM:</b> (to Upchuck) Are you okay?
What were those idiots doing?<p><b>SANDI:</b> (bitter) Being idiots. (normal
voice)  Can you help Chuck?  I need to get back up front.<p><b>TOM:</b> Yeah.
(to Upchuck) Here, lean on me.<p><b>MACK:</b>  And I can go beat some sense
into them.  Being team captain has some perks.<p><i>Upchuck leans on Tom, and
begins to walk.</i><p><b>MACK:</b> (off screen) You three are a disgrace to the
football team!<p><b>JOEY:</b> (off screen) Hey, we weren't doing
anything!<p><b>MACK:</b> (off screen) Don't give me that!  All three of you,
drop and give me twenty!<p><b>ALL THREE:</b> (off screen) What?<p><b>MACK:</b>
(off screen) I mean it!  Now!  Or do you want me to get really creative at the
next training session?<p><b>ALL THREE:</b> (off screen) Aww,
man.<p><b>Exterior. Scenic Outlook - Lunchtime.</b><p><i>The group is sitting
around three picnic tables, eating sandwiches.  Sandi sits with the other three
girls, while the three J's have a table to themselves, now they look even more
tired than before.  Everyone else sits at the third table.</i><p><b>STACY:</b>
(teasing voice) How's "Chuck"?<p><b>SANDI:</b> (surprised at the question) How
should I know?  I haven't been walking with him.<p><b>STACY:</b> Well, you knew
he was afraid of heights.<p><i>Sandi looks uncertain.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> 
Umm, that's just because I'm the guide.  Mr. O'Neill told
me.<p><b>STACY:</b>  (teasing voice) Are you sure that's all it
is?<p><b>QUINN:</b> Eww, Stacy!  Don't even joke about something like
that.<p><b>Cut to:</b> Upchuck.<p><b>SANDI:</b> (off screen, haughty) Stacy, I
don't know what you mean.  I would never have anything to do with... (she
stumbles briefly over the name)  ...with Upchuck.  You should know me better
than that.<p><i>Upchuck, who wasn't looking all that happy to begin with, looks
stricken when he overhears her use his nickname.</i><p><b>Cut to:</b>
Sandi.<p><i>Sandi sees Upchucks reaction, and looks sad herself, but doesn't
say anything.</i><p><b>Fade out and back in.</b><p><b>The hikers are
staggering down the final leg of the trail.  In the distance can be seen the
Lodge, with a school bus parked in front of it.  People are milling about near
the bus, not quite ready to depart.  Sandi and her friends lead, with the main
group behind them, and the three J's, obviously exhausted, trailing.  Upchuck
walks slightly ahead of the main group, well behind Sandi and her
friends.</b><p><i>Upchuck walks with a distracted air, not really paying
attention to his surroundings.  He occasionally stumbles over roots, or rocks. 
The impression is of someone deep in thought.  Mack comes forward to walk with
him.</i><p><b>MACK:</b>  Charles, are you sure you don't want me to tell Ms.
Barch about the bridge?  Those three deserve to catch some
hell.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> I'm sure.  Besides, I think you gave them enough hell
already.  Thanks.<p><b>MACK:</b> No problem.  (beat)  Jodie told me you'd been
acting civil to the girls the last few weeks.  One good turn deserves
another.<p><b>Interior.  Lawndale High School Hallway -
Monday.</b><p><i>Sandi, Quinn, Stacy and Tiffany are walking down the hallway
together.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> I'm glad that's over with.  My legs are still
sore from all that walking.<p><b>STACY:</b> Well, it wasn't that bad, but I'll
be glad to have a couple of days to rest before the sale.  Won't you,
Sandi?<p><b>SANDI:</b> I'm just happy I'm done with leading hikes.  I paid off
Ms. Li, and she even let me keep a little money because Ms. Barch said I did
such a good job.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Wow, Ms. Barch said that?  (beat)  So, what
are you going to spend the money on?<p><b>SANDI:</b> Well, I was thinking of
taking the three of you out for no-cheese pizza after we go shopping, if you're
interested.<p><b>STACY:</b> Gee, Sandi, you're a real friend.<p><b>QUINN and
TIFFANY:</b> Yeah!<p><i>As they say this, Sandi notices Upchuck standing by his
locker up ahead.  Sandi gets a thoughtful look.</i><p><b>Begin flashback
montage.</b><p><b>The following are similar to earlier scenes, but they are
seen from Sandi's viewpoint this time.</b><p><i>Chuck, sitting with her, while
she feeds the birds in the park.</i><p><i>Chuck, watching children play in the
park.</i><p><i>Chuck in the bathroom of the honeymoon suite, turning away from
the door and sitting on the tub after Sandi told him to behave.</i><p><i>Chuck,
looking terrified on the bridge.</i><p><i>Chuck, looking sad at the scenic
outlook.</i><p><b>End flashback sequence.</b><p><b>SANDI:</b> (thoughtful)
Yeah, a real friend.  (businesslike)  Excuse me, I need to talk to
someone.<p><i>Sandi walks quickly up to Upchuck.  The other three can be seen
watching in the background with various looks of surprise.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b>
Chuck, I wanted to apologize for what I said yesterday.  I wasn't
thinking.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> (looking over at the other three, worried) Sandi,
your friends can see us.<p><b>SANDI:</b> (confident) If they're really my
friends, they'll get used to it.  (diffident)  Um, I was wondering, could I take
you to Chez Pierre tonight? To say thanks for all the help you've given me this
fall.<p><i>Upchuck seems stunned, in the background Quinn seems to have
overheard Sandi, and is equally stunned.</i><p><b>UPCHUCK:</b>  S.. Sure.  If
you really want to.<p><b>SANDI:</b> I want to.  Pick me up at seven,
okay?<p><b>Cut to:</b> The other three girls.<p><i>Quinn holds her hands to
the sides of her face, with her mouth open in a soundless scream (think of the
painting, The Scream, by Edvard Munch, the one with the wavy purple
figure).</i><p><b>TIFFANY:</b> This is soo weird.<p><i>Stacy has an approving
expression on her face.</i><p><b>STACY:</b>  I don't know, I think it's
sweet.

			<p><i>Authors Notes:</i><p>The germ of this story came when
I decided to see if I could write a bedroom farce without making it a sex comedy
(that idea, in turn, came from the opening scene of A Shot in the Dark, the
second Peter Sellers Pink Panther movie).  That, coupled with a desire to
explore the effects of losing her position as club president on Sandi, led me to
decide to write a romantic comedy, with Upchuck as the not-so-innocent victim. 
Two misfits, thrown together by fate, both with plans that don't involve the
other, catalyzing change in each other, is the stuff of which such comedies are
made.<p>What happened to the Fashion Club, and why would Daria know anything
about computer networks?  I told you to read <i>Breaking Strain</i> first,
didn't I?<p>The title - I chose this title because of the original meaning of
the quote, people who wouldn't normally associate with each other are sometimes
thrown together by circumstance.  That it also helps to confuse things, but
implying something else, didn't hurt either.<p>Upchuck and Daria - See
Upchuck's Gallery of Feisty Babes in the <i>Daria Diaries</i> (Pocket Books,
1998) for confirmation (or at least a strong suggestion) that he holds a special
place in his heart for Daria.<p>Linda Griffin - If Sandi's problem is
insecurity, rather than a simple hunger for power, as I suggested in <i>Breaking
Strain</i>, then something has to be the cause.  I'm presuming it's Linda,
trying to succeed through her daughter, where her own life has been less
rewarding than she'd like.  The comment about "ex-news anchor" comes from the
Family Portraits entry in the <i>Daria Database</i> (Pocket Books, 1998), where
it's noted that Linda tends to dwell on her brief career as a news anchor,
twenty years ago.  Linda's idea of motivation here verges on child abuse. 
Unfortunately, I've met parents like that.  Fortunately, neither of mine is
among them.<p>Sandi - It's difficult to be true to Sandi's inherently
self-centered character and still make her a sympathetic protagonist.  I've
tried to do that by showing that she's aware of her behavior, and regrets it
even as she continues to behave that way.  I've also tried to show some gradual
change in her character over the course of several weeks as a result of the loss
of the club and her realization that it was ultimately her fault.  I'd be
interested in feedback on how true to Sandi this story felt.<p><b>THE
END</b><p></div>
