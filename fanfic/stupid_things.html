<P>Jane&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about her plans
to dominate the world?

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waited too long, had
to fall back on her yes man.

<P>Jane&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's done.

<P>There's a knock on the door

<P>Jake&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (cuts her) I'm sure he'll
be fine. I remember when he stayed here, he's a fine boy, he reminds me
when i was his age.

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did you come here?

<P>Jake&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just wanted to warn

<P>Helen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Common I want some smiles

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never smile without
a good reason

father's car. I had to get to my knees to have it.

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please lemme drive it!

<P>Tom&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No way! you're too rude
on cars man!

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If i remember my car
dosen't holds itself with steel wire.

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What they would do for
cars. (she looks at Jane, she's drooling over the car) Nevermind

<P>Tom&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure

<P>They leave.

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometime they make me
sick

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, me too

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Common you can have
any girl you want.

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know but i'm tired
of of dating just to have sex.

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why?

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd like to do something
else than making out with my girlfriends. It's frustrating, you try to
talk to them but all they see in you is a talking vibrator. i'm not like
that you know it.

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know

<P>Cut to the FC. They're at the drink table without their dates. There
is a ice sculpture on the table.

<P>Sandi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can she dare to
wear the same dress as I?

<P>Tiffany&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's soooo bad.

<P>Sandi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dunno she looks different
than you in that (Sandi glares at her) Maybe not.

<P>Quinn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't worry, you look
better than her and she's just a looser. let her be no one'll notice.

<P>Sandi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did. That's enough.
I'll make so no one else will.

<P>She grabs the ice sculpture

<P>Cut to Trent &amp; Daria

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know you look really
good in that?

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (blushes)You're saying
that just to be kind with me

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No. Really. I just never
noticed that you were that beautiful

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (blushes harder) Thanks

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know i think i'm
in love

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (dejectedly) And who
is the lucky girl?

<P>(O/S SFX: Smash)

<P>They turn to see from where it comes. Jane is laying down uncouncious.
Sandi is still holds the ice sculpture. Tom looks schocked.(Wrath Within
- Children of Bodom)

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What the fuck?

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane?

<P>They run to her side Tom holds Trent back before he decks Sandi. Daria
gets up and faces Sandi

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What the hell was that
for?

<P>Sandi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (looks like Jack Nicholson
in the Shining, but worse) Cause she's got the same goddam dress than you?
I always tought you were a little fucked up but that goes far beyond what
i tought

<P>Sandi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Faux-cool) The bitch
had just to choose an other one.

<P>Daria looks at her a moment then punches her in te face. Sandi falls
down and Daria starts to kick her with her boots. De Martino comes to restrain
her but she pushes him away and continues to kick at the girl. De Martino
and Coach Gibson succes at restraining her

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Yelling at the top
of her lungs) Next time you call her bitch i'll kill you i swear it on
my boots understood you goddam fuckin slut?

<P>Trent takes her by the soulders

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Whispering) calm down
Daria, she's not worthy.

<P>Later at the Hospital, Waiting room (One - Metallica)

<P>Tom&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did that girl hat
to snap like that?

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Still enraged) cause
she just a goddam brainless fashion nazi

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (senses Daria's wrath)
Uh Tom i think you should get the Stang back.

<P>Tom&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Picks up) I should

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (tosses his keys to
Tom) Here take my car, I would not ride in your wheeled junkmobile

<P>Tom&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok. Anyway I would not
have a ride in it. I'd slam the gas too hard and blow the carburetor. Later

<P>Trent &amp; Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later

<P>Trent takes Daria's hand.

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are you so upset.

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why? Cause my only friend
lies in a freaking hospital bed and I cannot do anything about it.

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You could't have done
anything. You can't watch every noe she does.

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that but i still
feel guilty

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You don't have to. It
was a stupid accident. Sad, but it happened. You know if Tom hadn't been
there I would have kicket that girls ass to. You know how i feel about
Janey. She sure can be a pain in the ass sometimes but she's still my sister.
I'm glad to have her in my life. our other siblings never really cared
for us. And the 'rents are never home anymore. She's the only family member
I really relate to.

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know. She's the one
of the few who I really care of, her and you, and Tom in a certain way.

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wanna come outside I
have to take some air, that place creeps me out.

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok.

<P>Ouside

<P>Trent lights a cigarette

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since when d'you smoke?

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I only smoke in stressful
moments,and this is one. Want one

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't smoke (bt) what
the hell if it can calm me

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here

<P>She lights up

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know i'm glad you
came into Janey's life. She was pretty lonely. Before she used to hang
with us. I don't think that's so good.

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're not that bad.
And the guys are kinda funny. even if they can be dumb sometimes.

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah I know, but i think
sometimes I have a bad influence on her.

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nah, you're a really
nice person. A little Lazy maybe but nice. You're wise and you have the
guts to hold on your ethics.

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You really think that?

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes. I think you're
the kind of man every sensed woman would like to have in her live.

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know i really like
you? I like the way you can make me think, your wicked sense of humor and
all that. And I love that smile of yours.

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Blushing) don't say
things you don't mean

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read my lips, you're
the coolest girl I know. You know when i said you were beautiful, i really
meant it.

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Blushing harder) Trent...

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Cups her face with
his hand) You know that girl I said I was in love with?

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Feeling her heart sinking
in her chest) yeah

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm holding her beautiful
face right now

<P>He kisses her lightly on the lips. She blushes beet red

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love you Daria, and
I mean it.

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (hesitates a little)
Me too, I love you Trent.

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's cold here wanna

room.

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (whispering)Well I think
i'll sleep on the couch.

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Hugs her, whispering
too) You don't have to. I'll behave. Sweared.

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know you will. I know
I won't.

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that case, you can
sleep in my bed

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dunno

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (smiles at her) You
don't have to be afraid. I won't pressure you to anything.

<P>Daria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Looks in his eyes)Aw

<P>Trent is spooning Daria's body. He wakes up. Looks at her and smiles.

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God she looks like an
angel.

<P>He gets up, puts a pair of boxers (there little guitars printed on them)
and a T shirt on and gets downstairs.

<P>He starts brewing some coffee and making breakfast. He turns the radio
on (American Jesus - Bad Religion)

<P>Tom&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Daria Ok? She seemed
pretty upset last night.

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every one was.

<P>Tom&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean i've seen her when
she's cold with someone, but I never tought she could be angry like that.

<P>Trent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know, she tends to
hide her feelings a lot. Don't worry she's fine.

<P>Tom&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope that girl isn't to
