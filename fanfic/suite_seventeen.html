<p>
[<strong>Scene:</strong> The office of Lawndale High School Psychologist
Margaret Manson.  She and Daria are seated at the interview table]</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> ... and they're cruel.  They make me sleep
in a padded cell.</p><p>
<strong>Mrs. Manson:</strong> [with forced calmness] Now, Daria, you know
very well that one of the reasons you were sent to see me was your
tendency to tell ... er ... tall tales.</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Oh, and there are bars on the windows!</p><p>
[Mrs. Manson looks annoyed.  Daria looks pleased with herself]

[<strong>Scene:</strong> Quinn Morgendorffer's bedroom.
Quinn is lying on her bed reading a magazine]</p><p>
<strong>Quinn:</strong> [to herself] "Do you have a great room?" ...
Yes!</p><p>
[She squints at the page]</p><p>
<strong>Quinn:</strong> Why do they have to make the writing so
small? </p><p>
[She moves her face closer to the magazine]</p><p>
<strong>Quinn:</strong> "We'd like to see photos of it,
and maybe feature it in <em>Seventeen</em>.
Send pics to ..."  [squints harder] Oh, it's no good!</p><p>
[She gives up reading in disgust and turns to look at her bedside
table]</p><p>
[Zoom in to close up of <a href="#glasses">reading glasses</a>

hand reaches for them]</p><p>

glasses]</p><p>
<strong>Quinn:</strong> Blech!</p><p>

<p>
[<strong>Scene:</strong> Daria's bedroom.  Daria is lying on her
bed reading a book]</p><p>
[There's a tentative knock on the door]</p><p>
<strong>Quinn:</strong> Uh, Daria?</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Not interested!</p><p>
[Quinn enters]</p><p>
<strong>Quinn:</strong> I was kind of wondering ...</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> [interrupting] Don't wanna hear it!</p><p>
<strong>Quinn:</strong> [quickly] I just want to borrow your
<a href="#camera">camera</a>.</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> [suspiciously] Why?</p><p>
[Quinn hands Daria the magazine, folded open at the relevant page]</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> [reading aloud] "Your Room."</p><p>
[Daria gives Quinn a withering look.  Quinn smiles nervously]</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> "Send pics to <em>Seventeen</em>,
850 Third Avenue, New York.  Sorry, pics will not be returned."
Well at least there's something to be grateful for!</p><p>
[Daria stares at Quinn with annoyance.  Quinn's nervous smile becomes
a nervous giggle]
</p>

<p>
[<strong>Scene:</strong> Jane Lane's bedroom.  Daria is lying on Jane's
bed with an open book on her lap.  Jane is painting intently]</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> ... and then she gets <em>my</em> camera
and wastes <em>my</em> film taking pictures of the crap in her
room while going on about how famous she's gonna be!</p><p>
<strong>Jane:</strong> [distracted] Well, it would be a feather
in her highly-fashionable chapeau if she got an article published in
a magazine ... before you do.</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> [angry] Hey, it's not like she's
<em>writing</em> anything!</p><p>
<strong>Jane:</strong> [realizing her faux pas]
Oh, right!  And anyway, it's not fair.  It's not like <em>your</em>
room would stand a chance.</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> [even angrier]
<a href="#angermanagement">What's that supposed to mean!?</a>
I thought you liked my room?</p><p>
<strong>Jane:</strong> I do!  Sheesh!  I just meant that your room isn't
the sort that would normally appeal to a teen mag!</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> [muttering loudly] It's not my fault my
room belonged to a mad woman.</p><p>
<strong>Jane:</strong> [under her breath] And it doesn't now?</p><p>
[Daria looks furious.  They return to their respective hobbies in
silence]
</p>

<p>
[<strong>Scene:</strong> Daria's bedroom.  Daria is pacing up and
down]</p><p>
[She stops, evidently having reached a decision.  She goes over to
the chest of drawers near her bed.  The camera is
sitting on top, next
to her wedge-of-cheese model.  She presses the timer button]</p><p>
[<strong>Scene:</strong> The camera's perspective.  Daria walks
back to the middle of her room, and stands facing the camera,
feet apart, arms crossed (the classic "Daria" pose)]</p><p>
[There's a flash and we see the <a href="#photo">image of Daria
standing in her
room</a> framed like a photograph, as it will later appear in
<em>Seventeen</em> magazine]
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
[<strong>Scene:</strong> Margaret Manson's office.
She and Daria are seated]</p><p>
<strong>Mrs. Manson:</strong> Now, Daria, have you had a chance to
think over that story you told me about your bedroom?</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> [apologetically] Yes, ...</p><p>
[Mrs. Manson looks pleased that progress is being made]</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> [suddenly brightening] ... and I realized
that I forgot
to tell you there are human bones all over the floor!</p><p>
[Mrs. Manson looks angry.  Daria gives a Mona Lisa smile]
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
[<strong>Scene:</strong> The Morgendorffer's kitchen.  Daria, Helen and
Jake are eating.  Quinn enters, carrying an envelope]</p><p>
<strong>Quinn:</strong> Look everyone, I've got the pictures of my
room for the magazine.</p><p>
<strong>Helen:</strong> That's nice, dear.</p><p>
[Quinn sits and starts sorting through the photos]</p><p>
<strong>Quinn:</strong> This one shows how well coordinated my
wardrobe is, but this one gives a better view of the gifts from my
many admirers, while this one ... Urk!</p><p>
[Quinn holds up a photo between two fingers]</p><p>
<strong>Quinn:</strong> How did <em>this</em> get in here?</p><p>
[Daria snatches the photo from Quinn's hand]</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Surprise!  I'm submitting a
picture of my room too.</p><p>
<strong>Jake:</strong> Good for you, kiddo!</p><p>
<strong>Quinn:</strong> Mu-ohm!  Tell Daria that she's not allowed
to send in a picture of her horrible room!</p><p>
<strong>Helen:</strong> Now, Quinn, don't begrudge your sister an
opportunity to express herself.</p><p>
[Helen looks closely at the photo, lying on the table]</p><p>
<strong>Helen:</strong> [to Daria] Although it would have been nicer if
you'd let me redecorate before you took the photo.</p><p>
<strong>Quinn:</strong> Yeah!  I mean, why does she have to have a
room like that anyway?</p><p>
<strong>Helen:</strong>  Now, sweetie, you know it's not your sister's
fault.  Her room used to belong to a very disturbed woman.</p><p>
<strong>Quinn:</strong> Like it doesn't now!?</p><p>
<strong>Helen:</strong> [admonishing] Quinn!</p><p>

<p>
[<strong>Scene:</strong> Margaret Manson's office]</p><p>
[Daria and Mrs. Manson are seated, facing each other across
the table, leaning forward.  Mrs. Manson is frowning,
Daria is expressionless.  They are evidently locked in a
battle of wills]</p><p>
[Several seconds pass in tense silence before Daria
abruptly speaks up]</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> There's a television, but it's
bolted to the ceiling, out of my reach.</p><p>
<strong>Mrs. Manson:</strong> [threateningly] Daria!</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> And the <a href="#remote">remote is
missing</a>!</p><p>
[Mrs. Manson slumps back in her chair with a groan]
</p>

<p>
[<strong>Scene:</strong> The Morgendorffer's living room.
Helen is sitting alone on the couch reading some briefs]</p><p>
[The phone rings]</p><p>
<strong>Helen:</strong> Hellooo ... Yes, but she's not in
right now ... Uh, huh ... Oh, that's wonderful ...
Uh,huh ... Yes, we'll see you then.  Goodbye.</p><p>
[Daria enters the room just as Helen is hanging up]</p><p>
<strong>Helen:</strong> Daria, there was a call for you from
a <a href="#sara">Sara</a> at <em>Seventeen</em> magazine.
She says they want to do a feature on your bedroom!  Isn't
that thrilling!?</p><p>
[Daria remains expressionless and silent]</p><p>
<strong>Helen:</strong> And she said that she's going to
come out here to see you in person on Saturday!</p><p>
[An expectant pause.  Daria still says nothing]</p><p>
<strong>Helen:</strong> Hmm ... And we've got just enough time to
do some emergency redecorating before she gets here.</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> [wide-eyed with horror] NO!</p><p>
[Helen smirks knowingly]
</p>

<p>
[<strong>Scene:</strong> Jane's bedroom.  Daria and Jane are
sitting on the edge of the bed watching television]</p><p>
<strong>SSW announcer:</strong> Cheapskate executives saving
rent by sleeping in their offices! It's boardroom and board, tonight
on <em>Sick, Sad World</em>!</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> So I managed to steal Quinn's thunder, but
now I'm forced to spend the day with a hack from a fashion mag.</p><p>
<strong>Jane:</strong> Hey, didn't you tell me that <em>you</em> used to
be a <a href="#fashionreporter">fashion reporter</a>?
You can compare notes!</p><p>
[Daria gives Jane a sour look]
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
[<strong>Sound effect:</strong> Doorbell.  <strong>Scene:</strong>  The
Morgendorffer's front door.  Daria is opening it to admit Sara.  Sara
is twenty-something, blonde, attractive, dressed simply]</p><p>
<strong>Sara:</strong> [brightly]
Daria!  I recognize you from your photo!</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> [unenthusiastically] Hi.
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
[<strong>Scene:</strong> The Morgendorffer's upstairs hallway.  Daria and
Sara are walking towards Daria's room]</p><p>
<strong>Sara:</strong> ... and we don't usually interview people for
"Your Room" in person, but when I saw the picture of <em>your</em>
room I just had to see it for myself!</p><p>
[They pass Quinn's bedroom.  Quinn can be seen through the
doorway posing cutely on her
bed, surrounded by her stuffed animals.  Daria and Sara ignore
her]</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> [glumly] Here it is.</p><p>
[Ominous music plays as the door to Daria's room creaks open.  The
scene pans rapidly past the various creepy items in Daria's room,
skull and bones on the floor, sawn-off bars on the windows, heart
model, etc, before alighting on Daria and Sara standing
in the doorway]</p><p>
<strong>Sara:</strong> [impressed rather than scared] Wow!
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
[<strong>Scene:</strong> Inside Daria's bedroom.  Sara is walking around
with a notepad examining Daria's artifacts]</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> You like it?</p><p>
<strong>Sara:</strong> Sure!  We get pictures of rooms like your
sister's all the time.  This is something special!</p><p>
[Daria looks more relaxed]</p><p>
<strong>Sara:</strong> [looking at Daria's Kafka poster]
<em>Metamorphosis</em>, right?</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> [impressed]
You know that?  I mean, yeah, the guy's a hero.
Who doesn't love giant cockroaches?</p><p>
[Sara steps over Daria's bone collection]</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> [more cooperative]
Those are just there to remind me not to
get too caught up in dieting.</p><p>
<strong>Sara:</strong> [pointing to Daria's chemistry set with her pencil]
And this?</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> I've been studying some of Quinn's brain cells,
to see if they were ever alive.</p><p>
[Sara gives Daria a skeptical look]</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> And it's useful for developing biological
weapons!</p><p>
<strong>Sara:</strong> Uh, huh. [staring at Daria's
partially-unearthed skeleton poster] You have a lot of bones around
the place.</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong>  Hey, I just want something cheerful to wake
up to.</p><p>
[Eyebrows raised, Sara makes rapid notes]
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
[<strong>Scene:</strong> The Morgendorffer's upstairs hallway.  Daria and
Sara are walking away from Daria's room]</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> [now quite talkative] Of course, the
padding prevents eavesdroppers, and protects
me when Quinn's actions force me to bang my head against the wall.</p><p>
[They pass Quinn's room.  Quinn is still posing desperately.
They ignore her again]</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Of course,
I'd spend more time in my room if it wasn't for
those truancy laws.
My friend, Jane, thinks it's cool and Quinn is too scared to set
foot in there, which is nice.</p><p>
[Sara nods and keeps making notes]</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Anyway, I'm planning to get more space ...
once I get my family to move out!
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
[<strong>Scene:</strong> The Morgendorffer's front door.  Daria is
showing Sara out]</p><p>
<strong>Sara:</strong> Well, goodbye Daria.  It's been fun.</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> [surprised to admit it]  Um, yeah.
It was!</p><p>
[As Sara turns to go Daria speaks up]</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Um, I was wondering ...</p><p>
<strong>Sara:</strong> Yes?</p><p>
[Daria looks down at the notebook in Sara's hand]</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> [embarrassed to be serious for a change]
Er, what's it like to be ... an author?</p><p>
<strong>Sara:</strong> [smiling] Well, writing magazine articles
isn't exactly high art, but it has its advantages.</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Such as?</p><p>
<strong>Sara:</strong> Such as getting to meet interesting people.
Like you, Daria!</p><p>
[Daria blushes as Sara walks out the door]</p><p>
[Daria gets her notebook - which looks exactly like Sara's - out
of her jacket pocket and starts writing]

<p>
[<strong>Scene:</strong> Outside Lacklustre Video.  Daria and Jane are
walking towards the pizza place]</p><p>
<strong>Jane:</strong> So the evil purveyor of vapid propaganda from
soulless cosmetics conglomerates wasn't so bad after all?</p><p>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Actually she was kind of cool.  She even sent
me some tips on how get freelance articles published.</p><p>
[They enter the pizza place, where everyone is conspicuously
reading the latest issue of <em>Seventeen</em>.  They walk past
Kevin and Brittany]</p><p>
<strong>Brittany:</strong> Wow, Kevvy!  It says here that Daria's
bedroom used to belong to a crazy lady.</p><p>
<strong>Kevin:</strong> Soooo, ... you're saying it doesn't now?</p><p>

Quinn's reading glasses are mentioned in <em>The Daria Diaries</em>
and are visible on her bedside table in many <em>Daria</em>
episodes.  It seems her vanity keeps her from ever wearing them.
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="camera">
For the purposes of the story above we have assumed that Daria owns
a still camera.  In fact, although it is
known that Daria has an interest in photography, there is no evidence
that she has her own camera.  In the <em>Beavis and
Butt-head</em> episode <em>Sporting Goods</em> it is clear
that the
camera Daria is using belongs to the Highland High School newspaper.
In the <em>Daria</em> episode <em>The New Kid</em> the camera she
uses probably belongs to Lawndale High School's yearbook committee.
In <em>The Teachings of Don Jake</em> she tells Quinn to "get
<em>the</em> camera," obviously referring to the family's camera,
rather than saying, "get <em>my</em> camera."

<a name="dariaspad">
The article in question was titled <em>Daria's Pad</em> and appeared in
the July 1998 issue of <em>Seventeen</em>, page&nbsp;72.  It
featured in the <em>Your Room</em> department, which publishes
pictures and stories about readers' bedrooms.  The article
is interesting for three reasons.  Firstly, it's funny.
Secondly, it contains
a superb picture of Daria standing in her bedroom.  Thirdly, and
most importantly, the article is
written entirely within the context of the televised <em>Daria</em>
universe.  There is nothing in the article (except for
a brief nod to MTV) to suggest that Daria is
not a real girl, living in the real town of Lawndale.  Maintaining
this illusion makes the
article especially enjoyable (and is in contrast to most other published
<em>Daria</em> articles which are either about the television program
itself, or portray Daria as an actress in that program).  It is this
aspect of the article that inspired the story above.
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="photo">
There are a number of copies of the image from <em>Seventeen</em>'s
<em>Daria's Pad</em> article on the Internet.  At the time of writing
(March 2004) a low-resolution scanned version can
be found at
<a href="http://www.outpost-daria.com/media_art06.html"><code>http://www.outpost-daria.com/media_art06.html</code></a>.
A different low-resolution version is available as
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/daria198099/dariaroom.jpg"><code>http://www.geocities.com/daria198099/dariaroom.jpg</code></a>.
(Spectacular high-resolution versions were available on various
<em>Daria</em> fan sites in the past.  Sadly, these sites no longer
seem to be on-line.)
The picture faces the opposite way from the double-page spread
of Daria's bedroom in <em>The Daria Diaries</em>, and thus shows
items near the door such as Daria's writing desk, computer,
Kafka poster, bookcase, bureau, skull paperweight,
world globe, large crystal, and the
"bone" poster on the back of her door (as well as various
objects visible in <em>The Daria Diaries</em> such as her chemistry set,
skeleton poster, box of human bones, and wall padding).
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="sara">
<em>Seventeen</em>'s <em>Daria's Pad</em>
article was credited to Sara Glassman.
The similarly-named but unrelated "Sara" in the story above
is entirely fictional.
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="season">
Since the <em>Seventeen</em> article was published in 1998 we
assume that this story takes place during <em>Daria</em>'s second
season.  (It thus occurs before third season episode
<em>The Lost Girls</em>, in which
Daria also gets involved with a magazine for teenagers, which is a shame
since it would have been nice to base Daria's expectations for
Sara on her encounter with <em>Val</em> magazine's Val.)
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="angermanagement">
Daria memorably yelled "What's that supposed to mean!?" at Jane during the
1998 <em>Daria Day</em> marathon when Jane dared question the effectiveness
of Daria's anger management classes.
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="remote">
<em>The Daria Diaries</em> notes that the remote control for the
"bolted" television in Daria's room is missing.  (It's not stated
whether the television itself works or not.)
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="fashionreporter">
Daria was made fashion reporter for <em>The Highland Herald</em> in
the <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em> episode <em>Sporting Goods</em>.
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="dialogue">
The scene above where Sara interviews Daria
is based on the quotes attributed to Daria in
<em>Seventeen</em>'s <em>Daria's Pad</em>
article.  The dialogue is not a verbatim copy,
however, on the assumption that Sara would paraphrase Daria's
comments when writing the article.
