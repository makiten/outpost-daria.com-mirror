<p class=MsoNormal>You all remember the end credit alter-egos, right? With <span

other animation styles and the like. The end credits of "Is It College Yet?"
showcased hilarious scenarios for the characters futures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, what if their lives really DID turn out that way? What
if Daria and Jane really did become breakfast TV hosts? What if Mr. DeMartino
really did become a mailman? Set in the year 2010, this collection of stories
known as "The Alter-Ego Chronicles" will look at these strange futures, and
examine how they ended up that way and how they've managed to embrace or reject
it. And in some cases, some lesser-known people that were never given a future
may be given one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stacy Rowe's career as a driver in the world-renowned SCUSA
series has stalled. Her team has almost run out of money and can't afford to
run her for full races. Despite her unlikely skill behind the wheel, other
drivers feel that she should give up. On the announcement by her well-meaning,
but money-hungry team owner that her next race will be her last, Stacy is on
the verge of a nervous breakdown. But a reunion with an old friend inspires
Stacy to throw everything into her last race of the year, the Ultra Cola 500 at
the brand new Lawndale Motor Speedway. Will this return to her former home town
bring a change of fortune for the former Fashion Club secretary, or will it be
the final nail in the coffin for her career and possibly her state of mind?</p>

Circuit Middlebury by trackside signage. Cut to a tracking shot of a white
stock car with a #2 on it, speeding around the oval, until it pulls into pit
lane and stops. The driver climbs out of the car, and takes off a plain white helmet,
as well as a fire-protective balaclava. It is Stacy Rowe, formerly of the
Fashion Club. She looks pretty much the same as she did in high school, right
down to the twin braids, except she is more muscular by virtue of fitness
training in her racing career. She walks over to her race engineer, Dewey
"Shaggy" Rogers, who is seated at the <span class=SpellE>pitside</span>
technical box, looking at many small monitors. <span class=SpellE>Shaggy's</span>...
well... shaggy hair is flowing out from under a cap with the name "<span

more left."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Stacy:</b> "Really? No more tyres? You've got to be
kidding me, Dewey..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Shaggy:</b> "I know you're angry right now, but please
don't call me Dewey. I hate that name."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Stacy:</b> "Sorry, Shaggy."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Shaggy:</b> "Money is tight, Stacy. We have to keep
starting-and-parking until we can get a full-time sponsor. It's not good, but
it's all we can do."</p>

Stacy, such as a bedroom, a small bathroom and a kitchen. Cut to team owner

the fuel and tyre costs these days."</p>

really want to do good there."</p>

nothing like a big performance at the home track to really stick it those who
doubted you. Is your family going to be there?"</p>

out of their work commitments in <st1:place>Africa</st1:place>. I don't know

various different cars)<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Martin (VO):</b> "A few years ago, Stacy Rowe was at the
forefront of motor racing's female revolution. Although she is still a talented
young driver, she has been cursed it seems by financial troubles, bad machinery
and in some cases, old-fashioned bad luck."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Martin (VO):</b> "Born and raised in Lawndale, Maryland,
Rowe was your everyday typical girl. She was interested in boys and fashion,
following many, if not all of the trends of the time. Not the average interests
for a future SCUSA driver, you would think. But Rowe was an athlete at heart. A
promising indoor volleyball player in high school, Rowe quit the sport when she
suffered serious head and facial injuries in a collision with a team-mate."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Stacy:</b> "It was a joke present from one of my
girlfriends. Wrapped in a lovely new shirt was a coupon for free hot laps in a
SCUSA Trophy car at the old Oakwood National Circuit. I never planned on using
it, but one day all my friends were busy and I was a bit bored, so I went and
used it. I guess I've never looked back since."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>(The report now shows pictures of Stacy in sprint car
racing, including one where she is very muddy but holding up a trophy, then of
her driving a race truck)<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Martin (VO):</b> "This was the adrenalin rush that
Stacy's life needed. Upon her graduation from college, Rowe would begin racing
professionally with the backing of Glenn Rowsthorn, who she still drives for
today. Her first stop was sprint car racing, where she became the youngest
female winner in the history of the Tri-County Championships. Then, in 2006,
she hit the asphalt in SCUSA Truck racing, driving for David Noble Trucks."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Martin (VO):</b> "Rowe would go on to finish 9th in the
final championship standings, achieving Rookie of the Year honours, along with
an excellent 3rd place finish at Swedesville. The next season, Rowe would split
her commitments between the Truck Series, and selected races in the Trophy
Series for Ross Fleet Motorsports. Despite a pair of 5th place finishes at
Middlebury and <span class=SpellE>Wappington</span> Mills, Rowe would slump to
21st in the Truck Series standings, and was released from her contract with
DNT."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Stacy:</b> "I'm an emotional person by nature, but I took
the release from DNT really badly. I cried for days, and I was considering
throwing it all away. It wasn't until I got a contract offer for the Cup Series

of nights earlier. The sequence is now in slow motion, and you can only hear a
rapid heartbeat. Cuts are made to Mr. <span class=SpellE>Rowsthorn</span>,
Stacy's pit crew, to the girls in the corporate box, to various people in the
crowd. All of them look scared. Cut back to Stacy, who is wide-eyed and <span

crash, again like in her dream. However, this time, she doesn't get clipped by
the car she tried to avoid, and makes it through the carnage unscathed. The
sequence goes back to full speed, the sound of the heartbeat transitions into
that of a roaring crowd)<o:p></o:p></i></p>

the yellow flags are out! The race will end under yellow flag conditions, and

in motorsport anywhere in the world this year. This 26-year-old from right here
in <st1:City><st1:place>Lawndale</st1:place></st1:City>, has overcome
unbelievable odds to win here today. Her team has been a start-and-park outfit
since the third race in <span class=SpellE>Wappington</span> Mills, but Stacy
Rowe has raced her heart out for the entire season, let alone today's 500
miles. While you can't deny that there was a lot of luck involved in the end,
you cannot say she didn't deserve it. I will go as far as saying that out of
anyone out there today, she probably deserved to win the most. Stacy Rowe,
today's winner of the Ultra Cola 500 at Lawndale Motor Speedway!"</p>
