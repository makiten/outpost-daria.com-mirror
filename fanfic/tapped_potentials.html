<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, wow..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Huge, emerald eyes wide in awe, eighteen-year-old Pris Henry
watched the perennial Perseid meteor shower from her vantage point atop her
parents' motor home. "This is so cool..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Like Pris and her family, a great number of people had come
out to the edge of the Highland city limits to watch the meteor shower; this
year, scientists had stated that because of the unusually clear weather over
the central United States, this would be a particularly good year to see the
shower, and many people were taking the opportunity to do just that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hey, Pris..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Not interested."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A pimple-faced man with sunglasses (yes, even at night)
started up the mounted ladder, but Pris <i>accidentally</i> dumped a pitcher of
iced tea on him. "Hey-!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sorry, Todd... my hand slipped."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Bitch!" The mullet-haired thuglet stomped away, the sound
of tea squishing inside his cowboy boots echoing in the night, followed by
muffled giggling. Pris looked about, and smiled as her eyes landed, not
unexpectedly, on a small, auburn-haired girl with glasses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Of course Daria would be here... and, of course, Daria
would have seen the sideshow along with the main event.</i> Pris liked the
eleven-year-old who lived with her family three houses down from her family,
and on occasion, let her borrow books from her mother's small, but impressive,
library. The kid already read more and comprehended more than most of the kids
in her own senior class, she reflected, but she didn't talk much, and rarely
showed much of herself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pris could respect that, and gave Daria her space. <i>That
kid's out of here as soon as she turns eighteen, she thought. The littleminds
aren't going to wear her down into one of their own &ndash; they'd better hope she
doesn't decide to start slicing them open with that tongue of hers. She's a
sharp little thing...<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A quintet of meteors lit up the sky, bringing sounds of
admiration from the scattered crowd; Pris noticed that Daria was quiet, yet her
eyes were wide and shining...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Yeah. She's not like the losers who decided that they
don't want to make an effort and get out of here. She'll do anything to leave;
you can see it in her eyes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The flurry of incoming meteors grew more intense; the
flashes of light as several collided in mid-flight, only to have the remaining
fragments burn away in the upper atmosphere, looked like giant fireworks high
in the sky. Feeling the nip of the cooling night desert air, Pris reached down
and zipped up her Air Force jacket, then turned her eyes skyward. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Yep. Just another month or so, and then I'll head over to
Lackland for Basic Training. I am so out of here... </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, we are not going to look for meteor fragments in the
middle of the night! Especially in the middle of the night!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Mommy, I don't wanna go looking for meteors &ndash; I wanna watch
the meteors!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Go chew your gum!'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"<i>Muh-ooooooom!</i> Daria's teasing me!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, stop teasing your sister. Quinn &ndash; do not swallow
that gum!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pris sighed as she ran long fingers through short-cropped,
jet-black hair. <i>The only reason Helen Morgendorffer's probably even out here
is because her boss at that law firm's here with his four bratty kids, and
probably mentioned it to her. Suck-up...<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I saw a couple of them hit! I know I saw them! I know where
it went &ndash; over by the cactus by Mariggan Creek-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria! We ARE NOT going and that's <i>final</i>!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria watched as her mother turned away and Quinn &ndash; her
little sister &ndash; smirked and stuck out her tongue before skittering over to
their mother and grabbing her hand. "Mommy, can we go home? I'm <i>so</i>
tired..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, I think we've seen enough of the fireworks for one
night &ndash; JAKE! Wake up! Why is it that you can't stay awake for one minute &ndash; We
have children to watch over! Here we are, out in the desert, at night, and YOU
can't be bothered to keep your eyes open!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"But, Helen-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Ooooooooh! Come on, we're leaving!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pris shook her head as the Morgendorffers started towards
their car, and she waved as Daria waved goodbye to her. <i>Poor kid... the trees,
over by Marrigan creek, hmn?<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>She'd probably like a couple of fragments... probably one of
the few people around here who'd appreciate them for what they were...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>*****</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hey, Pris! The principal wants you in his office!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pris looked up from her locker, shrugged, and closed it
before she turned and walked down the hall and around a corner to the
principal's office... only, a crowd of students was gathered outside. "Pris &ndash;
what did you do?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Nothing..." She went inside and passed through another
gauntlet of staring students and adults, only to be let into the principal's
office, where the principal, a trio of serious-looking Air Force officers (two
men and a woman), a very handsome Army officer with the Green Beret of Special
Forces, and an African-American Marine officer were waiting for her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1>Wow... look at the beefcake... looks like I did the right thing by signing up... </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Miss Henry, these gentleman want to talk to you," the
principal said, obviously cowed by the military officers in his office.
"They've questions for you about-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"In the past eighteen hours, have you come into contact with
any meteor fragments?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pris turned to the Marine, and noticed how the other
officers grimaced ever so slightly at his directness. "Yes..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Where did you find them, and where are they now?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Over by Marrigan Creek, a few hundred feet away from a
clump of cacti, and at my house-"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Something suddenly told her that it wouldn't be a good idea to mention
that she had taken one of the larger fragments over to Daria's house that
morning (under the guise of picking up her mother's copy of the <i>Lesser Edda</i>)<i>.</i>
"They're in my room. You want them? Why? They're just fragments-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Did you give any of them to anyone, and did anyone go with
you when you found them?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The female Air Force officer took a device the size of a
pocket radio from her attach&eacute; case. "Please hold up your hands."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pris did as she was asked; the woman looked at the reading,
and nodded to the Air Force colonel, the shortest person in the room. "All
right, then. Principal - no matter. Please give this young woman her diploma.
She'll be coming with us."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Marine drew himself to his full height, and the SF
officer turned when the Colonel faced them both, an amused look on his face.
"Don't even argue, Davers &ndash; and you can forget any tricks you've got planned,
Armalin. She's already in the Air Force."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Excuse me &ndash; but I don't go in until next month, until after
I graduate..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Colonel took another look at the device, then turned
back to look at Pris. "Plans change in the military, Airman Henry. You're in,
as of <i>right now</i>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>*****</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Present day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Why are you listening to <i>that</i> CD, Jane?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane Lane looked up from her canvas to see Daria
Morgendorffer standing in the door of her room in <i>Schloss</i> Morgendorffer,
a can of Ultra Cola in each hand. "What, are you trying to be hip by listening
to the dance music of when we were 'tweens?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hey, don't knock C&amp;C Music Factory! It is real music!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That's what you said about ska..." She walked in, and handed
Jane her soda. "At least you aren't trying to dance like that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hey, I'll have you know that I, Jane Lane, Mistress of all
that is Art, am a damned fine dancer!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Does the phrase 'Two left feet' sound familiar? It should,
because you left them somewhere in order to not embarrass yourself dancing!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, now you're going to get it..." A sneaky look crossed the
young artist's face. "Quinn told me how you were the fashion editor on that
paper your freshman year in school..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I feel a nightmare coming on..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"She also told me about 'Party Daria', and how she could
dance..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Never happened."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, if you don't shut my mouth by showing me how you're a
better dancer than me, well... I think I'll have to spread the word about how we
have a previously unrevealed Dancing Queen here at Lawndale High!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria stopped in mid-step, and paled. "You wouldn't..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Defeat raised its hooded head, and struck. "Fine. Just this
one time..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Fine by me &ndash; IF you can actually dance..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"As many times as I've had to watch that video when we were
little, I know it by heart &ndash; Quinn was too hung up on MTV. God, what an insipid
channel..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Always had to watch what she wanted?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"The fairy princess <u>always</u> won the right to the
remote. Fashion shows, beauty pageants, history of fashion design, even stupid
half-hour makeup infomercials. At least they didn't bother me if I read while
she was watching her brainfluff programs... but, yeah, I had to watch that stuff
over, and over, and over... I was so glad when we moved here and I got my own
room &ndash; and my own TV."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, that means you know all the moves! Start hoofing!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria sighed, and stepped into the middle of the floor as
Jane reset the CD player; the opening beats of 'Gonna Make You Sweat', began to
play, and Daria began to move...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>*****</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane sat on the edge of Daria's bed, her mouth locked open
is complete surprise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moments earlier, she watched as Daria danced; danced better
than she ever could, better than anyone she'd seen at school &ndash; even better than
some of the cheerleaders, or some of the people who took it seriously. As she
watched Daria perform the dance routine from that C&amp;C Music Factory video
with the same flawless moves that the dancers did, Jane noticed something
interesting... that Daria was really getting into it... that this was something she
really loved to do...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Man, she could do this professionally, if she wanted to...
Daria as a professional dancer... man, that would shock every single person who
knows her, and Quinn would hate it, because Daria would get way more attention
than her-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"JANE-!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria jumped as the contents of Jane's soda exploded all
over her. "Oh, thanks. Now I get to go scrub Ultra Cola out of my hair."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah, well, that's what you get for scaring me like that!"</p>

Jane waggled her eyebrows, and Daria rolled her eyes. "-I'll raid the
refrigerator. Does your dad have any of that spicy Italian meatballs in the
mushroom pasta sauce left?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"His Mount Etna recipe? Yeah &ndash; there's more than a bit left.
Dad just can't seem to understand that his 'hot' puts people in the hospital.
At least Mom made him fix the meatballs separate from the sauce, so normal
people can actually eat them."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Daria grabbed a towel, Jane said, "Don't spend too long
in there &ndash; otherwise, I'll have to call Trent and have him come in as a one-man
search party."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Look at the date on the calendar, Lane. That era is past."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>*****</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Several minutes later, Daria stood before the mirror in the
bathroom, toweling her hair dry when her eyes fell upon Quinn's handheld
hairdryer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Look, a weapon of the Shallow Ones...</i> She hesitated a
moment, then took her towel away from her head before picking up the dryer and
flicking it on. She began to run it over her head, and as she did, it was as if
her hands took on a life of their own...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She reached for a hairbrush, and her gaze fell upon Quinn's
eyeliner...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>*****</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hey, Miss Van Winkle! Get your butt out here!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane sat her plate of meatballs on Daria's desk, and knocked
on the door. "What's up in there &ndash; did you fall in, or meet the love of your
life? Weigh anchor in there, already!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, hello, Jane," Helen Morgendorffer said, poking her head
into Daria's room. "When Daria comes out, please tell her that I'd like to talk
to her downstairs- oh, my..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A supermodel stepped out of the bathroom. <i>"Daria...?"</i>
Jane gasped, coming to her feet. What... what the hell happened to you in there?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen was struck mute at the sight of the auburn-haired
woman who turned to face her, complete with perfectly applied makeup and a
hairstyle that would have cost four figures in a major salon. "My... my...<i>ohhhhhhhh</i>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The older woman fainted dead away as Quinn bounced up and
caught her before she hit the floor. "Mom? What happened? Daria, what's wrong
with-"?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn looked up as Daria stepped into view, and the sound of
her scream was heard several blocks away. "Somehow, I knew she'd have reaction
if this day ever came," Jane said, her food forgotten as she walked up to her
friend &ndash; <i>my best friend, the supermodel</i>, she smirked. "What the hell did
you do to yourself &ndash; get swallowed by a copy of <i>The Princess Diaries</i>?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria gave her a glare that proved without doubt that it was
actually her. "Yeah &ndash; I read. What happened?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't know," she stuttered. "It was like, I started to
towel my hair off, I saw Quinn's dryer, and then, my hands had a mind of their
own. They," she motioned to herself, "they did this... the way it was going, it
all felt as if this was right &ndash; as if this is the way it should be..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You're kidding-? You've developed super-powers?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, there's no such-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane darted past her into the bathroom, and came out with a
hand mirror, which she thrust into Daria's face. "That hairstyle alone would
cost several hundred dollars and take a few hours if you went to a beauty salon
&ndash; and you came out like that in ten minutes! What else would you call it?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane, don't say it-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You've got the super-power to apply makeup and do hair
perfectly? Oh, this is TOO funny!" Jane laughed, and Daria kicked her feet out
from underneath; she landed on her rump, and kept laughing. 'Please &ndash; tell me
that you don't have the power to coordinate and accessorize perfectly, too...?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The look on Daria's face said it all. "I have a strange
feeling that... yeah. Yeah &ndash; I probably can..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane's laughter said it all. 'Oh, that's too perfect! That's
cosmic justice! I can see it now &ndash; 'Miss M - Fighting Crimes Against Fashion!
Will you design me a cute little sidekick outfit, and let me date your male
stripper minions?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn looked up to see Daria turn towards her, and the way
Daria's hair moved as she turned &ndash; the way the light caught it to bring out the
perfect shades of color, the way it had the perfect amount of fullness, and
bounce...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A tear slid down the redhead's cheek, and Jane smiled at
her. "Oh, look on the bright side, Quinn. Now, Daria can give <i>you</i> the <u>perfect
makeover</u>!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The way Quinn began to cry brought a smile to both Jane and
Daria's faces.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>THE END</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>
