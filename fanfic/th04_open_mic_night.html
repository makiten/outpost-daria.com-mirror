style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Jane opened the front
door of her home and greeted her two best friends with a semi-lucid "Yo."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Morning to you too
sunshine," responded Daria dully, drawing a smirk from her brother.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Here... hold this," stated
Jane through yawns as she shoved her full coffee cup into Alex's hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>The young man brought the
cup closer to his face and inhaled the aroma.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"This isn't your usual
instant stuff," he commented.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>He and Daria had been witness
to Jane's usual morning routine on multiple occasions and could definitely tell
the coffee in the cup was of a much higher quality from its much richer and
fuller aroma.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Oh yeah, this stuff is a
big step up from the instant crystals," Jane responded as she stowed a large
thermos into her backpack. "Mom came back from... Sue Tommy, or something like
that a week ago,"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Sao Tome?" corrected
Daria inquisitively.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"That's it. Anyway, she
brought a bunch of colored linen and a metric crap-load of the stuff with her.
She even brought a new coffee grinder with her. Takes a little more work to
make a pot, but definitely worth it."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I can imagine. The stuff
smells strong," remarked Alex. "Good, but strong."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Just the way I like it,"
Jane replied, as she took a long sip from the steaming cup.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"It also comes in handy
when I run out of paint thinner," the artist remarked as the trio began their
morning sojourn to Lawndale High.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"So you guys hear about
the break-in at <b>.Com</b> last night?" Jane asked after they had walked for a
few minutes in amiable silence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I saw something about it
in the paper this morning," replied Daria. "Did they run something on the TV
news this morning?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"No clue," answered Jane
after swallowing a mouthful of coffee. "Trent told me about it last night. He
and the guys drove past it on the way home from McGrundy's and said there were
a bunch of cop cars in front of the place."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"The paper said that the
front window was smashed and six of the computers were taken," remarked Daria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"As much as I'd love to
have a computer," began Jane between sips of coffee. "I just can't see myself
trashing a coffee shop to get one."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"So... no need to search
Stately Lane Manor for purloined electronics?" asked Alex jokingly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I don't like moving my
easel from one room to another. Can you see me running through the streets of
Lawndale toting six computer towers?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Fair enough," replied
Alex with a chuckle as an image of Jane hunched over with six computers
strapped to her back, like a cybernetic Sherpa floated through his head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Jane downed the last of
her coffee in one gulp and stashed the empty cup in her pack as she and the
twins approached the front driveway of the school.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;background:white'><span
style='color:black'>

<hr size=2 width="100%" align=center>

</span></div>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Alright class! I've got
your tests from yesterday graded." came the shrill, nasally voice of Janet
Barch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>The 40ish woman picked up
the stack of papers and turned her slit eyed gaze upon the students of her
sophomore science class. Her face settled into its all too familiar disdainful
scowl as she surveyed the right side of the classroom; the side of the room on
which she had segregated the male students.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"MacKenzie!" barked the
woman, "Get up here and return these pitiful tests to the rest of your
testosterone poisoned so-called half of the human species!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Yes ma'am," replied Mack
as quickly rose from his seat and walked to the front of the class.<br>
He accepted the papers from Barch, carefully ensuring he avoided direct eye
contact with the woman, and then quickly began distributing them to the other
male students.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Brittany," said the
teacher in a vastly different, almost cheerful tone. "Be a dear and pass these
out to the young ladies."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Sure Ms. Barch," chirped
the busty cheerleader.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Brittany hopped out of
her seat and cheerily began handing papers out to the girls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Daria looked at the test
paper she had just been handed and gave a subdued smiled at the "100 A+"
circled in the top corner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Jane accepted the paper
from Brittany and grinned. She held her quiz up to the side to show Daria.<br>
Daria glanced over towards Jane and noted the "80 B-&quot; and gave her friend
a thumbs up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><i><span style='color:black'>'Looks like studying
with the dynamic duo paid off after all,'</span></i><span style='color:black'>
thought Jane as she set her quiz back onto her desk and opened her text book to
the chapter Barch mentioned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Daria turned to her brother
sitting beside her on the 'Male' side of the center aisle and immediately took
notice of his confused expression.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"There was some
improvement from the last quiz. But not enough for my satisfaction, which tells
me we need to go back over some of the material in the previous chapter," the
teacher began as she turned to the blackboard and began erasing the chalk
inscribed words from it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Um... Ms. Barch," the boy
began. "I think there's been a mistake with my grade."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Daria craned her neck and
saw '71 C-' boldly displayed on the top corner of Alex's quiz.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><i><span style='color:black'>'What in the...'</span></i><span
style='color:black'> began Daria mentally as she unconsciously raised an
eyebrow at her brothers, less than stellar grade.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Movement in his
peripheral vision caused, Alex to turn his head towards the other boys in the
class. Charles, Mack and a few of the others were shaking their heads violently
at him and/or making Stop/Don't/Turn back now motions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Alex felt the paper being
removed from his hand and turned to see his sister examining his quiz.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><i><span style='color:black'>'What in the world
could he have answered that poorly to get such a low grade?'</span></i><span
style='color:black'> Daria asked herself as she placed her brother's quiz on
her desk beside her own and began alternating her gaze between the two papers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><i><span style='color:black'>'The multiple-choice
answers are the same as mine. Looks like those are marked correctly,'</span></i><span
style='color:black'> she thought as she compared the two tests. <i>'Hmmm... looks
like all of the essay and a good number of the fill-in-the-blank questions are
marked as wrong.'</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>The distraction created
by his male cohorts' exaggerated warnings and his sister taking the quiz from
his hand prevented the boy from immediately noticing Ms. Barch had moved from
the blackboard to a position directly in front of his desk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"So you have a problem
with my grading method <i>Mister</i> Morgendorffer?!" demanded Barch fiercely.
"Think I should have gone easy on you like the other teachers?!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Alex leaned back in his
seat as much as the rigid frame would allow, and stared at the raving teacher
with a confused and worried expression.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Well you may get breezed
through by your worthless male teachers, but you're not going to get a free
ride in their classes, but not in my house mister!" the woman raved as she
leaned in and glared at Alex.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Ms Barch," Daria
interrupted. "These answers are right.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"What?!" exclaimed the
fuming teacher.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"If you compare his to
mine," continued Daria, ignoring the hostility radiating off the older woman as
she held up both Alex's test and her own. "His answers are either the same or
close enough to mine to be counted correct. That assumes the 100 you gave me
wasn't an error as well..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Further argument was cut
short by the sounding of the bell.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Well since there seems
to have been a problem with the grading of the tests," resumed the disgruntled
teacher. "That means we'll just have to have another test tomorrow, now won't
we?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>The students let out
complaints of varying degree as they gathered their belongings and began filing
out of the room for their next class.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>No one noticed the cold
glare Ms. Barch leveled at the back of Alex as he, Jane and Daria left the
class.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;background:white'><span
style='color:black'>

<hr size=2 width="100%" align=center>

</span></div>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"You know you're not
going to survive much longer if you keep antagonizing the raging she-beast like
that," remarked Jane as she and the twins made their way to their next class.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Hey, it's not my fault
she miss-graded my test. I'm not going to screw up my GPA because her
ex-husband did a job on her," replied Alex. "But seriously, what was up with
the grade she gave me?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"It's almost as if she
purposefully counted his answers wrong," stated Daria casually.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Knowing Barch, that's
exactly what she did," responded Jane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>The twins came to a stop
and looked at Jane with inquisitive expressions. The artist realized the pair
was no longer walking and turned around.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"You're... serious aren't
you?" asked Daria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Alex merely stood in place
and blinked in obvious disbelief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Why wouldn't I be,"
asked Jane as if it were the most normal response in the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"OK..." began Alex as his
brain restarted and the trio began walking again. "So she grades the guys more...
strictly than she grades the girls?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"That's a nice way of
putting it," replied Jane. "She grades the students the same way she treats
them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"So she screws the guys
over and breezes the girls through," stated Daria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Got it in one," replied
Jane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Alex furrowed his brow
and angrily stated, "That is the most unethical pile of crap I've ever heard!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"This is Lawndale High,"
retorted Jane. "I'm sure having no ethics is a pre-requisite for a teaching
position here."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><i><span style='color:black'>'Especially with Li
running things,' </span></i><span style='color:black'>added Jane mentally.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"True," conceded Daria.
"But that doesn't explain why she hasn't been 'miss-grading' Lex's other tests
and quizzes until now."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"That's actually the easy
part to figure out," remarked Alex. "Up to this point, she's been giving us
multiple choice ONLY exams."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Good point," added Jane.
"She couldn't screw the guy's tests over without either screwing the girls over
as well or making it blatantly obvious that she's playing gender favorites."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"It's still insane that
she's even been allowed to pull a stunt like that," the boy continued. "It's
even more unbelievable that she's been able to do it for long enough that the
student's consider it par for the course."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Well the girls don't
really have a problem, so we're generally not going to complain. Lord knows,
with my grades, I'm not going to turn down a slight upward bump here and
there," stated the raven-haired girl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Fair enough," stated
Alex. "But I can't believe the guys just lay down and let her walk all over
their grades like that."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Well most of them are
only skating by in their classes anyway," Jane responded. "And even if they
weren't, they're probably too scared of the woman to complain about it. Hell,
until you two showed up, I'd say Mack, Jodie and Upchuck were the only people
to get A's and B's regularly enough for it to even matter much."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"So how are Mack and
Charles getting 'normal' grades when the rest of the boys don't?" asked Daria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Mack is captain of the
football team. The last thing Barch wants to do is piss Li off because she
flunked someone bringing 'Honor and Glory to Lawndale High'," Jane reminded the
pair. "It probably ticks her off that she has to give him decent grades."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Jodie doesn't strike me
as the kind to be OK with her boyfriend being given a free ride through his
classes?" asked Daria with a small scowl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Who said anything about
being given a free ride?" Jane replied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"You just said Barch is
upset about having to 'give him decent grades'," reminded Alex<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Well yeah. Barch hates
having to give the guys any kind of credit. You guys should have been here when
he got his 1st A from her," Jane said with a chuckle. "I swear I thought she
was going to explode."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Jane stopped laughing as
she realized what Daria had implied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Wait. You thought Barch
was being forced to pass Mack?" she asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>The twins glanced at each
other and nodded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Jeez you two," said Jane
with a roll of her eyes. "Mack earns his grades kids. If it was just about the
team getting passed do you honestly think the J's or, Heaven forbid, Kevin
would have more than the C's and D's they get in her class when Mack brings
home B's?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Wait that doesn't
explain why Charles isn't flunking her class," commented Alex. "We all know
he's definitely earning his A's."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"True, and Upchuck isn't
on any of the teams. How's he avoiding the 'Barch Effect'?" inquired Daria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Probably has to do with
his dad being a former Lawndale Lion himself," replied Jane. "I remember Jodie
saying something once about Mr. Ruttheimer being one of the bigger Alumni Fund
donors."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"And if there's anything Ms.
Li values more than Honor and Glory, it's financial backing," added Daria. "Li
would go out of her way to avoid upsetting an alumnus who has children
attending the school."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Especially one with deep
pockets," finished Jane with a smirk. "And you can definitely bet <i>that </i>ticks
her off. Especially when Upchuck acts like... well... Upchuck."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"So I have to either join
the football team or get Mom and Dad to donate a wing to the school to get
graded fairly by Barch," grumbled Alex dejectedly. "It just gets better and
better here every day."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><i><span style='color:black'>'We'll figure
something out,' </span></i><span style='color:black'>Daria thought as she
watched her brother complain about their latest educational revelation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>The three soon reached
their lockers and saw Brittany, Mack and Kevin conversing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;Excuse us,&quot;
said Daria, which cause both football players to look behind the quarterback.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Daria and Alex stood
behind Kevin looking expectantly at the lockers he was leaning against. Jane
leaned casually against the lockers behind them and gave a salutatory nod to
Mack.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;Hey,&quot; greeted
Mack as he pulled Kevin away from the twins' lockers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;Hey Daria, you're a
chick, right?&quot; asked Kevin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;Unless things have
made a drastic change since this morning, yes,&quot; deadpanned Daria as she
turned the combination knob a final time and opened her locker.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;Like, why should I
be interested in anything this Shakespeare guy says?&quot; asked Kevin,
completely missing the sarcasm pouring off of the petite girl's reply.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;You? Well...&quot;
said Daria with a contemplative pause. &quot;Hamlet does have a skull in it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;And don't forget
the sword fights in Romeo and Juliet,&quot; added Alex as his sister stepped
aside to allow him access to the lower locker beneath hers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;Actually, most of
Shakespeare's plays had a fight or battle of some kind,&quot; commented Mack as
he closed his locker.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;Really?&quot; asked
Kevin with an enthusiastic expression. &quot;Cool.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;Though his
tragedies always seem a bit too 'Days of Our Lives' for my tastes. I much
preferred <u>The Comedy of Errors</u>,&quot; the football captain added with a
smirk as he walked away from the group towards his next class.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Daria quirked an eyebrow
at the unexpected literary reference and followed her brother and friend into
class.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span></div>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>O'Neill walked slowly
around his desk and leaned against it casually. He smiled lightly at his
students before allowing a more serious expression to slip over his face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Class," began the man
solemnly as he brushed a bit of chalk dust from his lapel. "I thought today
we'd take a break from the tragedy of <u>Romeo and Juliet</u> to discuss the
real life tragedy that happened last night here in Lawndale. Let's share our
feelings of violation following the loss of our beloved cybercaf&eacute;, .Com. Who
would like to start?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>He glanced expectantly
around the room. When no one volunteered his eyes lit on the bored face of
Kevin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Charles?" the teacher
prompted Kevin but received no outward response from the boy. "Charles, did you
hear me?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;Yes Mr.
O'Neill,&quot; responded Upchuck, which prompted the teacher to look at him
confusedly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>The quarterback realized
O'Neill was actually addressing him and responded, "You mean, Kevin?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Kevin, heh. I'm sorry,"
the befuddled man said as he realized the seating chart he referenced was
upside down. "What do you have to say about last night's horrible event?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I was home all night.
You can ask my parents. Besides, I already have a computer," Kevin hastily
stated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"No doubt, serving
admirably as a doorstop," commented Daria quietly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Hey, you can play Madden
on the computer," quipped Alex just as quietly back to his sister.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Besides, we all know what
Kevin would <i>really</i> be using the Internet for," whispered Jane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>The twins raised eyebrows
at their friend and, with a smirk, Alex asked, "And what pr&ecirc;t ell would that
be?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Jane responded by hiding
her face with her sketchbook and pretending to draw.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I swear, just when the
nightmares begin to go away..." grumbled Daria as she realized the direction
Jane's line of thinking had taken.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I think the cybercaf&eacute;
served one very particular segment of the community, but it still pisses me off
when people take what isn't theirs."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Jodie's comments caught
the trio's attention and caused them to give their attention back to the topic
being discussed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"That's how I feel!"
agreed Kevin enthusiastically.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Thank you, Kevin,"
stated O'Neill with a small sigh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Jodie, about that word,
'community.' Isn't that the whole idea of a cybercaf&eacute;? To jack us into the
global community? I think what's most disturbing about this crime is the
symbolism involved. Don't you agree, Jane?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Not really, no,"
responded Jane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>O'Neill continued his
rant, without acknowledging Jane had disagreed with him "Suddenly, we're cut
off. We can't hail our friends across the globe and say, 'It's a beautiful day
in the cyberhood.'"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>The majority of the class
stared at O'Neill with a bemused expression, waiting to see where the man was
going to take his rant while simultaneously dreading it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"They didn't just take a
few computers," Timothy continued. "They took the symbol of our virtual
community. To visit .Com was to come together with the planet!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Oh, come on," stated
Daria. "You can't be serious."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>O'Neill paused in mid
step at the outburst and regarded Daria with a confused expression.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Yes?" he inquired
hesitantly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Come together with the
planet? By staring at a screen for hours? Sitting in a room full of people you
never say a word to?" remarked Daria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>O'Neill put his fist
against his chin and leaned his head to the side thoughtfully and said, "Hmm.
Interesting point, Dorian."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Daria!" both twins and
Jane exclaimed simultaneously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>The teacher jumped back a
step at the vehement correction. He reached for his seating chart and noticed
his error.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Uh! Damn spiders," the
embarrassed teacher responded as he made feaux motions of smacking an insect
before he continued. "Daria, you believe that while connecting Lawndale
citizens to our global neighbors, the cafe was alienating us from each other."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I'm saying if you really
miss the place, put a Mr. Coffee in the computer lab," replied the girl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"So, in your opinion,
what we really need is a return to the traditional coffee house of yore, where
you'd watch some performers and share a cup with your friends, face to face,"
the man concluded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Alex leaned to Jane and
asked, "Did I just have a stroke and miss half of the conversation?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Daria, you're a
visionary," teased Jane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I agree," nodded
O'Neill. "Right here and now, let's pledge to make Daria's dream a reality."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"The one with leash laws
for stupid people?" Alex asked his sister.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I've always been fond of
the one with Quinn stuck in the witch's oven," added Daria with a small smile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"You sure it's not the
one where you see yourself standing in sort of sun-goddess robes on a pyramid
with a thousand muscled guys in loincloths chanting your name and throwing little
pickles at you?" asked Jane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>The entire class stared
silently at Jane for several moments. Alex and Daria turned to again regard
their friend with single raised eyebrows.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Or that could just be
me..." she said as she again used her sketchbook to hide her face (which was
close to matching the shade of her lipstick).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Mr. O'Neill blinked a few
times and recovered quickly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"The coffee house!" he
exclaimed, which drew the students' attention again. "We'll plan it, raise the
money, and open it!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Would that qualify as an
extracurricular activity?" asked Daria with a pained expression apparent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Yes," replied O'Neill
instantly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"And you expect me to
participate don't you?" she asked, although she already knew the answer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Of course," came the
teacher's reply.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Then I'd like to
register as a conscientious objector," Daria stated flatly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Come on Daria. You have
to work to make your dream come true," quipped Jane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Alex leaned over towards
Jane and whispered, "You do realize both of us are going to get dragged into
this debacle?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Jane looked at the boy in
confusion for a second before it clicked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Ah crap," she swore
quietly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<hr size=2 width="100%" align=center>

</span></div>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>The kitchen was quiet at
the Morgendorffer house on a Saturday afternoon as Alex, Daria and Jake sat
quietly in their usual places at the kitchen table and read from sections of
the Lawndale Post.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Helen walked into the
kitchen long enough to grab a Powerbar from a box on the refrigerator and said,
"Hi! Gotta change, dinner meeting."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Jake looked up from his
paper a few seconds after his wife left the room, turned to Daria and asked,
"Did something just happen?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Hmm... Depends on your
perspective," replied Daria without interrupting her own reading.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Jake shrugged and went
back to reading the paper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;I'm going to
Rhapsody with Charles to pick up some strings. Be back later,&quot; said Alex
as he stood and picked up his violin case from the floor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>He then walked over to
the fridge, grabbed a bottle of water from it and headed out of the kitchen
towards the front of the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>A few moments later the
sound of the front door opening and closing caught Jake's attention and
prompted him to ask, &quot;Did I just miss something?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;No more than usual
Dad,&quot; responded Daria with a smirk as she flipped the page of the section
of paper she was reading.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Quinn strode through the
kitchen and retrieved a yogurt cup from the fridge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Hi! No dinner for me!
Emergency meeting of the Fashion Club," stated the redhead as she began to head
back out of the kitchen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I'll make up a nice plate
for you and cover it up with cling wrap," quipped Daria as Quinn exited the
kitchen completely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Jake managed to catch a
glimpse of his youngest daughter on her way out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"That was Quinn," he said
with a smile towards Daria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;Yes,&quot;
confirmed Daria as she set the portion of the news she had just finished down
and reached for the remaining folded sections of the paper. &quot;But you still
haven't identified Mystery Guests 1 and 2."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Dammit," swore Helen as
she walked back into the kitchen a few minutes later and leaned against the
island counter top. "I just called Eric for directions and he said the
meeting's canceled."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Well, that just gives us
the chance for a family dinner," she added more cheerfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I'll throw another steak
on the grill then," commented Daria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"We're having steak?"
asked Jake as he lowered his paper with a grin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"No Dad," replied Daria
with a sigh. "No steaks."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Aw man," remarked Jake
dejectedly before he resumed reading.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Quinn entered the kitchen
long enough to toss the now empty yogurt container in the trashcan and gave a
quick "Later" before she walked back out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Helen leaned slightly to
the side and watched Quinn grab her purse from the couch before exiting through
the front door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Where's she going?"
Helen asked with a glance in Daria's direction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Some kind of emergency
meeting or crisis with the Fashion Club," replied Daria. "Someone probably woke
up with frosted hair."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Oh. Well it's good to
see her so... involved with her club duties," commented Helen as she slid into
her usual seat next to Jake. "You know, Daria, it wouldn't hurt if you got
involved in some after school projects once in a while."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><i><span style='color:black'>'Here we go again,'</span></i><span
style='color:black'> came Daria's mental response as she stopped reading and
closed her eyes in frustration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I mean Quinn is in the
Fashion Club, Alex has Band or Orchestra or whatever they're calling it these
days..." continued Helen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Can't talk now,"
interrupted Daria, as she ensured the newspaper hid her face from her mother.
"I'm chairing a meeting of the Resting Quietly Club."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I'm serious. When you
apply to college, they're going to be looking for that kind of thing. Right,
Jake?" said Helen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Mmmhmm," replied Jake
noncommittally without lowering his own paper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Actually, they're going
to be more interested in whether I can pay for school," countered Daria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Jake, tell her," said
Helen with a look to Jake's direction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>She saw that Jake
apparently wasn't paying attention to the discussion. She snatched his
newspaper from his hands and set it down on the table in front of him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Tell her!" she demanded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Huh, what?" he asked as
he noticed his wife's growing anger.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Tell her about the
importance of extracurricular activities for getting into college," Helen
prompted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Oh! Well, these days
it's more about whether you can pay or not," the Morgendorffer patriarch stated
in an off-handed manner, before he snapped his paper once again into an upright
position.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Jake, you're not
helping..." Helen remarked wearily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Have you thought about a
living will, Dad?" asked Daria with a smirk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Not really," he responded
casually before he paused and again lowered his paper to look at his eldest
daughter. "Do you think I need one?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Helen rolled her eyes and
let out a small sigh at her husband and daughter's antics and said, "Just think
about it, Daria. That's all I ask."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"OK Mom," replied Daria.
"I'll think about it."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><i><span style='color:black'>'I'll think about not
wasting my summer on some crappy irrelevant activity,'</span></i><span
style='color:black'> she added mentally as she reached for the next section of
newspaper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Because, I'd hate for
you to have to make up for a lack of extracurricular activities over the
summer," Helen added.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"You wouldn't," remarked
Daria as she stopped mid-reach. "Wait, what am I thinking? Of course you
would."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I saw a pamphlet for a
lovely music camp for young women earlier this week..." stated Helen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Music camp huh? How come
you don't play your flute any more Daria?" asked Jake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I haven't played the
flute in years, Dad," she replied. "I stopped playing partly because I wasn't
any good at it. Music was always Lex's thing."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Oh yeah," responded
Jake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Though, mostly I also
stopped playing because you ran over my flute, Lex's violin and Quinn's
clarinet with the car," reminded Daria. "Lex is the only one who wanted a
replacement after that."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Oh yeah," repeated Jake
in a more regretful manner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Consequently," continued
Daria. "I would have to interpret being sent to a girls' music camp as
punishment for doing something very, <b>very</b> wrong."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Nonsense," contradicted
Helen with a wave of her hand. "It would just be an easy way of getting some
extracurricular activity on your college applications... if you weren't able to
come up with any on your own."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I've already come up
with something on my own,&quot; responded Daria. &quot;I came up with the idea
of having a simple, stress-free, normal summer for the first time in as long as
I can remember.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;Dammit, Daria! Why
does everything have to be so difficult with you?" asked Helen vehemently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Probably because you
insist on making everything so difficult for us," Daria retorted dryly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I'm not trying to make
things difficult for you," replied Helen angrily. "I just want to look out for
your future. I want to make sure you have every opportunity available to you."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"You know what, it's
fine," replied Daria in a voice even further devoid of emotion or inflection
than normal. "I was wondering when it would be my turn to get sent away."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Kiddo..." Jake began with
an apologetic expression that managed to begin soothing Daria's flared anger.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Unfortunately Helen
interrupted her husband with a fervent, "Now that's unfair Daria!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Welcome to my world,"
snarked Daria as she stood and headed out of the kitchen. "I'm going to
Jane's."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Helen sat slack-jawed as
her eldest daughter left the room. She and Jake jumped reflexively at the sound
as the front door was slammed on Daria's departure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I swear, I don't know
what to do with that girl anymore," complained Helen after she had regained her
senses. "The nerve..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Honey, why don't you go
take your shoes off and try to relax?"soothed Jake with a pat on his wife's
knee. "I'll try to talk to her later"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><i><span style='color:black'>'As if that will do
any good,'</span></i><span style='color:black'> Helen commented mentally as she
stood from the table. "You're right Jake. I'll just go relax for a bit then
start diner."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>She exited the kitchen without
waiting for his response, removing her low heeled shoes on the way to the
stairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>After his wife left, Jake
glanced to his son's usual chair and noticed it was empty. He gave a confused
glance around the kitchen and noticed that he was completely alone in the room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Where's Alex?" he asked
the empty room, before he shrugged and resumed reading his paper in peace and
quiet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>The front doors of <i>Rhapsody</i>
slid open as Alex and Charles exited the music store.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"So what do you want to
do now?" asked Charles as he reviewed his receipt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I don't know," replied
Alex as he deposited his own receipt and his newly acquired sleeves of strings
into the pocket of his green Army jacket. "What do you want to do?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Now don't start that?"
said Charles with a faux British accent. "But seriously, what's the plan for
today? Or are we going to go with our usual loosely structured lolly-gagging?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"If feels more like a
semi-organized dawdling kind of day," answered Alex.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>At that moment Alex's
stomach chose to voice its opinion in the matter as it began to grumble loudly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Good grief man, if you
were hungry you could have just said so instead of scaring the locals with your
best Rancor impression," chided Charles with a chuckle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I'd rather <b>sound</b>
like a rancor than share the face of one," teased Alex in response. "Might as
well check on the food plans for the evening."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Without being prompted,
Charles reached into the breast pocket of his teal polo shirt and offered his
cell phone to his companion. Alex quickly dialed the number to his own house
and waited patiently for someone to answer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><i><span style='color:black'>'Quinn's at one of the
girls' houses so I know she's not tying up the line,' </span></i><span
style='color:black'>thought the boy as the phone chimed with the 8th ring. <i>'Someone
pick up.' </i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Hello," came Jake's
voice after the 10th ring.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Hey Dad," greeted Alex.
"Charles and I were out and about and I was calling to see what the diner plans
were."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Oh, your mother and I
were planning to order Chinese," Jake responded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Charles and I are about
two blocks away from Good Times. We can pick up the food and save the delivery
costs," offered Alex. "You guys want the usual?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"That works," answered
Jake. "You should call Daria at Jane's and see if she wants anything."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Why is Dia at Jane's?"
asked Alex. "We were supposed to brainstorm about our assignment for English
class."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Well...," began Jake
hesitantly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Mom and Dia got into it
again didn't they?" asked Alex rhetorically.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Jake gave Alex his
fragmented recollection of the conversation that led to Daria leaving the
house. The boy sighed and shook his head at the situation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I don't think having
them try to hash it out again would be a good idea until both of them calm
down," stated Jake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"You're going to try to
calm Mom down about it right?" the boy asked his father hopefully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Yeah I'll try," replied
Jake. "Could you talk to your sister for me I'd..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"The water's just hot
enough Jakey. Did you remember to bring up the baby oil and the straws?" came
the sound of Helen's voice in the background.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"They should still be in the
'Fun Trunk'," came Jake's response to his wife before he turned his attention
back to the phone. "OK... um where was I."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><i><span style='color:black'>'I did not need to
hear that,'</span></i><span style='color:black'> thought Alex as he blinked at
the uncomfortably colorful commentary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I'll talk to Dia for you
Dad," reassured Alex.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Thanks kiddo," said Jake
happily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Jakey, the water's going
to get cold. And I can't reach the spot between my shoulders," came his
mother's voice again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"You know what Dad, I'll
just have Charles leave the food on the doorstep and ring the bell. Dia and I
can eat and talk at Jane's," offered Alex as he tried to keep the horrifying
images of what his parent could possibly want with hot water, baby oil and
straws away. "Know what we'll probably be there till late talking. We'll call
before we come home."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Thanks again kiddo...
woah... shiny hiney..." came Jake's response before the click indicated he had hung
up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Alex stared at the phone
for a few seconds then slowly passed it back to his friend.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"What was that all
about?" asked the freckled redhead as he slid his phone back into his breast
pocket.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Let's get the food. I'll
explain the non-emotionally scarring bits on the way," Alex replied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;background:white'><b><i><span

style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Daria shook her head at
the television as she lounged across the front end of Jane's bed. The taller
girl sat Indian style beside her friend on the bed further back and chuckled as
she switched the TV off. Both girls jumped with a start by a sudden loud
banging on the door to Jane's room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Can someone open the
door please, my hands are full," came Alex's voice from the other side of the
room's door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Lex?" inquired Daria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"No, it's Shirley
McClain. Of course it's me. Open the door!" the boy responded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"What if we're indecent
in here?" asked Jane jokingly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I promise not to peek.
Besides, you're indecent whether you're clothed or not," countered Alex.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"He's got you there,
Lane," replied Daria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Seriously!" pleaded Alex
through the door. "This Egg Drop Soup is about to become truth in advertising!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Jane leapt over Daria and
rushed to kick the rubber wedge she used to secure her door away from the
bottom edge. While it did little to actually prevent anyone from opening the
door thanks to the carpeting near the doorjamb being worn down smooth, it did
require one to have to push a bit more forcefully than usual when it was in
place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Why didn't you say you
had food?" chastised Jane as she pulled the door open to see Alex precariously
holding multiple large and heavy looking bags one each arm; all bearing the
Good Time Chinese Restaurant logo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"And a movie," added Alex
as he set the bags down and realized they all contained food. "I must have left
it downstairs with Trent. I'll be right back."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>He walked back out of
Jane's room and the sounds of his boots could be heard descending the stairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"If I had known he was
bringing dinner and a movie, I would have rolled out the red carpet for him,"
said Jane as she fished an egg roll from one of the food bags and began
devouring the fried item.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"While I'm sure he would
be quite appreciative, I don't think you could pull that off considering your
hair is black," stated Daria with a smirk as she retrieved cartons from a bag.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Jane responded by
blushing and then choking on her food as the unexpected innuendo caught her off
guard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><i><span style='color:black'>'Give, and ye shall
receive,'</span></i><span style='color:black'> thought Daria as she smirked at
being able to return the favor for the teasing she'd received regarding Trent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Alex returned, with A
Movie Shack bag and a six pack of Ultra Cola in hand, to find a teary eyed Jane
coughing profusely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"You OK," he asked
worriedly as he pulled one of the cans free and handed it to the choking girl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Jane accepted the drink,
glad that her blush could easily be dismissed as results of choking, and waved
him off the boy's concern with a gasping cough punctuated, "I'm...fine... wrong
pipe."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Next time chew before
you swallow," he teased as he plopped down on the floor across from Jane and
his sister.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Daria shifted to lean
over the front edge and began to rummage through the cartons of food. Alex slid
into a sitting position between his sister and Jane and pulled two of the
cartons from the bags out of Daria's reach as Jane recovered from her coughing
fit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I thought we were going
to try and figure out how to get out of O'Niell's latest ill-conceived
brainchild," stated Alex as he handed the boxes and one of the sealed packets
of plastic eating utensils to his twin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Daria opened one of the
cartons and smiled as the enticing smell of sweet and sour chicken wafted up
from the open carton.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Alex pulled out several
cartons for himself and smacked Jane's hand with a smirk as she tried to grab
the container of egg drop soup from him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"So what happened," he
prompted as he handed a second container of soup to the pouting room's owner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;You know how Mom
has been on this extracurricular activities kick since we attended that stupid <i>Preparing
for College</i> course?&quot; asked Daria after swallowing a mouthful of food.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Yeah," replied Alex
warily as he stirred the contents of his Styrofoam bowl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Well, she told me that
if I don't find an extracurricular activity soon, she would find one for me for
the summer," Daria advised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Oh great," said Alex.
"Dad filled me in on most of it. What is she trying to get you to sign up for
this time?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"The details aren't
really important," responded Daria. "The point is I've got to come up with an
extracurricular of my own or I can kiss any dreams of a simple, quiet, relaxed
summer goodbye."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Well, you could always
participate in Mr. O's coffee house project," suggested Jane. "It'll probably
end up getting into the paper. That should be worth enough brownie points to
keep your mom from pestering you for a while."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I knew it was going to
come back around to that somehow," complained Daria as she jammed her spork
back into the carton of white rice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Just toss one of your
more morbid poems or short horror stories his way and he'll just let you off
the hook," offered Alex as he held his bowl up and scraped the last broth
drenched mushrooms from it into his open mouth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"That would get me off
the hook with O'Neill but still wouldn't resolve the problem with Mom,"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Damn, you're right,"
agreed the boy as he picked up and opened a carton of sweet and sour chicken of
his own. "Well, guess you'll have to find something to...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Not so fast
mister,&quot; interrupted Daria. &quot;If I have to traipse down the Stupid
Brick Road, you're coming with me,"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Awwww, do I have to?"
asked Alex.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"You've got a clean bill
of health now. No more doctor visits, no more checkups or rehab sessions for
them to have to take you to," reminded Daria. "As good as that is, it also
means there is nothing to distract Mom from the fact that none of us is doing
anything 'productive' this summer. If we work on it together, we'll both be
able to get Mom off our backs about extracurricular activities... for a little
while."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Alex sighed as he
realized neither he, Daria nor Quinn were likely to be allowed to slack off
this summer if her Mother's efforts continued in the direction they had taken
that morning. At least not without something to placate her recent desire to
see them add to their potential college applications.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"True," conceded Alex
with a sigh as he stuck his own spork into a carton of rice and set it down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Besides, what kind of
big, strong brother would you be if you left your poor defenseless twin sister
all alone to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous ineptitude," added
Daria with a fluttering of her eyelashes and a pitiful but cute pout at Alex.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I swear. You share a
womb with someone one time..." complained Alex with an eye roll while Jane
laughed at her friends' antics.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;Yeah well,
brainstorm later,&quot; interjected Jane as she reached for an unclaimed bag of
steaming paper cartons. &quot;My evening of regularly scheduled lounging was
rudely interrupted with the promise of diner and a movie, and I plan on getting
both before you two head out.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;Agreed,&quot;
replied Alex as he popped open the movie case. &quot;Besides I haven't watched this
one in a while.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;Motion seconded...
motion carries,&quot; stated Daria as her brother slid the cassette into Jane's
VCR and hit the play button.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;background:white'><span
style='color:black'>

<hr size=2 width="100%" align=center>

</span></div>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"That was pretty
good,&quot; said Jane as she ejected the cassette. &quot;I was a bit worried at
first.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Why? It's one of Mike
Meyers' best movies in my opinion," remarked Alex as he and Jane rummaged
through the remaining Good Times bags for any overlooked treats.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;Come on, the
movie's title....&quot; Jane replied. &quot;It sounds like the tag line for a
spot on Sick Sad World.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;Oh man, it does,
doesn't it,&quot; remarked Alex with a chuckle. "She thought she was wedding a
lumberjack... until she found real skeletons in his closet. So I married an ax
murderer... next on Sick Sad World!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Jane laughed out loud and
Daria stifled a laugh of her own at her brother's comments before she said, "I
am of two views on the movie honestly."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"What do you mean?" asked
Jane as she frowned at an empty bag, crumpled it into a ball and tossed it
inaccurately in the general direction of her trashcan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"It's almost like two
different versions of the same movie were smashed together," explained Daria.
"The first half is the zany comedy you expect from Meyers. But the last third
seems like it's trying to be a suspense/thriller."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"There's a noticeable
tone shift," responded Alex as stretched his arms over his head. "But I think
the slapstick, over the top craziness of the last part it keeps it from feeling
totally out of place."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I liked the poetry
readings," commented Jane. "They just had that cool beatnik vibe going... despite
the fact that he was basically tearing down his exes."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"It was a rather
entertaining, as far as cathartic outlets go," added Daria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Hey Dia, Remember when
we watched it for the first time," asked Alex with a smile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Yes I do. How many
notebooks did we go through on those silly poems?" the girl asked her brother
with a small smile of her own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Too many," admitted Alex
as he batted Jane's hand away from the plastic wrapped fortune cookie he had
set beside him. "Alright, enough procrastination... We need to figure out what
we're going to do for Mr. O'Neill."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Daria's expression turned
to a frown, and then to a thoughtful half-smile again as she asked, "Hey Lex,
do we still have them?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Have what?" asked Alex
as he pointed his finger in a chastising manner at Jane who was, again tried to
purloin his fortune cookie.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"The notebooks," prompted
Daria as she tossed her own unopened fortune cookie from it to their friend.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I think so," mused Alex
aloud as he paused to think for a moment. "They should have been packed up with
your books from the old house."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>He suddenly began to
realize what his sister had in mind and smiled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"That could work
actually," continued Alex. "I'll talk to Charles at school tomorrow. I'm sure
he'd love to get in on this."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"How to make an already
unpleasant situation worse... just add Upchuck," quipped Daria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Come on Dia," said Alex.
"You know we've got a perfect opportunity..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I know, I know,"
interjected Daria. "We can do it without accompaniment. But..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"If we <b><i>have</i></b>
to do this, you know we'd both rather do it right," finished Alex.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Just keep your pal on
his leash. That's all I ask," Daria added.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Jane turned her head back
and forth between her friends as they conversed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Upchuck... accompaniment... leash...
What the hell are you two talking about?! Do I even want to know what you two
are talking about?!" demanded Jane. "I swear, when you two get into your little
zone, it's like watching someone talk on the phone, and only getting half of a
conversation."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I think I know how Lex
and I can both participate in the coffee shop project, not destroy O'Neill's
fragile psyche too much more than usual, <b><i>and</i></b> get Mom off our
backs about extracurriculars at the same time," Daria replied with a
conspiratorial smirk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span></div>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Daria and Alex entered
O'Neill's classroom about ten minutes after the last bell of the day and saw
the teacher sitting at his desk leafing through a phone book. They walked up to
the front of the desk and waited for the teacher to notice them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>After a minute of no
response, Alex cleared his throat loudly. The man looked up from the thick
phonebook a bit confused by the twins' presence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Hello... Daria and ...
Alex," said O'Neill with only a slight pause and a bright smile at being able
to remember their names without his seating chart. "What brings you to my
class?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"We wanted to talk to you
about something, sir," replied Alex.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Well, I'm always glad to
give an ear to a young person in need." said O'Neill. "Oh no! You haven't had a
lapse in your self-esteem have you?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>The man picked up the
self-esteem manual already lying on his desk with a worried expression.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"We want to volunteer to
work on the coffeehouse project," offered Daria quickly to alleviate the overly
sensitive teacher's concerns<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Fantastic!" O'Neill
exclaimed as his expression shifted again from instant worry to cheerful
enthusiasm as he focused his attention on Daria. "What made you change your
mind?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Did anyone ever make you
practice 'Pop Goes the Weasel' on the flute every day for two years?" asked the
girl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Um, no... but I once had
to recite the Gettysburg Address wearing a rainbow wig and panties that said
'Tuesday',&quot; Replied the teacher with a glance to the ceiling. "Whatever
made me want to join a fraternity?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"And that fills my
disturbing imagery quota for the week," commented Daria dryly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I could have gone my
whole life without that mental picture and been quite content," responded Alex.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>O'Neill shook himself out
of his nostalgia and continued, "Anyway, that's great! I guess you want to read
one of your essays."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Actually we were
thinking something a little more... appropriate to the setting," remarked Alex
which prompted the teacher's visage to shift yet again to concern.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>The teacher's worry was
short lived and he was almost ecstatic as Alex and Daria explained how they
planned to participate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Oh yes. I think that
will go over very well for the reopening," O'Neill said with an enthusiastic
nod.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I'm really not much for
public speaking," added Daria, in hopes of cutting off any suggestions of such
from the teacher.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Are you sure?" asked
O'Neill. "I mean don't you want to make sure that your work is properly
presented?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"That's why I'll be
giving the actual reading, sir" stated Alex.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"He's a bit more
comfortable than I am with the whole performing in public thing," stated Daria
as she placed a hand on her brother's shoulder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Well this will be an
excellent opportunity to showcase both of your talents. A 'Team Morgendorffer'
production," the teacher said with a smile and a dramatic arching wave of his
hand. "Oh yes this will work nicely."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>O'Neil looked up from
scribbling a note regarding the twins' participation and looked up to see they
were still standing at his desk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Did you need anything
else?" he asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"No sir," responded Alex as
Daria shook her head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Well if you'll excuse me
I have to make some calls about the decorations for the event," the teacher
stated as he lifted the antennae on his cell phone. "Who knew that having
banners printed could be so darned expensive?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>The twins stopped in
their departure and smiled at each other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Actually sir..."
interjected Alex as they both turned to face the teacher's desk again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"We may be able to help
with that," finished Daria as the two glanced at each other with similar
smirks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;background:white'><span

<hr size=2 width="100%" align=center>

</span></div>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"No! Not just no, but
hell no!" stated Jane fervently as she set her palette down and shook her head
at the twins. "I'm not getting dragged into this public debacle in the making."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>The two stood up and
walked around their friend's bed to stand before her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Come on," pleaded Daria.
"Do it for friendship."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I have no friends. I
walk alone," stated Jane dramatically.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Do it for school
spirit," joked Alex.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Sorry, I had that
exorcised years ago," replied Jane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Well, then, do it for
sisterhood or something," begged Daria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I've already got two
sisters. That's more than enough for me, but thanks anyway," Jane quipped as
she turned away and picked up her palette and twirled a thin paintbrush in a
glob of paint on it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"It will get you an A's
worth of test points in Literature," added Daria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I don't know..." said Jane
hesitantly, as she thought about her weak C grade point average.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"If you agree to help
with the decorations you get in for free as a member of the staff," added Alex.
"You'll have a front row seat for the train wreck without having to actually
participate like we will."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"The potential for
emotional scaring is pretty high," admitted Jane after a moment as she made a
few preliminary lines on the canvas before her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"You get to watch us
humiliate ourselves in public... in front of an audience," offered Daria with a
half smile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"The staff gets free
coffee and snacks all night," added Alex with a small smile of his own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I'm bringing a camera, a
duffel bag and my trucker's thermos," replied Jane with a grin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<hr size=2 width="100%" align=center>

</span></div>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Daria sat at the head of
her bed and read through the poetic endeavors committed to the paper within.
Alex sat Indian-style in the center of the bed and perused a notebook of his
own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>The only sounds in the
room were the turning of pages, synthesized gunfire and the occasional
grunt-splat that marked another undead dispatched as Jane played Cannibal
Fragfest on her friend's computer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"How about, 'The
Bleakness That Lies Ahead'? " asked Daria as she glanced at the title to the
first poem in the notebook.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Too sentimental,"
replied Jane from her seat in front of Daria's computer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"'Survival Guide to
Suburbia'?" suggested Alex as he leafed through a notebook of his own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Too National
Geographics," responded Jane as she ended the life of yet another digital
zombie with a click of the mouse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"&quot;Mommy's Little
Hypocrite&quot;?" suggested Daria as she flipped past some of the shorter
entries in the notebook.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Too much like a
children's book," answered Jane with a thoughtful look.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Daria slapped her notebook
closed and tossed it on the small pile of other rejected notebooks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I wish I were dead," she
stated flatly with a sigh as she rotated on the bed and leaned her back against
her brother's shoulder<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"That sounds promising,"
quipped Jane as she turned to face Daria and Alex. "Listen, you gotta give them
something they'll really appreciate. Picture Kevin and Brittany drinking in
your words like an elixir of knowledge. Heady... potent... seductive."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I thought we were doing
a poetry reading, not marketing a new fragrance of perfume," commented Daria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Oh yeah I can see it
now," said Jane as she stood up from the computer chair and grabbed two pairs
of socks from Daria's nearby clothesbasket and stuffed them into her shirt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Oh Kevy! I love the way
you smell after a long day of football practice," stated Jane as she approached
Alex with a batting of eye lashes and a bad mimic of Brittany's squeaky voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Yeah Babe," stated Alex
as he imitated Kevin's clueless expression and voice with almost frightening
accuracy. "That's because I'm the QB. Babes can't resist the QB."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Oh Kevy," continued Jane
as she put on a piteous pouting expression, complete with puppy-dog eyes. "Can
you ever forgive me for sleeping with the opposing team's running back... and the
track team... and half of the water polo team?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Alex stood up, and swung
Jane into a dramatic dipped pose reminiscent of a romance novel cover.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I could never get mad at
them... &quot; he said, blatantly looking at Jane's sock-padded chest before
returning his gaze to her face. &quot;You... I mean you. Hey what kinda QB would
I be if I couldn't forgive my babe?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Ineptitude... by Calvin
Klein" added Daria with a smile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>The three teens held
their serious expressions for about four seconds before they all broke out
laughing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Uh... should I leave you
two alone?" she asked with a raised eyebrow and a smirk as she recovered from
laughing and noticed her brother and Jane still in their dipped dramatic
position laughing with their eyes closed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>The two stopped laughing,
opened their eyes and turned to stare at Daria in confusion before they faced
each other again and realized their faces were inches from each other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>At that moment, the door
to Daria's room opened and in walked Quinn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Daria can I borrow
some..." the red head began before she caught sight of Jane in her brother's
arms, their faces precariously close.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>The heads of the room's
three occupants all turned towards Quinn, who stood still in her sister's
doorway and blinked twice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Phone," she quickly said
as she made an about face and walked back out of the room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Alex and Jane faced each
other before they straightened up and let go of each other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Alex coughed and said,
"I'll um just go head off the rumor mill before it starts grinding away what
little reputation you have."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>He then exited Daria's
room in hopes of catching his youngest sister before she started spreading
unfounded rumors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Well, that wasn't
awkward or anything," stated Jane as she flopped down on the bed next to Daria
and removed the socks from her shirt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Could have been worse,"
remarked Daria, unable to hide her amused smile. "He could have dropped you."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Oh please," responded
Jane. "That only happens in TV sitcoms and bad literature."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Speaking of bad
literature," segued the bespectacled girl. "That's exactly what we have a lot
of here."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I wouldn't say these are
bad," stated Jane as she picked up one of the discarded notebooks and skimmed
through the first poem in it. "OK, this one is pretty bad."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"None of these seems right
for the caf&eacute; opening," stated Daria dejectedly. "I'm going to have to write
something new for the occasion."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Well you better get a
move on it. The opening is this weekend," reminded Jane. "Take it from me,
O'Niell won't take 'I hit my snooze button too many times' as a legitimate
excuse."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Yeah... hmmm..." responded
Daria as her face took a thoughtful expression.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;That could
work...&quot; she added as she picked up a pencil and began writing in a fresh
notebook. "Jane you are a genius,"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Of course I am," responded
Jane smugly before her expression shifted to curious. "But just so we're
clear... why am I a genius again this time?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I'll tell you later,"
stated Daria as she moved from the bed to her computer chair and continued
writing fervently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Jane recognized when
someone had been hit in the face by their muse and decided to leave Daria to
her creative devices.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>She quietly exited
Daria's room and made her way down the hall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<hr size=2 width="100%" align=center>

</span></div>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Give it back!" came
Quinn pleaded as she jumped repeatedly in an attempt to reach the cordless
phone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I will do no such
thing," stated Alex as he held the phone above his head and well out of his
sister's reach. "The last thing Jane wants is someone running off at the mouth
about her personal life because they think they saw something."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"You two were like
totally making out! This will finally be my chance to scoop Sandi on confirming
a rumor," whined Quinn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"First things first, we
were not making out," chastised Alex. "We were goofing around trying to figure
out what we're going to do at the coffee house opening for Mr. O'Niell's
class."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Oh! Umm... Seriously, why
are you guys even bothering with that stuff?" asked Quinn. "It's not like you
need extra credit or anything."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Because, unlike you
Brat, Dia and I like to plan ahead for things." teased Alex which rewarded him
with a raspberry from Quinn. "I don't feel like spending my summer in a summer
learning program or whatever other community service idea Mom thinks will
'round out our college applications'. I'm surprised you haven't been working on
how to pad your own extracurriculars to keep Mom off your back this summer."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Alex could tell by
Quinn's suddenly wide-eyed worried expression that she hadn't even thought
about their mother's usually fanatical devotion to ensuring their every moment of
free time was spent doing something "productive".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Crap, I didn't even
think about that," swore the red head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Maybe you should spend a
little more time thinking about that, and a little less time on gossiping,"
said Alex as he handed the phone back to the girl. "And secondly, what rumor
you were going to confirm?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"You know..." stated Quinn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"If I knew, then I
wouldn't have to ask," answered Alex. "Spill it Pip."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Well... everyone's talking
about how you and Jane are, like, you know..." said Quinn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Why would they think
that?" responded Alex as he rolled his eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Well you are always
hanging with her, and like going to her house and stuff," answered Quinn. "And
she, like, slept in your bed and everything."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"For crying out loud!
Doesn't anyone have anything better to do than worry about whose dating who?"
he asked rhetorically. "We're friends. That's all. I wasn't even here when she
slept over, or did someone forget that little detail."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Quinn looked sheepishly
at her brother but didn't say anything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Even if we liked each
other that way, do really think we'd be making out in Dia's room... with Dia
there?" he asked again rhetorically.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I guess..." admitted Quinn
hesitantly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"You guess? Let me ask you
this," offered Alex, having detected Quinn's disbelief. "Would you want to kiss
your boyfriend in front of Dia? Or me, for that matter?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Ewww!" exclaimed Quinn
with a squinted disgusted expression.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"See my point? Besides,"
continued Alex. "Dia hangs out with her more than I do. Next thing you'll tell
me people think that she and Jane are an item."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Alex chuckled at his last
statement but stopped when Quinn stammered, "...umm... yeah... about that..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"You're kidding right?"
he asked, which prompted a head shake from Quinn. "And everyone calls Charles a
perv. You and your buddies need to get your minds out of the gutter. And no
confirming, denying, whatever about whoever, ok?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Just ruin all my fun why
don't you," complained Quinn with a pout.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Fun huh? How much fun
would it be if someone started a rumor about how you have the biggest crush on
Mr. Demartino?" asked Alex.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Quinn's expression
shifted from a sad pout, to disgust, then to fear for a moment before settling
into a smug smile as she dismissively said "Oh puh-lease... As if anyone would
believe something like that about moi."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Aren't these the same
people that believed I was Dia's boyfriend, and believed it when you told
everyone you were an only child despite the fact that we all have the same last
name and arrived in town at the same time?" he rebutted. "Which, by the way,
I'm still ticked at you for that only child thing."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I said I was sorry for
that already, jeez," Quinn stated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"You apologized to me,
Pip. You never told apologized to her," Alex said with a cross expression.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"She just blew me off, as
usual," whined Quinn as she turned away from her brother and crossed her arms
angrily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Well maybe if you were
half as sincere with her as you were with me, she'd actually listen to you from
time to time," answered Alex as he wrapped his arms around his sister and gave
her a squeeze.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Fine, I'll try again,"
conceded Quinn with a sigh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Good, but back on
topic..." responded Alex as he let Quinn go. "They'd believe it because, firstly,
they're gullible and more interested in embarrassing or one-upping you than
knowing the truth...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;True,&quot;
acknowledged Quinn thoughtfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;Scondly, and most
importantly, I'm your brother,&quot; he concluded. &quot;They'd consider me a
reliable source. I mean, why would I make something like <b><i>that</i></b>,
up.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;Ohmygod!&quot;
Quinn squeaked. &quot;You wouldn't do that? Please don't do that. It would like
totally ruin my popularity.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;Calm down
Pip,&quot; soothed Alex. &quot;I'm not saying I would do that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><i><span style='color:black'>'Though Dia might if
you ticked her off enough,'</span></i><span style='color:black'> came his
mental addendum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;Just trying to make
a point. What you say about us and the people we associate with carries a lot
of weight because you <b><i>are</i></b> popular and you <b><i>are</i></b> our
sister,&quot; he continued.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;I didn't think
about that,&quot; admitted the red head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;And remember it
goes the other way as well. Dia and I may not be popular, but because you're
our sister, people will believe what we say about you.&quot; he stated with a
conspiratorial smirk. &quot;So please, no more spreading gossip about me, Dia,
Jane, Dia and Jane, Jane and I, or any other crazy combination thereof.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Fine," agreed Quinn
begrudgingly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Or at least take the
time to get your facts straight before hand, OK?" he requested as he playfully
bopped her on the head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"OK, you big meanie
head," stated Quinn as she punched him playfully in the arm and followed it up
with a hug. &quot;Sorry.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Yeah, yeah," teased Alex
as he returned the hug then moved to leave. &quot;Apology accepted Brat.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>When he exited the room,
Alex saw Jane leaned against the wall beside the door with her arms crossed,
smiling lightly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"So, everything taken
care of with the Countess of Rumorville?" Jane asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"As well as can be
expected," answered Alex with a sigh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Anyway, Daria appears to
have been bitten by the writing bug so I'm going to head home," announced Jane as
she pushed off of the wall and headed to the stairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"It's pretty late,"
stated Alex as he glanced at his wristwatch while he followed the girl down the
steps. "I'll walk you home," Alex<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Naaa," declined Jane.
"I'll be fine. Besides wont Daria need your help finishing the piece she's
working on?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I'll probably have to
proof it later, but that will be after she has it mostly finished," he replied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Ahh gotcha," replied
Jane as they approached the front door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Anyway, I insist...
Years of matriarchal conditioning won't let me accept your declination. It is
my pleasure, nay, my duty to ensure you return to your most auspicious abode
safely," the boy continued as he opened the front door for Jane and gestured,
as dramatically as he had spoken, for her to proceed. "After you m'lady."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"You've been hanging
around Upchuck for way too long, pal," said Jane with a small chuckle as she
exited the house. "But since I apparently have no say so in the matter, I guess
I'll allow you the privilege of escorting me."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Alex locked the door
behind them and the two began to make their way towards Howard Drive. They
walked at an unhurried and leisurely pace. They discussed the decorations Jane
had been commissioned to finish, Alex's plans for his portion of the
performance and other random topics. Before long they stood on the sidewalk in
front of Casa de Lane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"So it'll be Charles and
I definitely. Maybe Stan, since he's also in Mr. O'Niell's lit class with us,"
stated Alex.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Who," asked Jane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Stan Mooreston,"
responded Alex. "Sits a few rows back from us in O'Niell's class. He's in Mr.
Johansen's class with Charles and I,... plays the saxophone."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Cool. So you kids gonna
stop by tomorrow after school and check out the banners," asked Jane as the
pair walked up the front walkway of<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Well I might not,
depending on how far Dia gets with the actual writing,&quot; Alex remarked. "I
still have to work out the accompaniment with Charles and make sure we can pull
it off without sounding too bad."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Oh yeah, good luck
keeping Daria from beating him into a senseless pile of goo... well more of a
senseless pile than he already is anyway," responded Jane. &quot;Speaking of
senseless piles, Max agreed to give you guys a hand.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;Cool,&quot; replied
Alex with a smile. &quot;How'd you convince him to help?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;Oh, a little
flattery here, bribery there, a touch of ear twisting on the side,&quot;
answered Jane. &quot;Plus, Trent managed to convince him that it would be good
exposure for 'The Spiral'.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Nice, and for the record
Charles promised me that he'd be on his best behavior," stated Alex with a
shrug. "Hopefully we can make it through without him having to have Dia's boots
surgically removed from a very uncomfortable place."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"If not, we could always
film the ensuing slaughter and turn that into O'Niell. "We could call it a
performance piece depicting the battle of the sexes," quipped Jane. "Even if
O'Niell doesn't like it, it would pull in a few extra credit points from
Barch."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"It's always good to have
a backup plan," deadpanned Alex as they reached the front door. "Well here you
are, safely delivered home."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I would have been fine
you know,&quot; said Jane casually with a smile. &quot;But I appreciate the
thought.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"What are friends for?
Besides, it's the least I can do for almost tarnishing your sterling
reputation," he joked as Jane leaned against the inside of the doorway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Please..." dismissed Jane
with a hand flip. "If my reputation were sterling, I'd have pawned it ages ago.
Besides, I told you guys before, I like the tarnish on my image. It adds a
touch of color."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>&quot;I know, I
know,&quot; replied Alex. &quot;Still...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I appreciated
sentiment," said Jane as she gave him one last smile before turning back into
the house. &quot;Night amigo.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Buenas noches amiga,"
replied Alex with a wave as he headed back up the walkway and walked home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;background:white'><span

<hr size=2 width="100%" align=center>

</span></div>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"That was a most...
emotional reading from Garret," said Mr. O'Niell worriedly as a scruffy
20-something man with the broken neck of an acoustic guitar clenched in his
hand, walked angrily from the slightly raised dais in the center of the caf&eacute;
that served as a stage for the evening's performers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>As a member of the
cleaning crew swept the remains of the former instrument, Daria and Alex
smirked at their teacher from their seats in the back of the newly christened <b><i>Caf&eacute;
Lawndale. </i></b><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Around them, was gathered
a decent size crowd. Patrons of the newly opened shop milled around the large
open room. Most sat at low circular tables scattered evenly through the center
section before the stage. Others, like the twins, sat at more elevated
half-circular tables against the walls on cushioned stools. A few even lounged
on over-large beanbag chairs sprinkled sparsely throughout the place. Almost
everyone had a cup, mug or bowl filled with some variety of coffee-based
beverage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"It's not as bad as I
thought it would be," commented Daria as she slowly glanced around the dimly
lit room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I have to admit, they
did a good job with the place," agreed Alex as he similarly surveyed the room.
"Jane's banners turned out great."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Daria glanced up at two
large cloth banner that hung over the brightly lit stage which bore <b>'Welcome
to Caf&eacute; Lawndale!' </b>and <b>'Open Mic Night'</b> in bold yellow on colorful
star and planet bedecked dark backgrounds. Daria noted the other smaller
versions of the two banners draped in lit sections along the wall and main
counter of the coffee shop.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"If I hadn't watched her
while she was working on them, I would have guessed Mr. O'Niell had them
professionally printed," confirmed Daria with an honest smile at her friend's
talent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Speak of the devil,"
commented Alex as he noticed the young artist approaching their table.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Hola amigos," mumbled
Jane around a large oatmeal raisin cookie as she approached the twins table.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Hola Juanita. &#191;C&oacute;mo
est&aacute;n esta noche?" returned Daria flatly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"&#191;Qu&eacute; haces, chica?"
prompted Alex.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Yeah... uh... you know I
don't actually speak Spanish right?" replied Jane as she removed the large
cookie from her mouth and set her oversized mug of steaming coffee and several
bags of snack food onto the table.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Really? We kind of
assumed..." began Daria with a surprised expression.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"...with the whole 'Hola
amigos' thing..." added Alex equally surprised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Oh, that. Just something
I picked up from Penny after she came back from her first trip south of the
border," explained Jane as she tossed the snack bags into a duffel bag
underneath the twins' table. "She was gone for a year or so, and when she came
back, that's how she would answer the phone when her friends called."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Where did you guys pick
it up?" asked Jane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"You can't spend the
first half of your life in southern Texas without being able to speak Spanish,"
answered Alex.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I'm here. But where are
you?" stated Andrea as she read from a tattered notebook before the mic. "Sure,
I see your body. Anybody home in that rotting bag of flesh??<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>She walked off the stage
as the crowd clapped politely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"That was a confidence
inspiring response," stated Daria sarcastically.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"This may not be a poetry
crowd," remarked Jane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"You think it's too late
for me to learn how to juggle?" asked Alex.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Probably," answered
Jane. "Although if you missed and hit a few spectators you'd probably get as
much applause as Brittany did for booting Kevin off the stage."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Mr. O'Neill took the
stage again as Andrea stepped down and returned to a front row table with
several of the other Goth's of Lawndale High<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Thank you very much,
Andrea. It takes a lot of courage to expose your raw emotions that way," stated
O'Niell nervously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>A spotlight shined on
Andrea's table. The girl could be seen drinking from a bottle wrapped in a
plain brown paper bag. She coughed once in surprise and quickly moved the
bottle behind her out of sight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"And, speaking of raw
emotions," the teacher continued. "It's my pleasure to introduce one of
Lawndale High's most gifted students: Alexander Morgendorffer."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Thanks Mr. O'Niell,"
returned Alex nervously as he took the microphone from the older man and slid
it back into its holder on the stand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>As the boy thanked his
teacher, several others took the stage and took their places at the various
instruments that had been occupying the stage unused for the majority of the
evening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Tonight I'd like to
perform a bit of poetry written by my ever-so talented sister, Daria," stated
Alex with an extended arm pointed towards Daria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>The spotlight swung in
the direction he pointed, to illuminate the small table where Daria and Jane
sat. Daria blinked a few times as the bright light shone in her face and gave a
nervous wave.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"This is a little piece
called 'Lawndale Blues'," he announced as Charles began to strum out a
mid-paced rhythm on his Double Bass.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>The sound of a saxophone
and Max's drumming joined the low strumming to create a simple jazzy tune. Alex
took several deep breaths to soothe his nerves before he leaned into the mic
and began.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><b><span style='color:black'>Lawndale...

few times before he turned to look at his accompaniment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Stanley and Charles
appeared to be equally surprised by the positive response of the crowd and
shrugged at the Alex.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Max simply slid his
drumsticks into a back pocket and headed towards the steps of the stage. On his
way down he stopped next to Alex and said, "Not bad kid."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Alex glanced around the
dimly lit room and his eyes lit upon his sister and Jane's table.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Jane was hooting and
clapping as loudly as the rest of the audience while Daria merely sat with her
arms crossed before her, and a neutral expression.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Alex raised his eyebrow
at his sister. Daria's expression shifted into a wide smile rarely seen in
public. She raised her hands to either side of her head and began snapping her
fingers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Alex returned his

table Monday morning with his children and read casually from the news paper.
Alex and Daria flanked their father and ate from large bowls of cereal while
Quinn sat beside her brother with a yogurt cup and a few slices of melon on a

coffeehouse you were working for?" asked Jake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Yeah, we had that
presentation for Mr. O'Niell's class," answered Daria as she moved to look over
her father's other shoulder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"'The Lawndale High
administration is very happy with the community response to Lawndale's new
young adult coffeehouse after its opening night'," Jake continued to read. "'<i>We're
just so proud to have so many talented young people who are ready and willing
to put their talents towards this project</i>, commented Timothy O'Niell.
O'Niell is an English Teacher at Lawndale High and the organizer of the effort
to rebuild and reopen the Caf&eacute; after the unfortunate break-in that threatened
to close the business down'."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Helen walked into the
kitchen with her briefcase in one hand, cell phone clutched between her
shoulder and ear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Early meeting at the
Royalton," she announced. "No time for breakfast."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"But you haven't even
tasted my Cr&ecirc;pe Suzettes yet," deadpanned Daria.

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"We're having Cr&ecirc;pe Suzettes?"
asked Jake enthusiastically, distracted from the article.

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"No Dad, we're not
having Cr&ecirc;pe Suzettes," answered Alex with a smirk as Daria and Quinn rolled
their eyes at their father's gullibility.

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Aww man," responded Jake dejectedly.

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"What's the rest of the article say," prompted Daria.

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Oh right," said Jake as
he resumed reading the newspaper aloud. "The highlight of the evening was a
particularly spirited reading of poetry written specifically for the occasion
by Daria Morgendorffer, a sophomore at Lawndale High'."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"What?!" asked Helen and
Quinn in unison.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Quinn hopped up from her
seat and crowded in beside her brother and father. Helen stopped in the kitchen
doorway and turned back towards her husband and children with a surprised
expression.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"'The poem was presented
with musical accompaniment provided by Max Tyler, drummer for local rock troupe
Mystik Spiral, and fellow Lawndale High sophomores Stanley Mooreston and
Charles Rutheimer III'," continued Jake. "Hey isn't that the band you guys are
always going to see with Jane-O?"

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Cool. They managed to sneak in a plug for
the band," said Alex.

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"'The poem itself was recited by another Lawndale
sophomore, Alexander Morgendorffer; the author's brother. The group wowed the
Caf&eacute; Lawndale crowd with their spoken word performance, which was pleasantly
appropriate for the venue in this reporter's opinion.' Wow, that's great kids!"
exclaimed Jake as Helen crossed the kitchen and took the paper from her beaming
husband.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"'Timothy O'Niell went on
to say <i>Daria is such an impressive writer that I knew her contribution would
be emotionally powerful</i>'," read Helen aloud. "'<i>Teens are impressionable,
and it does this educator's heart good to see young people like the
Morgendorffer twins and their classmates taking an active role in their
community's well-being</i>'."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>She blinked a few times
and glanced back and forth between her eldest children before she inquired.
"Quinn did you know about this?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Well duh, Mom," replied
the red head off-handedly. "They've only been talking about it, and practicing
it with Jane and Upchuck for, like, the past three weeks."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Helen blinked and examined
the article again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Why aren't you mentioned
Quinn?" asked Helen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"um... I had a date that
night," replied the red head off-handedly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Helen placed her fists on
her hips and stated "Well that's no excuse..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"It was a project for Mr.
O'Niell's <b><i>sophomore</i></b> class," interrupted Daria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Remember, Quinn's just a
freshman, Mom. She's not in our class," Alex added.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Besides," continued
Daria. "It was little more than a glorified music and writing exercise..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Which are our spheres of
influence, not Quinn's" added Alex. "I doubt she would have enjoyed working on
it even if she had anything to contribute to the project."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Yeah, that whole
coffeehouse thing is like, so totally retro," Quinn commented aloud with a
silently mouthed 'Thank you' in her siblings' direction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Not to mention it wasn't
our idea to participate in the first place," continued Alex.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"It definitely had the
initial earmarks of one of Mr. O'Niel's educational disasters in the making,"
stated Daria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Well you two definitely
made lemonade out of lemons," praised Jake as he stood and walked over to the
kitchen counter and retrieved a pair of scissors from a drawer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Just remember, you have
to be careful what you let people talk you into," the man added as he carefully
clipped the article from the paper and hung it prominently on the refrigerator
with a frog shaped magnet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Yes, we've got to
maintain constant vigilance against those who'd force or manipulate us into
taking actions or participate in activities we'd never agree to on our own,"
commented Daria snidely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I'll say!" agreed Jake
reflexively as he stepped back and looked at the clipping one more time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Helen paused for moment
at the comment, but immediately continued on her way out of the kitchen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><i><span style='color:black'>'Ouch,' </span></i><span
style='color:black'>though Alex and Quinn as they noticed their mother's brief
pause as she left.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<hr size=2 width="100%" align=center>

</span></div>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Jake reclined against the
headboard on his side of the bed in his pajamas. He read quietly from a cooking
magazine by the light of the nightstand lamp.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>The sounds of the faucet
quieted and Helen exited the bathroom wearing a mid thigh satin nightgown. She
climbed into bed slid under the covers, reclined similarly to her husband.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Jake?" Helen asked
quietly after several minutes of silent contemplation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Yeah honey?" responded
Jake without looking up from his magazine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Do you think I'm too
hard on the kids?" Helen asked hesitantly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"What do you mean?" he
responded as he licked his thumb and turned the page.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I don't know. It's like
every time I try to get them involved in something that will help them in the
long run, it always ends the same," continued Helen as she scooted to a more
comfortable sitting position with her back to the headboard. "We have the same
argument, over and over again, and when it's all said and done, I end up
looking like the bad guy."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><i><span style='color:black'>'Especially with
Daria,</span></i><span style='color:black'>'she added mentally.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I don't think you're
being hard on them," answered Jake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Helen smiled at her
husband's comment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"But I still think it
would be a good idea to ease up on this extracurricular push you're on honey,"
continued Jake, which caused Helen's smile to fade. "You have to look at it
from their side. The kids have been through a lot."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><i><span style='color:black'>'Especially Alex and
Daria,' </span></i><span style='color:black'>thought Jake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I know Jake. I know,"
said Helen tiredly. "We all have. I just want them to get past it. I want them
to start thinking about their futures. Their <b>individual </b>futures..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Helen..." said Jake in a
chastising manner as he closed his book and set it on the nightstand beside the
bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I'm sorry Jake, but I
just don't like how clingy they are with each other," remarked Helen with a
cross of her arms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Helen, they're twins.
They've been together, literally, since the moment they were conceived,"
replied Jake, as small amount of his frustration managed to creep into his
voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Jake closed his eyes and
took a deep, calming breath before continuing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Do you remember in the
hospital, when they were born?" he asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"God do I. They would
both scream bloody murder if you tried to separate them. The nurses learned
pretty quickly to put them in the same basinet in the nursery if they wanted to
get the other babies to sleep," she responded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Her stern expression
softened at the memory of standing beside Jake watching Alex and Daria sleeping
side by side in the Hospital nursery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Remember, after they
started walking?" Jake continued.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>His mouth turned up at
the corners into a goofy grin as he remembered the twins, no more than 4 or 5
years old, running through the front yard of their tiny house in Highland,
holding hands the way they always did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I swear, you would have
thought their hands we glued together," recalled Helen with a light chuckle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"That's what I'm talking
about honey," continued Jake, as he roused himself from his nostalgia. "You
always talk about wanting to 'bond with the girls', and about how I should
'bond with Alex'... But those two have a bond that neither of us could even dream
of."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I know, Jake," replied
Helen quietly as she leaned her head against her husband's shoulder. "It's not
that I don't like how close they are. I don't like not understanding it."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I don't get it all the
time either, honey," said Jake as he reached his arm over and around his wife's
shoulder and kissed her forehead. "But that doesn't make it a bad thing."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"I guess I am making too
much of it," Helen admitted hesitantly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Maybe a little," agreed
Jake with a grin and a wink which rewarded him with a playful smack on the
chest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>"Besides, neither of us
has the best track record where our own siblings are concerned," Jake said as
he set his magazine down on the nightstand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>He scooted further under
the covers before he again pulled Helen close to him. The two lay like that for
several quiet minutes, with Helen snuggled against her husband.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>Jake smiled as he felt
Helen fully relax and drift off to sleep with her arms around him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><i><span style='color:black'>'I think us not
completely understanding how they can be so close, is a good thing,</span></i><span
style='color:black'>' he thought as he carefully switched off the nightstand
light and fell asleep in his wife's arms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
