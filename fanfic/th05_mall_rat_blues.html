<p><b>Chapter 5 &ndash; Mall Rat Blues</b></p>

<p>"Good grief," stated Jane as she closed the front door of her house behind her.
"I'm not the biggest fan of air-headed perky model types but that was pretty
bad, even for an air headed perky model type."</p>

<p>"Well, you can be certain that no one will ever mistake Kathy Ireland for an
actress again after that one," commented Alex as he handed his sister her green
jacket.</p>

<p>"And I thought Brittany was bad," added Daria as she donned her jacket with
a smile to her brother. "I don't remember her being quite so... squeaky."</p>

<p>Jane laughed and stated, "Best part was when that Charmin guy actually
stopped her in the middle of her desperate plea for help to ask <i>'Is that
really your voice?'</i>"</p>

<p>Alex chuckled and Daria gave a noticeable smile at the scene as they headed
down the street. The three continued discussing the merits of the abysmal movie
they had just watched as they walked to the Morgendorffer home.</p>

<p>"I wonder what Mom's making for dinner," mused Alex aloud.</p>

<p>"Time to feed the beast it seems," teased Daria. "Maybe, if we're lucky,
there will be enough for the rest of the family this time."</p>

<p>"Ha ha," said Alex with a roll of his eyes. "And who ate an entire large
carnivore special by herself last night?"</p>

<p>"I left some of the crust on mine, unlike some people," rebutted Daria with
a smirk towards her brother before she glanced at Jane. "At least we only ate <b><i>one</i></b>
each."</p>

<p>"Hey, you two don't have to compete with the mooching machine that is The
Spiral on a regular basis," said Jane offhandedly. "It was either eat it all
then or chance not having anything to eat later. I went with the sure
thing&quot;</p>

<p>Alex and Daria glanced at each other briefly. The three walked in silence
that bordered on becoming awkward.</p>

<p>"$10 says its lasagna... again," remarked Daria in answer to her brother's
prior musing.</p>

<p>"Even Vegas would frown at the odds on that bet, Dia," replied Alex with a
smirk as the three came to a stop before the Morgendorffer home.</p>

<p>"You know you're welcome to stay for dinner Jane," offered Daria as they
made their way up the front walkway.</p>

<p>"We've got enough frozen lasagna stockpiled to last the winter," added Alex
as he unlocked and opened the front door. "I'm sure the folks wouldn't mind."</p>

<p>"A hundred miles... To go to a mall?! Dammit! There's a mall five minutes
away!" came Jake's exasperated voice from within the house.</p>

<p>The twins glanced at each other and said in unison, "Quinn."</p>

<p>"Even if we can't promise you dinner, looks like you might get a show,"
deadpanned Daria.</p>

<p>"I'll take a rain check amigos," declined Jane with a smile as she headed
away from the house and towards her own. "One bad drama for the night is my limit."</p>

<p>The twins shrugged at each other, entered the house and made their way into
the kitchen.</p>

<p>" It's too far away, Quinn," came Helen's voice as the twins entered the
kitchen and made their way to their usual seats at the table.</p>

<p>"Hi kids," greeted Helen before she returned her attention to her youngest
child. "Besides, you've done more than enough shopping for this quarter."</p>

<p>"Muh-om," whined Quinn. "As vice president of the Fashion Club, I need to
know what's out there!"</p>

<p>"Vice president," asked Jake as his expression perked up. "Did you know she
was vice president, Helen?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Jake," responded Helen.</p>

<p>"Of the Fashion Club!" he continued proudly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Jake," confirmed Helen tiredly. "Vice president of the Fashion Club."</p>

<p>"Do you think this tie works?" Jake asked worriedly as he held his red
necktie out for his youngest daughter's inspection.</p>

<p>"Hmmm," vocalized Quinn as she held and examined the tie.</p>

<p>Jake tried with much effort not to fidget as he waited for Quinn's response.</p>

<p>"It's nice, Daddy," the red-head answered after a few seconds of
deliberation. "But I think a mandarin collar would really set off your strong
jaw line."</p>

<p>"Really," asked Jake as with a smile before his brow furrowed and he looked
at his wife. "What's a mandarin collar?"</p>

<p>"I'd be happy to show you several styles that would really work for you
Daddy," replied Quinn. "Now, if you drive me to the Mall of the Millennium..."</p>

<p>"No more malls until you bring up your grade point average," interjected
Helen.</p>

<p>"Exactly!" exclaimed Jake towards Quinn before he turned again to Helen.
"What's wrong with her grade point average?"</p>

<p>"I'm not exactly thrilled with her mid-term report card," she answered
before rising and moving to the oven. "A few too many C's for my liking."</p>

<p>"But Muh-oom," whined Quinn. "Sandi and the other girls are going. How will
I hold my head up in the Fashion Club if I can't go?"</p>

<p>"You could try a neck brace," quipped Alex.</p>

<p>"Or a traction pulley," added Daria.</p>

<p>"Yeah but the ropes would clash with her winter wardrobe," commented Alex.</p>

<p>"And we just can't have that now can we," said Daria.</p>

<p>"Just because you two aren't interested in what's new and attractive and
popular..." began Quinn in a haughty tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, we're interested," replied Daria. "But why go a mere 100 miles away?"</p>

<p>"I hear that new Mega Mall in California is amazing," added Alex.</p>

<p>"California?" inquired Jake nervously.</p>

<p>"And there are some fascinating malls in Southeast Asia," commented Daria.</p>

<p>"Southeast Asia? To go to a mall? Dammit!" exclaimed Jake angrily.</p>

<p>"Sit down, dear. It was a joke," soothed Helen with a glare at her oldest
children as she donned a pair of oven mitts and opened the oven.</p>

<p>"Ohhhhh," said Jake as he visibly calmed. "Good one kids."</p>

<p>Helen returned from the oven and shook her head at her husband.</p>

<p>"I don't care what the other girls are doing, young lady. But you are not
doing any more shopping until we see some improvement in your grades," she
stated with finality.</p>

<p>With that statement, Helen set the large rectangular metal dish of now hot
lasagna in the center of the table and took her seat beside Jake.</p>

<p>Quinn crossed her arms and fumed silently. She knew better than to argue
with her mother this time.</p>

<p>Daria looked at the lasagna, then shot her Mona Lisa smile to her brother.</p>

<p>"Worse odds than Vegas," commented the boy quietly.</p>

<p>"What was that dear," asked Helen as she began to cut and plate square
chunks of steaming lasagna.</p>

<p>"Nothing Mom," answered Alex as he returned his sister's small smile and
reached for a plate.</p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>

<hr size=1 width="100%" noshade color=gray align=center>

</div>

<p>"So my mom was, like, 'No more shopping until you bring your grades up young
lady'," complained Quinn as she and the other Fashion Club members strolled
down the halls of Lawndale High.</p>

<p>"That's... sooooo unfair," drawled Tiffany.</p>

<p>"I know," Quinn agreed. "It's like she expects me to be a brain like Daria
and Lex."</p>

<p>"My Mom totally went through the roof after our last shopping trip," added
Stacy. "She told me I can't buy any more clothes until the weather changes."</p>

<p>"Bummer," stated Tiffany sadly.</p>

<p>"Well, I am just glad that <i>my </i>mother is not as fashion challenged,"
interjected Sandi as the group came to a halt outside of their shared class. "I
was just about to motion for an official Fashion Club outing to review the
shopping potential of the new mall. However, it looks like we will have to
postpone that until such time as some of our <i>less fortunate</i> members..."</p>

<p>"MISS GRIFFIN!" came a loud voice from the open classroom doorway which cut
off the remainder of Sandi's statement.</p>

<p>The four girls turned their attention to the voice's owner, one Anthony
DeMartino, with sheepish expressions.</p>

<p>Mr. DeMartino stood in the doorway of his classroom and glared unevenly
(mostly due to what appeared to be an uncontrollable twitching of his enlarged
right eye) at the girls before he loudly ranted, "I feel I must APOLOGIZE for
interrupting whatever FASCINATING shade of LIP gloss or flower BARETTES you
were discussing with you COHORTS with such a trivial thing like your SCHEDULED
history lesson but unlike you, I would like to make the ATTEMPT at a moderately
productive class today."</p>

<p>With that statement he turned and reentered his classroom.</p>

<p>"Maybe we should wait until lunch to talk about this," suggested Quinn which
elicited nods from Stacy and Tiffany.</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Sandi. "Discussion tabled until a more convenient time."</p>

<p>"To-DAY ladies," barked DeMartino from his place at his desk.</p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>

<hr size=1 width="100%" noshade color=gray align=center>

</div>

<p>The majority of students in Mrs. Bennett's classroom scratched their heads
in confusion as the teacher scrawled even more incomprehensible markings into
the patterns on the chalkboard.</p>

<p>"In economics, we call this flow," stated the middle-aged female teacher as
she pointed to seemingly random circles and squiggles in her chart. "We have a
scenario of supply and demand, where a new demand is created by a previous supply."</p>

<p>Alex blinked repeatedly as he attempted to make sense of the diagram the
teacher had worked out on the chalkboard.</p>

<p>"Is it just me or do you need a degree in non-Euclidean geometry to even
begin understanding her diagrams," asked Daria quietly.</p>

<p>"I don't think even that would help," he responded</p>

<p>The boy turned to make a joke to Jane when he noticed her scribbling
furiously in her notebook.</p>

<p>"Wait... are you actually taking notes?" he asked incredulously.</p>

<p>"Huh... notes? What are you smoking?" asked Jane before she realized why Alex
had asked the question. "Oooooh... I wanted to try and copy that pattern."</p>

<p>She held up her notebook to him, which showed a more esthetically pleasing
version of the complex collection of squares, circles and lines covering the front
chalkboard.</p>

<p>"I'm almost sure I can reproduce it in 3-dimentional sculpture... though I
might have to stretch that 3rd dimension a little bit."</p>

<p>&quot;Does everyone follow?&quot; asked Mrs. Bennet as she turned to face
the class. Her slightly pudgy face bore an excited but restrained smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Can anyone give me a concrete representation of this abstract
theory?&quot; She continued with expectant glances around the room.</p>

<p>After a long, silent pause in which no one volunteered an answer, the woman gave
a small sigh then turned to the front middle seats of her classroom.</p>

<p>&quot;Alexander? Daria?&quot; she prompted hopefully.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Mrs Bennett,&quot; Daria began. &quot;If we're talking
concrete... I'd have to go with that ever so popular repository of human greed
and debasement more commonly known as 'the mall'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very good,&quot; the teacher responded. &quot;The mall is a very
beautiful illustration of all these economic principles. In fact, it would make
for an excellent field trip.&quot;</p>

<p>"All right! Field trip!" shouted Kevin as he pumped his fist in the air
several times.</p>

<p>He settled down and a brief look of confusion crossed his face. He then
leaned forward and tapped Alex on the shoulder to get his attention.</p>

<p>"Hey, where are we going, man?" the quarterback asked.</p>

<p>"Let's see... we're talking about supply and demand... then Ms Bennett said that
the mall is a perfect example... where do you think we're going?" responded Alex.</p>

<p>"uh..." mused Kevin, clueless as usual.</p>

<p>"It's a field trip Kevin," interjected Daria. "We're going to the field."</p>

<p>"Oh," stated Kevin acceptingly before his goofy grin returned. "Cool."</p>

<p>Alex simply shook his head and glanced toward Jane. Jane chuckled lightly
and returned her attention to her notepad.</p>

<p>"In fact," continued Mrs. Bennett. "The brand new Mall of the Millennium gives
us an excellent example. It's a perfect emblem of a modern day economic
structure."</p>

<p>While the majority of the class perked up at the mention of the new mall,
Daria gave an almost imperceptible frown.</p>

<p>"Um, Mrs. Bennett," Daria called.</p>

<p>"Yes dear. What is it?" the teacher responded.</p>

<p>"I think that's a really bad idea," said Daria with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, Daria," responded Mrs. Bennett. "It's your idea and it's
perfect."</p>

<p>"We'll take a vote," the woman offered. "All in favor of a class trip to the
mall next Friday instead of our usual surprise quiz?"</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, almost every hand in the classroom went up, accompanied by
a few cheers from Kevin and several of the other football players. Daria
glanced around and her eyebrow rose when she noticed that in addition to Jane,
her brother had also raised his hand.</p>

<p>"All opposed?" asked the teacher after everyone in favor of the trip had
lowered their hands.</p>

<p>Daria immediately raised her hand. She looked around and realized hers was
the only hand up.</p>

<p>With a sigh she lowered her hand and stated, "Objection withdrawn."</p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>

<hr size=1 width="100%" noshade color=gray align=center>

</div>

<p>Alex, Daria and Jane walked to an empty table in the far corner of the lunch
room and set their trays down.</p>

<p>"So we're going to learn how to make pasta in Home Ec today," stated Jane as
she took a spot beside Alex and across from Daria.</p>

<p>"Hopefully the same person who made today's Spaghetti Surprise isn't
teaching the class," remarked Alex as he poked hesitantly at the blob of
overcooked, and clumpy noodles underneath a pathetically thin red sauce which
rested in the middle of his tray.</p>

<p>"Well if the food doesn't suit your tastes I'll be happy to take it off your
hands," remarked Jane as she hooked a finger on the corner of his plate and
began to slowly slide it towards her own tray.</p>

<p>The tray stopped moving as Alex set a hand on the opposite side of his tray
and waved his fork at Jane in a faux threat.</p>

<p>The two continued to talk briefly about pasta and the poor quality of the
lunchroom food, between bites of said food before Alex focused his attention on
his sister.</p>

<p>Daria was weakly poking at the food on her plate with her typical neutral
expression. The casual observer wouldn't have thought anything of it. Alex
however could tell something was bothering the girl.</p>

<p>"You OK Dia," he asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah, you've barely touched your Spaghetti Surprise," observed Jane. "Not
that I can blame you. It's only moderately edible today."</p>

<p>"Why do they call it Spaghetti Surprise?" asked Alex.</p>

<p>"Because it would be a surprise if there were anything resembling actual
spaghetti in it," deadpanned Daria.</p>

<p>"Come on Dia, what's bugging you," prompted Alex. "... aside from the food of
course."</p>

<p>Daria pushed her tray away from her and gave a sigh.</p>

<p>"It's bad enough that Mom keeps dragging me out on shopping trips," she
began. "But now I have to get dragged to the &Uuml;ber-Mall by the school."</p>

<p>"Yeah Mom's little bonding trips are pretty mind numbing," agreed Alex. "And
that's on a good day."</p>

<p>"So why'd you vote for the trip?" Daria asked.</p>

<p>"Because it beats sitting around Mrs. Bennett's classroom getting eyestrain
and a migraine trying to decipher another one of her charts," replied Alex.</p>

<p>"What about you," ask Daria with a glance in Jane's direction.</p>

<p>"An opportunity to skip a pop quiz, wander aimlessly in the mall... <b><i>and </i></b>not
only get class credit for it but avoid a bunch of classes for the day," stated
Jane after swallowing her mouthful of food. "Now that's a school activity I can
support."</p>

<p>"Fair enough," returned Daria after a moment of thought. "Still... I am not
looking forward to being stuck in the mall with our illustrious peers for the
whole day."</p>

<p>"It can't be any worse than being stuck in the mall with Mom and Quinn all
day," offered Alex. "At least I won't have to carry purses and shopping bags
this time around."</p>

<p>"Darn, I was looking forward to having my own pack mule for the trip,"
teased Jane.</p>

<p>"If Quinn were coming with us, I'd say borrow one of hers," joked Alex.</p>

<p>"<b><i>If </i></b>Quinn were coming with us, she'd probably need more than
the three she has," quipped Daria before she pulled her tray back towards
herself and took a bite of Spaghetti Surprise.</p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>

<hr size=1 width="100%" noshade color=gray align=center>

</div>

<p>The bulk of the sophomore class stood in the parking lot of Lawndale High.
The lot was filled with sounds of the mass of gathered teens chit-chatting and
generally milling about. Jane, Daria and Alex stood near the front of the crowd
and carried on a casual conversation with Jodie and Mack.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett stepped casually through the throng of students and stood near
the doors of the bus.</p>

<p>"Alright everyone when I call your name..." the teacher began before realizing
that the majority of the gathered teens weren't paying attention to her.</p>

<p>She tried to gain their attention several more times with no success.</p>

<p>"I got this," stated Jane as she reached into her jacket pocket and fished
out a metal whistle.</p>

<p>"Mack if you would be so kind," she requested as she brought the whistle to
her lips.</p>

<p>The football captain shook his head and placed a firm grip on his
quarterback's padded shoulder.</p>

<p>"What the..." started Daria before Jane took a deep breath and blew forcefully
into the whistle.</p>

<p>Mack dug his feet in as he held Kevin, who had almost bolted towards the
field mid sentence due to what could only be an autonomic response to the sound
of the whistle.</p>

<p>The shrill sound had a more normal affect on the rest of the crowd. All
conversation stopped and everyone faced forward</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett beamed a smile at Jane as she began to call off the student's
names and herd them into the busses.</p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>

<hr size=1 width="100%" noshade color=gray align=center>

</div>

<p>The buses pulled away from LHS and made their way to the freeway. The
student's settled into their seats and resumed their conversations while Mrs.
Bennett stood at the front near the driver. The teacher gave a brief lecture
about the fundamentals of the retail consumer market while the chatting teens
largely ignored her.</p>

<p>"So Mr. Ruttheimer," prompted Alex to his freckled friend seated beside him.
"What's the plan?"</p>

<p>"Well Mr. Morgendorffer, I plan to explore the advantages of a gold card,"
Charles replied as, with brief demonstration of sleight of hand, he produced a
glittery gold credit card.</p>

<p>He then turned around on his knees to the seat behind them and addressed
Daria and Jane.</p>

<p>"Of course I may require some assistance with this endeavor. Dad wants me to
pick up some bikinis for his <i>secretary</i>," he stated to the girls with a
brief chuckle.</p>

<p>"But I need a couple of models," he continued as he expertly flipped the
card back and forth between his fingers. "The two of you are about her size.
What do you say, gals?"</p>

<p>"Upchuck, are you aware that many therapists now accept credit cards?"
deadpanned Jane.</p>

<p>"Fiesty," the boy purred which prompted an eye roll and slight head shake
from Alex.</p>

<p>"If he keeps this up, he's going to find that most hospitals also accept
gold cards," remarked Daria with a frown.</p>

<p>"You OK Dia?" asked Alex as he glanced back and noticed a slightly pained
expression on his sister's face</p>

<p>"Daria?" asked a concerned Jane</p>

<p>"I feel sick," the bespectacled girl stated.</p>

<p>"Looks like the old Ruttheimer charm is working as expected eh Upchuck?" quipped
Jane.</p>

<p>"No, I really do feel sick," stated Daria with a pained expression. "Can
someone open a window?"</p>

<p>Jane turned in her spot next to the window and attempted to open it with
little success.</p>

<p>"I think it's jammed," she stated as she pushed against the uncooperative
pane of glass.</p>

<p>"Allow me, fair maiden," offered Upchuck as he stood from his own seat and
slid past Daria and Jane and began to work on the window.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you got car sick," stated Jane as she ripped a sheet from her
sketch pad and used it to fan her green around the gills friend.</p>

<p>"She usually doesn't," responded Alex. "Unless she's foolish enough to try
to read on a bumpy road."</p>

<p>"I think it's the fumes," Daria stated. "It smells like... it smells
like..."</p>

<p>"Teen spirit?" asked Jane jokingly</p>

<p>"Cheap cologne or perfume," answered Daria.</p>

<p>Both girls turned towards Charles as he continued to struggle with the
window.</p>

<p>"I'll... have you ladies know..." replied Upchuck between grunts of exertion as he
fought against the uncooperative window. "I only wear... fragrances of the...
highest quality."</p>

<p>'<i>Largest quantity is more like it,' </i>thought Daria as she removed her
glasses and covered her eyes.</p>

<p>"Smells a little too flowery for cologne," observed Alex as he slid open the
window on his seat.</p>

<p>"You're right," agreed Jane after sniffing the air a few times.</p>

<p>"Brittany must be working up a sweat," she stated with a smirk as she
glanced around and noticed she didn't see the bubbly cheerleader's face.</p>

<p>"What could she be..." began Alex before he the realization came to him. "On
the bus?"</p>

<p>"As a wise woman once said, 'Never underestimate the ability of Kevin and
Brittany to not care where they make out'," advised Jane.</p>

<p>"Was that wise woman or wiseass?" asked Daria as she remembered her friend's
words from Quinn's disastrous 'accidental' party the month before.</p>

<p>She then slid past Jane and took Upchuck's now vacant window seat beside her
brother. She handed her glasses to the boy, closed her eyes and leaned her head
against the cool glass of the window. Alex pocketed his sister's glasses and
began gently rubbing her back with a concerned expression.</p>

<p>Upchuck ceased his efforts against the securely jammed window and sidled up
to Jane.</p>

<p>"So Ms. Lane... about that modeling opportunity," cheesed the redhead with a
waggling of eyebrows as he draped his arm over the back of the seat.</p>

<p>"Only in your wildest dreams and my worst nightmares, Upchuck," responded
Jane coldly as she stood up and moved into the seat in front of them next to
Alex.</p>

<p>"Grrrrrrr, Fiesty!" purred Upchuck.</p>

</div>

<p>The parking lot tram, made up of a string of connected 4-seat golfcart like
vehicles, slowly ferried the students and other visitors from the expansive
parking lot towards the Mall itself</p>

<p>"Welcome to the Mall of the Millennium, the world's second or third largest
mall," announced the recorded voice from speakers mounted in each tram cart.
The announcement continued to provide trivial PR about the mall and it's
amenities that were ignored by almost every passenger of the tram. Only Mrs.
Bennett paid any attention to it.</p>

<p>"Feeling any better," asked Jane as the tram slowly moved along.</p>

<p>"A little bit," answered Daria as she recovered her gasses from Alex.</p>

<p>"You'll be fine once we get away from all of the gas fumes and into the
happy recycled and conditioned air in the Mall," joked Alex.</p>

<p>Jane was prepared to add a comment but it was cut off as the tram bounced
over a few small potholes and caused her and other students to grab their seats
reflexively.</p>

<p>"I'd be happy to be off vehicles and on my own two feet for a while,"
remarked Daria, punctuated with a small burp.</p>

<p>"Oh, that was oh so ladylike," teased Jane.</p>

<p>Further barbs were interrupted by the sound of a loud slap, which was then
followed by an all too familiar "Fiesty!"</p>

<p>Alex glanced back towards the tram car holding Kevin, Brittany and Charles.
Brittany appeared to be quite angry about something. It didn't take an honor
student to identify the source of her anger when he noticed that Charles was
holding the side of his face and grinning like the Cheshire Cat.</p>

<p>Alex shook his head at his friend and thought,<i> 'I swear that boy is never
going to learn.' </i></p>

<p>The tram circled slowly up to the front doors of the Mall and trundled over
several sets of small speed bumps.</p>

<p>"I think I'm going to be sick," Daria announced as she held her hands over
her stomach.</p>

<p>The tram screeched to an abrupt stop, jostling all of its passengers quite
thoroughly in the process. The bulk of the students exited their tram cars and
stood staring in awe at the impressive fa&ccedil;ade of the mall's primary entrance.</p>

<p>"Any chance you can hold it till we get to a bathroom?" asked Jane as she
exited their car and watched Alex help his sister from their car.</p>

<p>Daria immediately doubled over and began to vomit on the tiled walkway. Alex
quickly moved his sister's hair away from her face and rubbed her back as she
emptied her stomach onto the pavement.</p>

<p>'<i>I'll take that as a No,' </i>came Jane's internal response.</p>

<p>"Looks like the car sickness finally caught up with her," said Charles as he
carefully approached his friend and the girls.</p>

<p>"Well if anyone would know about making girls sick..." quipped Jane.</p>

<p>"What's going on?" asked Mrs. Bennett as she pushed through the gathering of
disgusted students (standing well away from Daria) who watched the spectacle.</p>

<p>The teacher approached the trio as Daria slowly returned to a fully upright
position.</p>

<p>"Oh dear... are you alright Daria?" the concerned teacher asked.</p>

<p>"She got a bit motion sick from the bus ride," answered Alex.</p>

<p>"I'm sure the tram ride didn't do anything to help either," observed Mrs.
Bennett placed a reassuring hand on Daria's shoulder.</p>

<p>"I tried to warn you," reminded Daria as she subtly moved away from the
teacher.</p>

<p>"I've been on boat rides during a storm that were smoother than that tram
ride," commented Jane.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you're going to be alright dear," the teacher asked again.</p>

<p>"I feel a lot better now," confirmed Daria. "I just need to get somewhere
solid that doesn't smell like diesel, sweat and cheap perfume for a little
while."</p>

<p>"Maybe we can find somewhere like that after we're done at the Mall," joked
Jane, which drew a chuckle from Mrs. Bennett and more than a few of the
gathered students.</p>

<p>"Alright students, let's go experience some applied consumer economics,"
Mrs. Bennett announced as she began to herd the students towards the entrance
of the mall.</p>

<p>As the student's entered the building through its expansive glass doors,
Jane noticed two workers in beige jumpers with mops and buckets exit the
building. As she held the door open for the Alex and Daria, she glanced back
and watched the pair begin to clean up the tiled walkway.</p>

<p>"Welcome to the Mall of the Millennium," she stated before she entered the
building end joined her classmates.</p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>

<hr size=1 width="100%" noshade color=gray align=center>

</div>

<p>Mrs. Bennett stood before a back-lit square post that held the map of the
mall. She scratched her head a few times as she attempted to decipher their
current location in relation to where they wanted to go. Students milled about
while the teacher struggled with the map.<br>
Daria took the opportunity to sit on a nearby bench overlooking the lower
levels. Alex Jane, Jodie and Mack stood nearby. The sounds of children
screaming in excitement drew the attention of the group.</p>

<p>"Can you believe they actually have a working roller coaster inside the
mall?" asked Jodie as she watched the coaster car on its high speed path.</p>

<p>"You know we're going to see it on the news one day. 'Coaster disaster at
the Mall of the Millenium'," stated Mack as he leaned against the rail and
joined the others in watching the ride.</p>

<p>"Maybe we'll get lucky and they'll have live footage of the ensuing
carnage," added Jane.</p>

<p>"How can you even think that Jane?" asked a shocked Jodie.</p>

<p>"It's the underlying sense of morbid fascination inherent in all people,"
responded Daria as she stood and joined the others at the rail.</p>

<p>"The same principle that causes people to slow down on the freeway when we
see a wreck," added Alex.</p>

<p>"Or watch horror movies," added Jane.</p>

<p>"Or Nascar and rodeos," stated Daria with a smirk at her brother.</p>

<p>"I distinctly remember a certain someone who would sit right beside me
watching those," he remarked with his own smirk.</p>

<p>"Hey now. Quinn doesn't judge you. It would be bad form to judge her,"
deadpanned Daria.</p>

<p>"I also remember it being your idea to have her make the snacks while we
watched Nascar so that you wouldn't miss any of the race," he rebutted.</p>

<p>"See one car blow up in the pits and you're hooked for life," complained
Daria as Jane and the others laughed.</p>

<p>"Though in all fairness, there wasn't much in the form of intelligent
programming on the local channels in Highland," observed Alex.</p>

<p>"Not a lot of diversity in your entertainment choices eh?" reasoned Mack.</p>

<p>"We didn't have cable so we were relegated to whatever we could find on the
local channels," answered Daria</p>

<p>&quot;Least you got that though,&quot; commented Alex. &quot;Nothing but
CNN, The History Channel and the Military channel at Buxton got tiresome after
the 1st 6 months.&quot;</p>

<p>"But one can take only so many hours of Sesame Street and hunting shows in a
day," remarked Daria.</p>

<p><i>'And Dad wondered why I would hang around with the Dim-witted Duo,'</i>
she thought with her usual subdued smile. <i>'Well, aside from their general
gullibility and high entertainment value.'</i></p>

<p>"Alright class," came Mrs. Bennett's voice. "Ms. Li has managed to schedule
a meeting with Chad Maximillian, Chief Financial Administrator for the Mall of
the Millennium. They've graciously set aside some time to discus mall
operations with us. We'll get an inside perspective on applied economics at the
retail level. Won't that be wonderful?"</p>

<p>Her cheerful gaze drifted across the gathered faces and took in the
impassive reactions of her students.</p>

<p>"And since she has allowed us the day for this trip, though I doubt we'll need
that much time, once we're done you'll be able to start your weekend a little
early," she added.</p>

<p>As she expected, the children began to cheer earnestly.</p>

<p>"I figured that would get your attention," she said with a knowing smile.</p>

<p>"We'll walk down R Moss, and turn right at Q Canary," the teacher announced
as she pointed out their path on the large display screen.</p>

<p>"Wow," said Brittany in awe as she looked intently at the map. "Who would
ever guess there'd be so many colors? The person who thought them all up must
be a genius."</p>

<p>"Yeah, and we haven't even gotten to puke green yet," commented Jane.</p>

<p>She then glanced at Daria who returned an icy and still slightly queasy
glare. "Oh, yeah, we passed that one first."</p>

<p>The class began walking at a casual pace with Mrs. Bennett in the lead. The
teacher examined a paper copy of the mall map as she attempted to navigate
through the building.</p>

<p>"OK, so it's right at T Periwinkle, then a left at N Cranberry. Wait, is
that cranberry or magenta?" the woman asked as she scrutinized the map.</p>

<p>After a moment of confusion she looked up from her map and spotted Jane.</p>

<p>"Jane, dear, you're an artist," she said as she handed the map to the girl.
"Is this cranberry or magenta?"</p>

<p>Jane examined the map for a moment as Alex, Charles and Daria looked over
her shoulder, then replied "I think it's cranapple,"</p>

<p>"Mrs. B," prompted Upchuck. "Can we please stop for a minute at Bikini
Island? I'd like to buy a few trifles for the ladies, and perhaps you'd care to
pick out something for yourself?"</p>

<p>"Not now, 'll be late for our meeting with the mall executives. I had to
work very hard to arrange this. These are very important, very busy..." Mrs.
Bennett responded with a sigh before her eyes grew wide and she began bouncing
excitedly in place. "oh, oh, oooooh!"</p>

<p>"What is it, Mrs. B?" asked Upchuck as he and the rest of the students were
caught off guard by their teacher's sudden exuberant behavior.</p>

<p>She then moved hurriedly towards a nearby storefront and peered through the
large glass picture window at the displays.</p>

<p>"The Fuzzy Wuzzy Wee-Bit Shop!" the woman exclaimed excitedly. "Herbert and
I collect Fuzzy Wuzzy Wee Bits!"</p>

<p>She leaned forward with her hands and face pressed to the glass.</p>

<p>"Aren't they adorable? Look, a Fuzzy Wuzzy Wee Bits cactus! And look at that
little bunny rabbit with its own Fuzzy Wuzzy carrot!" Mrs. Bennett said
laughingly.</p>

<p>"I think I'm going to be sick again," commented Daria.</p>

<p>Jane glanced at her friend with concern before she noticed the smirk on the
bespectacled girls face.</p>

<p>"Yeah, this much cute should be illegal," added Alex as he and the rest
moved towards the store. "Or at least come with a medical warning of some kind
for diabetics."</p>

<p>"I don't know," commented Jane as she leaned forward to get a look into the
front display. "Some of these do have a certain appeal."</p>

<p>The twins were about to inquire into their friend's mental stability when
they noticed a small sign labeled "Limited Editions on Sale!"</p>

<p>"Fair enough," said Daria as she followed her friend's gaze and thought
about where in her room she could best display the miniature plush Alien face
hugger.</p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>

<hr size=1 width="100%" noshade color=gray align=center>

</div>

<p>The students sat around a large oval table in one of the mall's large
conference rooms. The room was brightly lit and while there were no windows in
the room, as it was located in an inner section of the building, one wall was
taken up from waist height to ceiling by a large mirror.</p>

<p>"And of course, when you go to the mall, you look for what?" asked a man
dressed in a nice dark blue suit and tie.</p>

<p>"Bikinis," stated Upchuck which drew a raised eyebrow from the other two
mall execs.</p>

<p>"Make that lovely, luscious, ladies in bikinis!" he quickly added.</p>

<p>"Yeah!" agreed Kevin which rewarded him with a punch in the arm from Brittany.</p>

<p>" Ow!" he exclaimed. "But babe... you look hot in a bikini."</p>

<p>"Feisty!" growled Upchuck with a leer and a wink towards Brittany who stood
and stomped over towards the mirrored wall.</p>

<p>"Children please," chided Mrs. Bennett. "I'm sorry Mr. Maximillian."</p>

<p>"Call me Chad. It's OK." he dismissed. "I remember what it was like to be a
kid."</p>

<p>"Anyone else?" he prompted as he looked to the other students around the
room.</p>

<p>"I always look for security guards leading away someone in handcuffs,"
remarked Jane which drew another set of raised eyebrows from the two executives
who had accompanied Mr. Maximillian. "Shoplifters are the best judges of
merchandise."</p>

<p>"I meant more along the line of the qualities you look for?" Chad clarified.
"The stores? What should they be like?"</p>

<p>"Perky... a little bouncy... not too bouncy..." mused Brittany aloud as she
posed in front of the mirror and examined her reflection.</p>

<p>"What?!" asked Chad with a confused expression as he turned his attention to
the cheerleader.</p>

<p>"What?" returned Brittany, oblivious to the actual topic of discussion.</p>

<p>"I have a question," interjected Jodie with a raised hand.</p>

<p>After a nod from the man she continued, "Do you think our demographic can
really be addressed by middle-aged middle managers telling us what's fun to
buy?"</p>

<p>"Umm... well..." stumbled the administrator, clearly thrown off by such a
pointed question. His gaze moved quickly across the other students before it
settled on Daria.</p>

<p>"How about you? How many times a year do you go to the mall?" he asked
hopefully.</p>

<p>"Don't people usually get paid for participating in this kind of market
research?" Daria stated flatly.</p>

<p>"Research?" asked Mr. Maximillian in a nervous voice.</p>

<p>"Now, children," chided Mrs. Bennett. "These busy gentlemen have been nice
enough to give their time to help educate us on mall economics. Tell us about
flow, would you?"</p>

<p>"Of course" stated the man with a relieved exhale.</p>

<p>Alex leaned towards Jane and nodded towards Brittany, still posing before
the mirrored wall.</p>

<p>"I bet those guys are enjoying the show," he whispered as the Chad gave a
brief explanation of the mall's profit flow.</p>

<p>"What show?" asked a confused Jane. &quot;What guys?&quot;</p>

<p>"That's most likely a two-way mirror," informed Daria.</p>

<p>Jane looked at the mirror for a moment then asked, "You mean, like the ones
in movies where if you turn out the lights you can see through it?"</p>

<p>"That's typically how it's done," answered Daria in whisper. "There are
probably a couple of analysts on the other side..."</p>

<p>"Watching us and writing down our responses for future marketing ideas,"
finished her brother.</p>

<p>"Didn't you say people normally get paid for participating in these kinds of
things?" Jane asked.</p>

<p>"Yep," answered Alex.</p>

<p>"The standard rate is about 10 to 15 an hour for the average Joe," Daria
stated.</p>

<p>"I'm more interested in how much they'll pay the slightly above average
Jane," the raven haired girl commented quietly.</p>

<p>Jane glanced behind her and noticed she was sitting within arm's reach of
the light control panel. With a loud fake yawn, she leaned back in her chair
and stretched in a slow exaggerated manner and flipped the two main switches
off, which instantly darkened the interior of the conference room. Without the
interior light of the conference room, everyone's attention was drawn to the
mirrored wall, which now looked more like a windowed wall. It was impossible to
ignore the three observers sitting on the other side of the glass with
surprised expressions on their faces.</p>

<p>Brittany jumped back from the mirror and issued a startled "Eep!"</p>

<p>One of the executives rushed to the light switch panel and turned the lights
back on and settled a disapproving scowl at Jane.</p>

<p>"Whoops, clumsy me," the girl remarked with a grin.</p>

<p>The mirrored wall was once again a reflective surface, but the damage had
already been done. The disapproving murmur of the students did not sit too well
with the executives.</p>

<p><i>'Well that explains how Angela was able to arrange this meeting so
easily,'</i> thought Mrs. Bennett with a sigh.</p>

<p>"The focus group is, um, a very important tool in mall management," Chad
explained with a nervous laugh. "We thought that with this live
demonstration..."</p>

<p>"I feel used. I feel abused," interrupted Jodie angrily. "I feel that this
is not a fun mall after all and the media should be made aware of it."</p>

<p>"I bet that wouldn't be too good for your flow would it Chad," teased Jane
with a smirk.</p>

<p>"All right, little lady," Mr. Maximillian responded as he reached inside his
jacket and pulled a colored coupon from his vest pocket. "Here's a coupon for a
free frozen yogurt."</p>

<p>"Don't insult me," scoffed Jodie as she crossed her arms and scowled at the
man.</p>

<p>"Make it a ten dollar merchandise coupon," he stated as he pulled another
coupon book from his opposing vest pocket.</p>

<p>"You're still insulting her," commented Jane.</p>

<p>Chad sighed and pulled the remaining coupons from his pocket with a sigh and
announced, "Okay, a twenty dollar merchandise coupon for everyone in the
class."</p>

<p>"You don't get it," stated Daria. "There's a principle involved."</p>

<p>"Actually Daria... No, there isn't," commented Jodie as she stood and accepted
a coupon from the man.</p>

<p>The other students followed Jodie's lead and formed a line to receive
coupons of their own from Mr. Maximillian.</p>

<p>"So much for idealistic youth," Daria stated as she noted Jane had stood and
was moving to join the other students. "Where's your sense of ethical outrage?"</p>

<p>"Hey! That's twenty bucks!" answered the artist as she walked over to claim
her own merchandise coupon. "More than the average Joe for an hour, right?"</p>

<p>"She makes an effective argument," stated Alex as he rose from his own seat
and walked after Jane.</p>

<p>"Et Tu, Lex," stated Daria as she also stood and joined her brother.</p>

<p>"Look at it this way. They didn't get any usable info from their little scam
but we still get paid," he replied as they reached the end of the line.</p>

<p>"True... but it's still pretty crappy if you ask me," she remarked.</p>

<p>"Just think of it as a practical lesson in business economics," came Mrs.
Bennett's voice.</p>

<p>The twins turned to see the teacher standing in line in front of them. She
winked at them and stepped to Mr. Maximillian</p>

<p>They glanced at each other, shrugged and stepped up to receive coupons of
their own from the none too pleased Financial Administrator.</p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>

<hr size=1 width="100%" noshade color=gray align=center>

</div>

<p>Mrs. Bennet and her students stood near the 2nd floor elevators near another
of the mall's map displays. Most of the students examined the $20 slips they
received and complained.</p>

<p>Charles walked away from Kevin and Brittany to rejoin Alex and the girls
with a toothy grin.</p>

<p>"I'm almost afraid to know what he's so happy about," commented Daria.</p>

<p>"Mission accomplished," the freckled boy announced.</p>

<p>"You seem to still have a full set of teeth, so I doubt Brittany agreed to
model bikinis for you," commented Alex.</p>

<p>"Maybe Kevin agreed to model for him," quipped Jane which caused Charles'
grin to become a frown.</p>

<p>"There's a mental picture I could have done without," chimed Alex with a
disgusted expression.</p>

<p>"Did anyone get a coupon for Brain Bleach by any chance?" asked Daria.</p>

<p>"If you must know, I was able to broker an exchange with our star
quarterback and his luscious companion that was mutually beneficial for all
involved," interjected Charles.</p>

<p>"Vioala!" he exclaimed as he held up two of the merchandise coupons and
handed one to Alex. "I Overheard Kevin and Brittany voicing similar dismay to
ours over the stores their coupons were for and arranged an exchange."</p>

<p>"'Books By the Ton - The country's biggest bookstore',&quot; read Alex
"Nice."</p>

<p>"I'd be happy to make my bartering skills available to you two lovely
ladies," offered Upchuck with a waggle of his eye brows.</p>

<p>Jane and Daria glanced at each other and examined their own coupons.</p>

<p>"'Scissor Wizard'. Groovy, I can actually use a new pair of scissors,"
stated Jane as she looked at Daria. "What'd you get?"</p>

<p>Daria glanced at her own coupon and slid it into her pocket.</p>

<p>"Not what I'd have originally gone with but I think I can make use of it,"
she advised. "So thanks, but no thanks."</p>

<p>"Gather round children," stated Mrs. Bennett. "I have some assignments for you."</p>

<p>The students began groaning as they formed a semicircle around the teacher.</p>

<p>"I know you'd rather just mill about aimlessly, but remember this little
trip has a purpose," the teacher chided. "Alexander and Charles, you'll observe
traffic patterns at the food concessions. Daria and Jane, I'd like the two of
you to talk to several store managers on the 1st floor and find out their best
selling merchandise. Jodie and Mack will do the same for the 2nd floor. Andrea
and Lance will do the same for the 3rd."</p>

<p>The teacher continued to assign varying sections and associated tasks to the
remainder of the students, handing out notepads and pens as she did.</p>

<p>"What do you want us to do Mrs. Bennett?" asked Brittany as she idly twirled
her finger in the end of her hair.</p>

<p>"Kevin and Brittany, you will study and report back on shrinkage," the
teacher stated as she handed note pads to them.</p>

<p>"Shrinkage?" asked Kevin. "They've got a swimming pool in the mall? Cool!"</p>

<p>Jane put her hand in her mouth in an attempt to stifle the raucous laughter
that threatened to escape. Daria, Jodie and Mack smirked similarly at Kevin's
line of thought and Alex gave a cough to vainly hide his own amusement. Most of
the other students didn't bother with decorum and laugh openly at the
quarterback's comment.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett sighed and explained, "Shrinkage is the retailing term for
shoplifting. I'd like you to analyze its economic impact."</p>

<p>"Does everyone else understand their assignments?" she asked to the
remaining students and received murmurs and nods.<i> "</i>Now, we'll meet back
here at a quarter to three. Remember, area F, section Moss, level three. Got
it? F Moss Three."</p>

<p>"Got it," confirmed Kevin. "But I have a question."</p>

<p>"Yes Kevin," the teacher prompted.</p>

<p>"Was I supposed to bring my swimming trunks or will they have some I can
borrow at the pool?" he asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett's only reply was to close her eyes and lowered her head with a
loud sigh.</p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>

<hr size=1 width="100%" noshade color=gray align=center>

</div>

<p>"So which store should we check out first?" asked Mack as he and Jodie
strolled casually down the walkways of the Mall's 2nd floor.</p>

<p>"I was thinking we should choose several different types of stores to get a
broader sample group," Jodie answered.</p>

<p>"Makes sense to me," remarked Mack as he glanced at a few of the storefronts
on either side of the isle and noted no discernable pattern to the layout.
"Shouldn't be too difficult."</p>

<p>"We should also stop by Cashman's," suggested Jodie thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Looking to pick up another outfit for school? Sure you don't want to join
the Fashion Club after all?" teased Mack.</p>

<p>"Actually, I was thinking we could submit an addendum to our assignment once
we get back next week for some extra credit," replied the girl. "Comparing the
one here with the local branch in Lawndale."</p>

<p><i>'We finally get a touch of us time and all she can think about is extra
credit when we get back,' </i>thought Mack with a sigh as he reached into his
pocket and felt the crumple of paper.</p>

<p>He glanced at his coupon and an idea formed immediately.</p>

<p>"I've got a better idea. How about we hit the first 5 or so stores we see..."
he offered as he slipped his coupon into her hand. "Then head over to Floral
Explosion and see how many daffodils we can get with this?"</p>

<p>Jodie looked at the florally decorated slip of paper then smiled up at her
boyfriend.</p>

<p><i>'How does he always managers to remember the little things like my
favorite flower' </i>Jodie wondered.</p>

<p>"I think the first 3 would probably be enough," she stated as she looped her
arm around Mack's waist.</p>

</div>

<p>"Think we've got enough info?" asked Jane as she and Daria exited a candle and
incense themed store and began walk towards the elevators and escalators.</p>

<p>"I hope so," replied Daria as she flipped her notepad closed and pocketed
her pen.. "Because I think I've exhausted my interest in 'flow' for the year."</p>

<p>"You over your motion sickness?" prompted Jane.</p>

<p>"No need to worry. Your boots are safe from further attempts at
regurgitative assault," deadpanned Daria.</p>

<p>"Good. Because I'm starving," answered Jane. "How about we go meet up with
Alex and find out how his assignment is coming along."</p>

<p>"Always thinking with your stomach," quipped Daria as she stopped and faced
her friend with her subdued smile. "Well, it is your most well developed muscle
group so better that than what's allegedly between your ears."</p>

<p>"I would reply but my thinking muscle needs more power to come up with a
sufficiently scathing and witty rebuttal," replied Jane with a smile of her
own.</p>

<p>"Hey, look," the raven haired girl stated as she noticed they had stopped in
front of Scissor Wizard. "I can use my coupon."</p>

<p>Once they entered the store, they discovered immediately that it was a hair
salon as opposed to a scissor specialty shop as they initially thought.</p>

<p>"You got here just in time," came a voice from their right.</p>

<p>The girls turned to see a twentyish man in a tight short sleeved shirt
approach them. He reached out and cupped the bottom edges of Jane's hair and
examined her face intently.</p>

<p>"Um,... I've got this coupon," Jane began.</p>

<p>The hairdresser nodded, took her by the hand and lead her to a styling
chair.</p>

<p>"The style suits your face. Not a bad job..." commented the stylist aloud as
he also took note of the split ends and slight unevenness of her bangs. "But
not a great job either. Who normally cuts your hair honey?"</p>

<p>"Actually I usually cut it myself," Jane responded confused.</p>

<p>"Decent work for an amateur but you really should let us professionals do it
next time," the man stated as he continued manipulating Jane's dark tresses and
slowly turning the chair he had her sitting in.</p>

<p>"I'll keep that in mind, but I just wanted a pair of scissors," she
responded.</p>

<p>"We don't sell scissors, we cut hair," the man fired back. "Which show?"</p>

<p>"What?" asked Jane even more confused than before.</p>

<p>The hairdresser let out a frustrated sigh before responding, "Which TV show
do you want your style from? Most of our clients go for a sitcom or something
from one of those tween dramas."</p>

<p>He turned Jane around to face him and he leaned in close to the girls face.</p>

<p>"Although, you strike me as more the &quot;movie of the week&quot; type," he
stated. "Love the eyes by the way. How much were they?"</p>

<p>"Huh," asked Daria and Jane in unison.</p>

<p>"The contacts honey, how much did they cost you," he prompted as he turned
her around again and began to run a fine toothed comb through Jane's hair.</p>

<p>"Oh! Wow, been a while since any one asked that," said Jane with a chuckle.
"Hate to disappoint, but they're not contacts. These baby blues are 100% mine."</p>

<p>"I know girls that would kill for your look," he stated laughingly</p>

<p>"You know we only came here because we thought you sold scissors," stated
Daria.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I doubt I've got the time or money for the kind of treatment you guys
normally give," stated Jane as she looked at her coupon again.</p>

<p>"Let me see," said the man as he glanced over Jane's shoulder and noted the
amount of the coupon. "$20 bucks eh? That would get you a basic rinse and a
trim, which is about all you need anyway hon."</p>

<p>"I don't know..." stated Jane hesitantly.</p>

<p>"I can have you all set and out of here in 20 minutes... just about when my
next appointment should show up," the stylist offered as he grasped Jane's hand
and helped her up from the chair.</p>

<p>"You think it's a good idea? This guy seems a bit odd," whispered Daria. "A
little too anxious to get you in the chair if you catch my drift."</p>

<p>"Unless I spontaneously switch from Jane to John, I don't think I've got
much to worry," joked Jane in whispered response.</p>

<p>Daria took a second look at the stylist and smirked at her oversight.</p>

<p>"If I'm not back in 20 minutes..." stated Jane at a normal volume as the
stylist lead her back towards the row of sinks on the far end of the salon.</p>

<p>"I'll send the search party," finished Daria as she smirked at her friend
being dragged to have her hair washed.</p>

<p>"Oh look, '50 Ways to Get Your Man to Ask You to the Prom'," stated Daria
with mock enthusiasm as she picked up one of the magazines set beside the
waiting area, settled into one of the plush seats and began to read.</p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>

<hr size=1 width="100%" noshade color=gray align=center>

</div>

<p>20 minutes later, Daria scrutinized her friend's hair. The stylist hadn't
really done much to it other than a conditioning rinse and cleaned up an almost
unnoticeable unevenness to the cut of the girl's dark hair. Paying close
attention, Daria noticed the subtle differences. Jane's hair had been brushed
and styled so that instead of simply hanging straight down as it usually did,
the ends curled slightly upwards towards her neck. And while her hair was shiny
by nature, it now held a touch more volume than it usually did.</p>

<p>"I'll have to find that conditioner back in Lawndale," commented Jane. "I
can actually feel my scalp tingling."</p>

<p>"That's just the ebola doing seeping in," joked Daria. "You ready it hit the
food court?"</p>

<p>"Nothing like stuffing your face to really set off a nice free pampering,"
commented Jane.</p>

<p>As she and Jane exited the salon Daria slammed into another person walking
into the store and both landed unceremoniously on their posteriors.</p>

<p>"Ugh, like watch where you're... Daria?" said a familiar voice.</p>

<p>"Quinn?" asked Daria confused.</p>

<p>As Jane helped her up, Daria arranged her glasses to a normal position on
her face and saw Stacy helping her sister up from the floor. The other members
of the Fashion Club were also present</p>

<p>"Well, well, what an unexpected opportunity for sibling bonding," commented
Daria snidely.</p>

<p>"Ugh, I'm going to be sick," commented said Quinn.</p>

<p>"Quinn... ewwwww," responded Tiffany slowly.</p>

<p>"Is that, like, a family thing?" quipped Jane, which drew a glare from
Daria.</p>

<p>"What are you two doing at a salon?" asked Quinn.</p>

<p>"What are you doing in this part of the state?" Daria inquired as she
refocused on Quinn. "You're not in Mrs. Bennett's Economics class."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bennett is here?!" Quinn asked with wide eyes.</p>

<p>"Yep and the rest of our class," confirmed Jane.</p>

<p>"I'll bet she'd be thrilled to see you four here. Just as pleased as Mom and
Dad will be to hear I ran into you here... at the mall... on this lovely school
day," remarked Daria with a subtle smirk.</p>

<p>Quinn's glanced at her three friends who all had similar expressions of
worry.</p>

<p>"Kuh-Whinn, it would be most unfortunate if the Fashion Club were to get in trouble
because of your geeky sister," stated Sandi.</p>

<p>"Oh god, they're gonna find out we skipped," said Stacy frantically. "We're
going to get suspended... or expelled... or excommunicated..."</p>

<p>"Stacy! Breathe," commanded Quinn which seemed to settle the other girl.
"Just give us a minute guys."</p>

<p>She beckoned Daria and walked away from the other Fashion Club members.</p>

<p>"Okay, state your terms," the younger Morgendorffer prompted as her sister
and Jane approached.</p>

<p>"You know...It's strange. I can't think of anything I'd want..." Daria
commented whistfully. "At least not anything from <b><i>you</i></b>."</p>

<p>"How about a free makeover?" Quinn offered half-heartedly.</p>

<p>"No matter how many times you make it, that offer will be declined as
usual," replied Daria. "However, it would be nice to take it easy around the
house for a little while. Maybe a month."</p>

<p>"A <i>month?! </i>"No way!"Quinn exclaimed. "You're like loosing it if you
think I'm gonna put up with doing your chores for a month."</p>

<p>"It's that, or you can just never set foot inside a mall for the rest of
your sorry adolescent life," stated Daria.</p>

<p>Quinn fumed and realized she had little to no bargaining leverage in the
current situation.</p>

<p>"Speaking of setting foot in the mall," continued Daria. "How did you guys
get here?"</p>

<p>"We got one of the junior varsity to drive us in his dad's SUV," informed
Quinn.</p>

<p>Daria smiled subtly as an idea formed.</p>

<p>"OK, since I'm really not in the mood to take the bus back, here's the
deal," stated Daria. "Two weeks and a ride home from your little friend and Mom
and Dad need never know of this."</p>

<p>"But we still have shopping to do. How are we going to fit the two of you <b><i>and</i></b>
our stuff?" whined Quinn.</p>

<p>"Three... you're forgetting Lex," reminded Daria. "And I would highly
recommend cutting your shopping trip short before you run into any of the other
students."</p>

<p>"Or Mrs. B," added Jane.</p>

<p>"Ugh! Fine! We've still got to check out one or two things before we leave
so this trip won't be like a complete waste," agreed Quinn vehemently as she
checked her designer watch and stalked back towards Sandi, Stacy and Tiffany.
"Meet us in an hour on level five, area D, section Lavender."</p>

<p>"You got that?" asked Daria with a glance in Jane's direction and received a
nod.</p>

<p>"Pleasure doing business with you," commented Daria with a smirk as she and
Jane walked past Quinn and the Fashion Club.</p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>

<hr size=1 width="100%" noshade color=gray align=center>

</div>

<p>"And that's 30," stated Alex with a glance at his watch. "Looks like the
Taco Shack has more traffic per hour than the Chinese place."</p>

<p>"And I was sure Chinese would have the bigger appeal," replied a
disappointed Charles.</p>

<p>"I told you fast and cheap beats out exotic and plentiful in most
situations," Alex remarked. "You come to the mall for shopping, not dinner.
Just be glad you had the good sense to decline my bet about the nacho and
pretzel stand or you'd be down more than just footing the lunch bill four our
group."</p>

<p>"While I'm sure that Mrs. Bennett will be thrilled with the added detail
we've been able to get over the past half hour ...weren't the luscious Miss Lane
and your lovely sister supposed to meet us quite some time ago?" the freckled
boy observed.</p>

<p>"They probably got stuck with a talkative store manager," Alex ventured
before he spotted Jane headed in their general direction.</p>

<p>"Speak of the devil," he commented as the girls stopped beside him.</p>

<p>"What's the devil doing here?" quipped Jane.</p>

<p>"Probably buying a snow cone," deadpanned Daria.</p>

<p>"What took you so long?" asked Alex before he raised a curious eyebrow at
Jane and asked, "Did you get a new earring or something?"</p>

<p>"No, seven is my limit," she replied with a grin. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Something's different and I can't figure out what," he responded with a
tilt of his head.</p>

<p>"She looks her usual radiant and ravishing self," added Upchuck.</p>

<p>"Other than having my ears evened up I can't think of anything," Jane commented.</p>

<p>"That's what it is," Alex confirmed. "You got your hair styled."</p>

<p><i>'It's subtle but I guess if you're looking for it you can see the
difference,' </i>thought Daria with a shrug.</p>

<p>"But to answer your original question we kind of ran into someone unexpected,"
Jane answered.</p>

<p>"Who," Alex asked with a raised eyebrow.</p>

<p>"You'll find out in a bit," replied Daria. "But for now I'm famished so
let's eat."</p>

<p>"I'll second that motion," agreed Jane.</p>

<p>"Motion seconded... motion carries," said Alex as the four began moving casually
towards the various restaurants.</p>

<p>"You know if you girls hadn't been so rapt with your primping and preening
we would have more time to eat and still get in our quota of aimless
loitering," teased Alex. "At this rate we'll only have half an hour before we
have to be back on the bus."</p>

<p>"I'm torn between thanking you for noticing and being upset at you for
accusing me of not only primping, but preening," responded Jane with
exaggerated false outrage. "I'll just have to let you make it up to me by
buying me lunch."</p>

<p>Alex and Charles chuckled while Daria merely smiled subtly at Jane's
comments.</p>

<p>"Feeding yourself and Jane?" asked Daria. "Hope you managed to get an
advance on your allowance before we came."</p>

<p>"Fortunately for my wallet, I won't need to, as a certain someone lost a
wager involving my food bill for this outing," stated Alex as he cast a grin to
Charles.</p>

<p>"So lunch is on Upchuck," stated Daria.</p>

<p>"It would be my honor, nay privilege to share lunch with such lovely
company. The least I can do is fund the bounteous meal," stated Upchuck
dramatically with a toothy grin.</p>

<p>"Guess he's useful for something once in a while," quipped Jane.</p>

<p>"His dad's gold card is anyway," commented Daria.</p>

<p>"Shall we?" Jane prompted haughtily as she extended an arm to Alex.</p>

<p>"To our repast," responded Alex in similar style as he hooked his arm with
Jane's and the two made their way to the rows of eateries in the food court.</p>

<p>"Allow me to escort you my enticing erudite enchantress," offered Upchuck
with an extended arm to Daria.</p>

<p>"I would love to Upchuck. But puking once a day is my limit," stated Daria
flatly as she walked away from the freckled boy to join her brother and friend.</p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>

<hr size=1 width="100%" noshade color=gray align=center>

</div>

<p>"So where are we going again?" asked Alex as he stuffed his hands into the pockets
of his camouflage jacket.</p>

<p>"It's a surprise," replied Daria as she waited for Jane to enter the
elevator before she tapped the button for the 5th floor.</p>

<p>The three were quickly lifted to the 5th floor's Lavender section. When the
doors open they stepped out and were greeted by the sight of the Fashion Club
waiting for them</p>

<p>"Hey Pip. Ladies" greeted Alex in surprise. "I didn't know you were taking
economics. Was there another bus besides ours?"</p>

<p>Stacy waved enthusiastically and smiled brightly. Tiffany's attention never
left the mirror bedecked stand of sunglasses near the booth they stood next
too. Quinn smiled gave a nervous laugh while Sandi mere scowled at the
approaching trio with her arms crossed in front of her.</p>

<p>"Oh they're not taking economics," remarked Daria with a smirk. "They don't
offer it to Freshmen."</p>

<p>"Then what are they...Quinn" stated Alex with an unpleased expression.</p>

<p>Stacy's smile vanished quickly at the unpleased tone in Alex's voice and she
lowered her head to gaze attentively at her designer shoes. Quinn did similarly
and clasped her hands behind her and fidgeted where she stood. Tiffany
continued to examine her reflection completely obliviously.</p>

<p>"Whatever," stated Sandi with disdain as she turned away from Alex, Daria
and Jane.</p>

<p>"Oh you guys wouldn't understand the responsibilities of the popular," Quinn
answered dramatically.</p>

<p>"I swear you just want to get grounded for life. Mom is gonna have kittens
when she finds out you ditched school to come here," Alex observed.</p>

<p>"Are we ready to leave," asked Sandi impatiently.</p>

<p>"Just about," answered Daria. "We need to let Mrs Bennett know that we've
got our own ride back to Lawndale."</p>

<p>"Um.. you're not going to tell her about us being here are you?" asked Stacy
worriedly.</p>

<p>"Don't worry your empty little head," replied Daria condescendingly. "We've
got a cover story that should ensure no one finds out about your little
unapproved outing."</p>

<p>"Yeah, we'll just tell her that my brother had a gig in the area and is
giving us a ride back with the band," informed Jane.</p>

<p>"Fine," stated Sandi. "Grant is parked on the Chartreuse section of the
parking deck on this level."</p>

<p>"We'll be there," acknowledged Daria as she and Jane turned to head back to
the elevators.</p>

<p>"Let's go Pip," announced Alex which drew another worried expression from
his youngest sister.</p>

<p>"No argument," he stated with authority. "You're gonna be in enough trouble
without making sure you get back home."</p>

<p>"Plus that makes sure you three don't just ditch us," reasoned Daria.</p>

<p>The two groups parted ways with a fuming Sandi casting a scathing glare
behind her at Jane and the Morgendorffer siblings.</p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>

<hr size=1 width="100%" noshade color=gray align=center>

</div>

<p>After again reaching the ground floor, the Alex and Jane met up with the
larger portion of their class and teacher. They quickly informed Mrs. Bennett
about making arrangements for their own ride back to Lawndale. Alex also gave
Charles a brief run down of the goings on and made plans to hang out depending
on whether Daria and Jane still planned on having their usual bad movie viewing
the next night, since it was a Saturday.</p>

<p>"Everything's kosher," stated Jane as she and Alex rejoined Daria and Quinn
near the escalators furthest away from the meeting place Mrs. Bennett had set
for the students to gather for their departure.</p>

<p>"Can we go now?" asked Quinn angrily.</p>

<p>"Almost," answered Daria as she began to walk away from the escalators.
"There's one more stop we need to make."</p>

<p>A loud splash drew everyone's attention as Alex, Daria Jane and Quinn moved
through the central section of the mall. They stopped and turned towards the
large fountain in the center of the mall to see Kevin climb to his feet, while
still in the fountain, and stare out pleadingly at an irate Brittany.</p>

<p>"Why is he wearing swim trunks?" asked Quinn as she noted that in place of his
usual uniform pants, the drenched quarterback wore a pair of yellow and blue
shorts with no pockets.</p>

<p>"But Babe, It was shrinkage!" he pleaded.</p>

<p>"Ooooo!" huffed Brittany angrily as she turned and stormed away from her
waterlogged boyfriend.</p>

<p>"Just keep walking," advised Daria as she began walking casually away from
the disturbance.</p>

<p>"Avoid eye contact kid," stated Jane as she and Alex followed Daria.
"They're dead to us now."</p>

<p>The four walked past the spectacle and Daria stopped in front of the Fuzzy
Wuzzy Wee-Bit Shop. The other member of the group stopped and glanced at each
other for a moment.</p>

<p>"What are we doing here?" asked Alex with a raised eyebrow.</p>

<p>"Trying to induce a cuteness based sickness so you can make the trip back
without worrying?" teased Jane.</p>

<p>"Actually," began Daria with a brief glare at her friend. "I wanted to use
this before we left."</p>

<p>The auburn haired girl pulled her coupon out of her coat pocket and
displayed the $20 slip for the Fuzzy Wuzzy Wee-Bit Shop.</p>

<p>"It should just about cover an on sale limited edition collectable," she
remarked as she glanced through the glass store front at the sign near the
collection of plush oddities which displayed $18.50.</p>

<p>Daria walked casually into the shop. Jane and Alex shrugged at each other
and followed her into the store trailed by Quinn.</p>

<p>As soon as Quinn entered the store, a loud siren went off and bright lights
began to flash. All four teens began to look around in shock and tried to
figure out what was going on.</p>

<p>"What the hell?" asked Jane as she looked around worriedly.</p>

<p>"I guess with all of the sickeningly cute things already here Quinn was too
much for the place and they've gone to Cutecon 1," remarked Daria.</p>

<p>As if in response, several people wearing shirts embroidered with the Fuzzy
Wuzzy Wee-Bit logo rushed up to Quinn and shoved the strings of a massive
bundle of balloons into one of her hands and began to enthusiastically shake
the other.</p>

<p>"What are you doing to my sister," Alex asked with a confused expression.</p>

<p>A similarly dressed middle aged man with a pin labeled "Manager" approached
and deposited an armload of miniature plush merchandise into Quinn's free arm.</p>

<p>"Congratulations little lady! You're our lucky ten-thousandth customer," he
announced in a cheery voice. "You've won the entire new line of Noah's Arc and
our original Fantasy Critters line of Wee-Bits for free!"</p>

<p>"The what?!" asked Quinn as she blinked in shock.</p>

<p>"Don't you get it?" asked the store manager. "You're our winner!"</p>

<p>"Winner?" asked Quinn disbelievingly.</p>

<p>"You know, it means the opposite of loser," quipped Jane.</p>

<p>"We're out of stock on the Fantasy line," informed the manager as he
extended a form towards the stunned red head. "But just give us your info and
we'll have it shipped to you address from the main distributor."</p>

<p>"Um..." expressed Quinn as she glanced at the sheet of paper and then at her
occupied hands.</p>

<p>"You said you're her brother right?" the man asked, his attention on Alex.</p>

<p>The boy gave a nod and the man instructed, "You fill this out while we get a
picture of our winner here."</p>

<p>"Um, OK," the boy replied still not recovered from the surprise of the
situation.</p>

<p><i>'I can't wait to find out how she's going to explain this to Mom and Dad
when that stuff arrives,' </i>thought Daria as she wandered further into the
store in search of an available member of the store's staff.</p>

<p>"Everyone say 'Wee-Bit'," the man said as he stood next to Quinn with a
brightly decorated sign that read '10,000th Customer' while another staff
member with a camera snapped a photograph.</p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><i>

</i></div>

<p>Jake lounged on the living room couch with a martini in one hand and his
other arm around Helen's shoulder as they watched a movie.</p>

<p><i>'I'm so glad we managed to wrap up the Heckland case early,' </i>thought
Helen as she shifted her legs to a more comfortable position under her on the
couch. <i>'Means I can spend a relaxing weekend at the house for a change.'</i></p>

<p>"I haven't watched this movie in years," stated Helen as she set the remote
down by the Movie Shack case. "It's one of my favorites."</p>

<p>"I know honey," affirmed Jake as he sipped his drink. "I figured it'd be a
great way to help you relax since you don't have to work this weekend."</p>

<p><i>'What the hell does that mean?!' </i>Helen almost vocalized before she
realized that her husband had said it without malice and was still completely
relaxed and smiling, with his eyes on the television. It had simply been an
observation, not an accusation.</p>

<p>'<i>One of these days I'm going to figure out what I did to deserve this
man,' </i>she thought as she snuggled closer to Jake and kissed his cheek.</p>

<p>"You know Jake," Helen said to catch his full attention. "Quinn's got her
Fashion Club meeting tonight. Daria and Alex are going to Jane's for their Bad
Movie Night..."</p>

<p>"Bad Movie Night? Aren't they too young to be watching those kinds of
movies?!" " he asked with shock in his voice.</p>

<p>"Not those kinds of bad movies Jake," Helen clarified. "The kind that aren't
very good. Like Xanadu and those old Ed Wood films..."</p>

<p>"Xanadu?! Ewwwww," expressed Jake with a disgusted expression.</p>

<p>"Anyway," continued Helen in attempt to get things back on topic. "Alex and
Daria will be out with Jane, and Quinn is going to Stacy's for a Fashion Club
meeting..."</p>

<p>"Oh yeah!" said Jake, having obviously forgotten.</p>

<p>"And I'm off this weekend so it's just going to be the two of us tonight..." Helen
continued breathily. "Alone."</p>

<p>"Oh yeah," the man rumbled quietly as he set his drink down and looked into
his wife's face with a lecherous grin.</p>

<p>At that moment, the couple's attention was drawn by the ring of the
doorbell.</p>

<p>"Dammit!" swore Jake at the interruption.</p>

<p>"I'll get it Jake," Helen stated with a sigh as she thumbed the pause button
on the VCR's remote, stood and walked to the door.</p>

<p>She opened it to see Jane's smiling face standing on the porch.</p>

<p>"Oh hello Jane," the woman said with a genuine smile of her own. "What
brings you over?"</p>

<p>"Hey Jane-O!" greeted Jake enthusiastically from the couch as he recovered
his glass and refilled it from the pitcher resting on the coffee table.</p>

<p>"Hey Mr. and Mrs. M," replied Jane. "Just here to pick up the kids."</p>

<p>The sounds of heavy footfalls came from the steps. Helen turned to see her
eldest children coming down the steps.</p>

<p>"Hola amigos," greeted Jane. "We ready to go?"</p>

<p>"Ready..." stated Daria.</p>

<p>"...and raring," finished Alex.</p>

<p>"You kids have fun," announced Jake as he picked up the remote and turned
his attention back to the television.</p>

<p>"That's the general idea," remarked Alex as the three walked out of the
door.</p>

<p>As they headed towards the side walk the noticed a young man in a brown short
sleeved shirt and shorts uniform heading towards the house with two large boxes
on a wheeled cart. The three stepped aside and nodded to the man as he wheeled
his delivery past them.</p>

<p>"I hope Dad didn't order any more of those 'exotic spices' online again,"
commented Daria.</p>

<p>"Seriously," agreed Alex as the three began their walk toward Howard Drive.
"It took two days to air out the kitchen the last time he tried to cook with
them."</p>

<p>Helen watched her children and their friend continue on their way and waited
for the delivery man to finish his own trip down their walkway.</p>

<p>"Golt a delivery for 111 Glenn Avenue. Mogen..Morgan..." stated the young man
as he struggled with the name.</p>

<p>"Morgendorffer," replied Helen with a sigh as Jake joined her at the door.
"What is this?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me lady. I just deliver it," he answered as he held out a
clipboard with a chain attached pen. "Sign here."</p>

<p>Helen quickly put her name to the delivery sheet as the delivery passed the
two boxes off to Jake, who set them inside beside the door. He then handed a
large envelope to Helen and headed back to his truck after a tip of his brown
cap to the couple.</p>

<p>"Fuzzy Wuzzy Wee-Bit Shop," said Jake as he read the large print on the
envelop over his wife's shoulder. "What the hell is a Fuzzy Wuzzy Wee Bit?"</p>

<p>"No clue," replied Helen as she opened the envelope and withdrew a letter
and a large 8x10 photograph.</p>

<p>She read a small portion of the letter then looked at the picture with a
distinctly displeased expression.</p>

<p>"Quinn Anne Morgedorffer, get down here this moment!" shouted Helen.</p>

<p>A worried Quinn exited her room with without a glance toward the open door
of Daria's own padded room. If she had, or even bothered to care about the
contents of her sister's room, she might have noticed the plush Alien
face-hugger draped menacingly over the top edge of Daria's computer monitor.</p>
