<P>The future. The year 2034 to be exact. Much has changed since the last<BR>
century and still is changing in ways we can't even<BR>
imagine. What follows is the tail of two cities. Well, one satellite<BR>
town of L.A. called Lawndale, and MegaTokyo. The<BR>
Megalopolis. The center of the world at the time. In the year 2025, the<BR>
Second Great Kanto Earthquake engulfed the city into<BR>
a blazing holocaust. Damage in the billions. Over 8 MILLION dead. It<BR>
seams as though it were a miracle that the city was<BR>
saved. Saved by the hands of Genom, the corporation which has now<BR>
become one of the greatest powers of the world. The<BR>
city rose from its ashes to become the great jewel it is today with<BR>
great technological wonders. More specifically, the<BR>
boomers.<BR>
The boomers, or cyberdroids, were originally designed to gather<BR>
resources from space. They have now become capable of<BR>
becoming a new race far superior than humans. Boomers now fight man's<BR>
wars and serve the purposes of most technological<BR>
labor on Earth. Chairman Quincy, of Genom hides his true ambitions. He<BR>
seeks the ultimate prize. The world under command of<BR>
Genom, and he is very close to this goal.<BR>
Aside from these goals, boomers have also been known to malfunction and<BR>
head on rampages and kill anyone whom gets in<BR>
their path. For the task of preventing such a crisis, the A.D.(ADVANCED)<BR>
Police was created to handle rouge boomers<BR>
with high technology and weaponry. There is only one flaw. The A.D.<BR>
Police are rather incompetent and end up with high<BR>
fatalities.<BR>
As Genom has spread to influence every part of the globe the American<BR>
branch has drawn its attention to a town called<BR>
Lawndale. Their purpose is to destroy the area of Lawndale in order to<BR>
create a Genom research and development site. They<BR>
shall first, though, manipulate those with feeble minds and low<BR>
reasoning and consolidate them into the ever devouring<BR>
conglomerate. And in Lawndale, the ignorant are in huge numbers and ripe<BR>
for the feast.<BR>
In both nations, the smart have learned of Genom's ambitions. In<BR>
Lawndale, high-school student, Daria Morgendorffer along<BR>
with elder brother Ross, discovered the shocking secrets of Genom<BR>
through their fellow members of a high-tech vigilante<BR>
organization until they became among the last of their organization<BR>
through a Genom assault on the country-wide outposts to<BR>
retrieve stolen information, and the slaughter of their leaders by an<BR>
unknown source. Determined to expose them for what<BR>
they are, Ross and Daria set out through their hometown in order to form<BR>
The New Corsairs.<BR>
<BR>
Dr. Kishigato Stingray, a rich scientist, was the father of boomer<BR>
technology. Aside from that, He was also a loving father<BR>
of his two children, Sylia and Mackie Stingray. Dr. Stingray was then<BR>
robbed of his life by Brian J. Mason, Vice president of<BR>
Genom. His lab was burned and his children were orphaned. Sylia would<BR>
later receive a data unit which downloaded all of<BR>
Genom's secrets into her mind. Among them were the hardsuits, extremely<BR>
durable and advanced body armor. Now in her<BR>
early adulthood, She and three other women, Priss, Linna, and Nene, have<BR>
joined to form the high tech mercenary/heroes<BR>
The Knight Sabers.<BR>

<BR>
EPISODE ONE: A TALE OF TWO CITIES<BR>
<BR>
CHAPTER 1: A CALMING RAIN,SIDED WITH KEROSENE.<BR>
<BR>
LAWNDALE CALIFORNIA<BR>
DECEMBER 2, 2033<BR>
It was late in the evening. The heavy rain accompanied the bitterness of<BR>
the night. The San Gabriels were usually undisturbed at this time of<BR>
night. It's surprising even by the fact that the mountains are silent in<BR>
this era of progress. Where cybertechnology and the corporate ways<BR>
dominate the way of life. The only outpost of the new era was a<BR>
warehouse. This warehouse belonged to the Gulf and Bradley Corp. The<BR>
second largest conglomerate on Earth. The largest, had its name also<BR>
inscribed on the building's entrance sign, a name which is well known,<BR>
well respected, and feared. Genom. Ever since the Gulf and Bradley corp<BR>
joined forces with Genom, Genom CEO Quincy has been a very happy man.<BR>
Genom now held 78% of the world's cars and gasohol(21st century<BR>
replacement for gasoline). Not only that, but with this move on his huge<BR>
chessboard, he has won favor of U.S. Congress and has allowed him to<BR>
replace the Genom tower that was destroyed in Chicago by an orbital<BR>
particle beam satellite, due to an &quot;accident&quot;. The same was in
New York,<BR>
Berlin, and Sydney. He is once again triumphant. These matters are now<BR>
put aside and we return to the warehouse. It was a fairly medium<BR>
structure, that is until it received an unexpected visitor. A large<BR>
tank-like battlemover rushed toward the facility, shattering its<BR>
steel/titanium door as though it were a thin sheet of ice on a warm day.<BR>
With the vehicle's dramatic entrance, its hatch popped up and out sprung<BR>
a cloaked figure. The figure drew out a member pistol and surveyed the<BR>
inside for cameras or any security devices. None. The figure removed its<BR>
cowl, Revealing the face of Daria Morgendorffer. &quot; What exactly is
the<BR>
point of all this?&quot; She asked. &quot;This is about as dangerous as
it is to<BR>
pick a penny off the ground.&quot; A voice came from the vessel's interior.
&quot;<BR>
Despite that maybe a mouse crapped on the ground and then you get the<BR>
Hanta virus.&quot; Jane then climbed out of the machine. &quot;I think it's
one of<BR>
Ross' little ideas. The public will be shocked to have this happen in<BR>
our little town and break out in panic.&quot; &quot;Even though this is
just a<BR>
little warehouse? I doubt that even Lawndale's that gullible.&quot; &quot;On
the<BR>
other hand..&quot; Jane added. &quot; The town will be screaming and running
in a<BR>
panic, and fleeing from the Corsairs, the threat to American<BR>
productivity and world civilization'. And with that big sweaty dumb<BR>
football players will want to protect their sweaty blunt cheerleader<BR>
gals and we make our retrieval.&quot; Daria looked through her thoughts
to<BR>
find sense in the whole plan. &quot;I'll just do this for the fun of seeing<BR>
terrified civilians at the market and fighting over Triscuits.&quot; Jane<BR>
smiled and pulled out a little device. It shot out into 8 little laser<BR>
projectors all rotating and tracing in a pattern into the concrete<BR>
floor. The concrete now had the design of a boomer's skull, and a<BR>
shotgun/sonic drill crossbands. At the bottom of the design was the word<BR>
CORSAIR. Within a few minutes Daria and Jane drove off leaving the<BR>
warehouse a bright inferno.<BR>
<BR>
CHAPTER 2: IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF OMNIPOTENCE.<BR>
MEGATOKYO, JAPAN<BR>
<BR>
Midnight in MegaTokyo. A nation of it's own really. Unlike the rest of<BR>
Japan, MegaTokyo has the largest ethnic melting pot of anywhere in Asia.<BR>
Hell, no where else in the world can compare to this techno-jungle. It's<BR>
almost ironic that six centuries ago, anyone who fit the description of<BR>
a &quot;gaijin&quot;, except Dutch traders would find themselves without
a head.<BR>
Now MegaTokyo is loaded with more gaijins and gaijin/Japanese hybrids.<BR>
Despite these differences, all these people share one thing in common.<BR>
The tower. The immense cylinder/pyramid arcology of Genom. It is to the<BR>
Empire State building or even Petronas Towers as is a man to a number<BR>
two pencil. If traveling from top to bottom in an elevator, one might<BR>
notice how sprawling the tower was to the little insects below. Almost<BR>
as though it were swallowing the city up. For the super conglomerate,<BR>
this was no illusion. They had control of almost every sense of the<BR>
Japanese government . Gift giving and bribing the puppets in the Diet<BR>
and robbing the country blind yet they still want more. At the summit of<BR>
the tower, through the smoked glass windows, an imposing man looks out.<BR>
Even though he is near sixty five years old, to those who care not to<BR>
watch what they say, would believe him to be the devil himself. This is<BR>
Chairman Quincy. &quot;It was once said that only gods could ascend these<BR>
heights. Mortals who dared to neglect their edict, would parish and<BR>
suffer the extreme consequences.&quot; The old man smiled slyly. &quot;All
is so<BR>
true.&quot; He returned to his desk in the near empty office which rivaled<BR>
the quarters of any great ruler. He discovers two message discs just<BR>
sent into him this evening. He went along and popped the first disc into<BR>
a slot which activated a wide screen T.V. on every side of the room. It<BR>
contained a broadcast of Neo L.A. News of a burning building. Young<BR>
anchorwoman, Shinobi Yamazaki informed the masses. &quot;This small community<BR>
of Lawndale is in a state of concern as this<BR>
warehouse behind me burns into oblivion. This building stored 45,000<BR>
optics accessories for<BR>
boomer manufacturing.&quot; &quot;This information isn't even worth its
speak.&quot;<BR>
Quincy growled. &quot;Why do the fools at international affairs bother to<BR>
even look at this unessential garbage?&quot; The broadcast continued. &quot;The<BR>
only evidence that can be recognized is this design engraved in<BR>
concrete. At the sight of the design Quincy's interest turned to it. He<BR>
was not in the least bit concerned but turned his attention to it<BR>
anyway. &quot;Corsair..... A name connected with the Hou Bang Corp. It is<BR>
nothing . Just a thorn at my side.&quot; He destroyed the file with little<BR>
care. He glanced at the second one<BR>
and played it. This time he scowled and his face darkened a little. &quot;And<BR>
yet, another thorn at my side.&quot; This image was of a security camera
at<BR>
the new GPCC building at Ukyo. His tested fusions between BU12 standard<BR>
battle boomers and 55C combat models had ended in failure. All thanks to<BR>
the Knight Sabers. They seemed so insignificant 3 years ago. Though he<BR>
doesn't want to admit it, The four armored women are more like a sliver<BR>
than a thorn.<BR>
<BR>
CHAPTER 3: LAWNDALE LIFE IN A SPIT BUCKET.<BR>
LAWNDALE CALIFORNIA<BR>
He slept on the couch the night before. He would have gone to the<BR>
basement, but felt queasy like always. Besides it wouldn't be too much<BR>
trouble for his mother to spruce it up into a real room. That is if she<BR>
hadn't been making claims of how hard she worked when her assistant had<BR>
been doing her work and working for a check which she got only 25% of.<BR>
His dad would probably do so. Yeah right. If he did he'd probably scare<BR>
off the decorator, try to do it himself, and end up dressed by a<BR>
mortician. Ah hell, it didn't really matter. His family's house sure<BR>
beats life in Yokohama seven years ago. All was tranquil until the<BR>
silence of Ross Morgendorffer's peace was sacrimented. &quot;Ahhhhhh!?!<BR>
&quot;Quinn! What is that around your waste!?!&quot; A typical debate of
the<BR>
Morgendorffer household. &quot;Mo-oom! Relax. It's only the latest trend!&quot;<BR>
&quot;Wow, the backwater Ethiopian tribeswoman look.&quot; responded the
16 year<BR>
old cynic, Daria. Quinn replied back insulted &quot;Uhg. For your<BR>
information Daria, this is a skort.&quot; Jake enthusiastically asked &quot;Wow!<BR>
Is it a skirt or a short? Ha!Ha!Ha!. Radical! Ha...Heh,heh..Heh,heh.&quot;<BR>
Everyone at the dining table just stared back at him. Jake cowered back<BR>
to his newspaper as usual. &quot;Alright,alright. I'm sorry I erupted like<BR>
that. I just think that that....ski...shi..whatever it is isn't it a<BR>
little revealing.&quot;<BR>
&quot;Wellllll,maybe, but according to Waif, people started wearing these<BR>
last year and...and..I know! Ross!&quot; Ross awoke completely and very<BR>
annoyed &quot;Oh fer the luv'v God! I'm on the Couch you don't have t'yell!&quot;<BR>
Quinn skipped the apology and went on to the subject &quot;Ross, you were
a<BR>
reporter, isn't this a new fashion trend?&quot; Ross analyzed the piece
of<BR>
fabric briefly &quot;Sorry, don't know any civilized nation who's teens<BR>
prance around in wash cloths.&quot; Quinn just frowned back at him &quot;Ross
for<BR>
once. Try to be supportive of your little sister.&quot;Helen scolded. Daria's<BR>
mouth tried to form words. Helen stopped her. &quot;And you too Daria!&quot;
Ross<BR>
replied. &quot;Sor-ry. I never covered fashion. I was an field reporter
for<BR>
Neo LA's department of international topics, not a photographer for<BR>
Victoria Secret's new velcro bra or whatever's hot these days. Besides<BR>
Mom, I thought it was that shirt...smo...thing that you were against.&quot;<BR>
Helen tried to find an argument. &quot;I am! I...Support that.....Well...Oh,<BR>
forget it. Quinn, keep the skort.&quot; Quinn smiled. &quot;I guess parents
just<BR>
know what being cool is after you show them.&quot; Daria replied. &quot;Guess
so.<BR>
Dad, can you crash the car someday? I want a cybernetic arm. The kind<BR>
where the wires hook into your brain.&quot; Jake laughed and took Daria<BR>
seriously. &quot; Sorry kiddo. You see, Daria, cybernetics look rad, but<BR>
they're dangerous. You can get what we call Boomer Syndrome. It's a<BR>
disease......&quot; Daria interrupted. &quot;That penetrates the brain and
causes<BR>
loss of emotions, compulsive lying, kleptomania, and murderous assaults<BR>
on human beings. Just as long as it doesn't kill me, I'll probably start<BR>
my war against mankind for it's flaws in life.&quot; Jake continued the<BR>
discussion of morals and techno ethics from what he knew, which had more<BR>
to do with &quot;No toys for sissy Jakey'. Real men use tools'. Helen head<BR>
off for her work on the Lanson/Mc Frugal Case, Quinn spent her time on<BR>
the video phone with Tiffany on the latest wears for 30 minutes, and<BR>
Ross......Ross was quiet. This was not unusual. He spent most of his<BR>
time thinking. Pondering about the past, present, and future. He was A<BR>
reporter then, a newcoming novelist now, and soon.....For most people<BR>
soon refers to the great blank space of time to be written. For Ross,<BR>
one thing was clear in present and in future. Revenge, what has now<BR>
become his life and his on-going quest. He looked around for a while.<BR>
Everyone else has gone for their everyday routine. Ross thought to<BR>
himself . &quot;Well, looks like it's time to fish for ideas.&quot; with
that,<BR>
Ross fell asleep. Within minutes he woke up from a couch to a metal<BR>
table. Ross examined himself. He was in dirt/ash covered casual clothes<BR>
and a black trenchcoat. He touched his face. His left side felt slightly<BR>
w the burns. On the right side of the face, Ross pulled back his hand.<BR>
&quot;Ow! Shit!&quot; His face stung from the broken glass stuck in his
face. Ross<BR>
looked around. It was mostly near pitch black. It was night fall.<BR>
&quot;Either this is a flashback and, or hallucination. Ah hell, I'll probably<BR>
discover something valuable if I play it through.&quot; Ross walked away<BR>
from reality. He was back in the apocalypse. Back in Yokohama.<BR>
<BR>
CHAPTER 4: ALL IN AN EVENING'S WORTH.<BR>
MEGATOKYO, JAPAN<BR>
Midnight. It was a later time than usual for her to arrive home, at the<BR>
Silky Doll. Who would ever think of the secrets that went on at the top<BR>
of a lingerie shop? The unknown life of the owner of this building? The<BR>
truth is only seven people know the enigma of Sylia Stingray. She had<BR>
come back from the reconstruction site of the the GPCC building. It had<BR>
been an exhausting fight. Sylia just decided to head on to bed. &quot;A
5CC<BR>
fused with a BU12.&quot; She thought to herself. &quot;Even if it was a
failure,<BR>
what does this mean for Genom? For us?&quot;. As she slipped into her silk<BR>
nightgown, she thought back. Back to the age of innocence. Dr. Kishigato<BR>
Stingray Was the Wiz laboratory's greatest achiever. He had successfully<BR>
discovered the revelation of scientific technology, the boomer. With<BR>
this new creation mankind would be able to achieve it's highest goals.<BR>
Reduce of manual labor, farming of the seas, and the colonization of<BR>
space. Dr. Stingray wanted to create a better world. To liberate mankind<BR>
from the plight of the earth. He wanted a world for his 12 year old<BR>
daughter, Sylia and little Mackie. What the good doctor didn't realize<BR>
was that he created another flock of sheep. The atom bomb, chemical<BR>
weapons, cyberdroids, they're all lost flocks who are divided between<BR>
shepherds. The Wiz laboratory became sponsored by a soon to be very rich<BR>
shepherd. A fairly successful corporation named Genom. They were<BR>
interested in the boomers. Sure, all talk of space colonization and<BR>
liberty from manual labor sounded good and the corporation would add<BR>
this to their goals, but a revolutionary machine like this, this could<BR>
be sold all over the world for every use. War, descry, prostitution<BR>
even, the globe could eat out of their hands. Of course a person like<BR>
Dr. Stingray would oppose to such things. Suppose however, Dr. Stingray<BR>
never invented the boomer and wouldn't be able to claim anything. April<BR>
13, 2022. A fire destroys the Wiz laboratory with Dr. Stingray inside it.<BR>
A dark chapter in Sylia's life takes place and the daughter and sister<BR>
must become the mother as well. Fortunately for her, the enormous<BR>
Stingray fortune wasn't lost and Mackie has grown into a<BR>
genius(perverted)teenager. One day a data unit came for her. Once she<BR>
gained access to it, information flooded her mind faster than a<BR>
lightning bolt. What truly happened to her father, Genom's ambition's,<BR>
and most importantly, the hardsuits. The hardsuits were a type of armor<BR>
unknown to any field of scientists, but those whom worked with Dr.<BR>
Stingray. Battlesuits or battle movers were usually bulky, large, and<BR>
manually controlled. Hardsuits contrasted by being humanly compact, and<BR>
with special innerware, could be controlled from a simple impulse from<BR>
the brain. This passed on to Sylia a new meaning for her life, to avenge<BR>
the death of her father. All she needed were some teammates who shared<BR>
her ambitions and money to spend on technology. The fiery and strong<BR>
Priss Asagiri, typical and athletic Linna Yamazaki, and sweet and<BR>
computer wise Nene Romenova. These three were to become her teammates and<BR>
adopted family. They emerged as the Knight Sabers, mysterious vigilantes<BR>
who oppose the savior of Tokyo and ominous threat of mankind. They work<BR>
as &quot;hired guns&quot; to their employers in return for prices in the
millions.<BR>
Sylia was pondering on the goals of the Knight Sabers. Priss lost a<BR>
lover,Linna's parents died in a boomer rampage, and Nene wants to be a<BR>
hero. To be exact, most of the Knight Sabers act on a quest of vengeance<BR>
and only one acts for the right thing. Was her father's work truly<BR>
worth fighting for? Boomers benefit humans in many ways and would<BR>
benefit even more if Dr. Stingray's legacy were carried, but boomers are<BR>
truly no more than a slave race that need equal treatment. To most<BR>
people this is bullshit. Boomers have no souls or true hearts. Then<BR>
again, most people don't know much about sexaroids, androids who are<BR>
near like us in every way, but people don't know that do they? All they<BR>
are is black marketed(Genom manufactured)sluts and playthings. Sadder<BR>
though, boomers can't truly be allowed freedom. Mankind will have a new<BR>
superior enemy to dominate the earth. Then again, are humans worthy to<BR>
their mother Earth? Does Darwin dictate the weak to parish? Too many<BR>
thoughts and questions. Sylia put these matters aside and drifted off to<BR>
sleep. Tomorrow was another day, and unknown to her, drastic events<BR>
occurring on the other side of the world.<BR>
CHAPTER 5: THE OVERESTIMATIONS OF STUPIDITY<BR>
LAWNDALE HIGH, CALIFORNIA<BR>
Jacob H. Chrichley entered the auditorium with sheer confidence and<BR>
superiority over the audience. &quot;Splendid.&quot; He mouthed sinisterly
. These<BR>
were the young people of Lawndale. Perfect. They all were either paying<BR>
close attention to him or chatting on about nonsense. They were all<BR>
stupid looking or pathetically excited. Especially the football player<BR>
still in his uniform smiling like the ignorant waste of space he was.<BR>
The older generations were probably just as ignorant as the youths.<BR>
&quot;I'll be Genom's vice president for sure.&quot;He thought. The speech
began.<BR>
&quot;Good afternoon, students of Lawndale High, and future achievers of
the<BR>
world.&quot; He was satisfied with the loud cheers that followed the words.<BR>
The words failed to please Daria Morgendorffer, Jane Lane, Michael<BR>
Andrews, and Mara Jacobs. &quot;Which percent of the room is he addressing?&quot;<BR>
Daria asked. Jane scanned the auditorium. &quot;He's talking to the cows.&quot;<BR>
&quot;The people who don't care about their health or the really happy ones<BR>
on their way to the beef factory?&quot; &quot;Can you guess which one awaits
the<BR>
icy cold hand of death and don't know it?&quot; &quot;96 percent?&quot;
&quot;Bingo.&quot;<BR>
Michael observed the dark haired man carefully. &quot;So he's Senator<BR>
Chrichley. I expected a 50 year old pervert. Well, looks are deceiving.<BR>
The perfect illusion. A young, &quot;cool guy&quot;, and with the people.&quot;
&quot;<BR>
Michael, is there somebody you're not telling me about?&quot; Mara joked.<BR>
Michael scowled while Mara chuckled and changed the subject. &quot;Seriously<BR>
though, you know who he is? You called him senator. Does that give Genom<BR>
the right to subpoenas?&quot; &quot;Fortunately no. Senator is just a nickname
given<BR>
to him because of his connections with Congress. This guy's a conniving<BR>
rat bastard. He's always hiding in the dark. He plots behind the U.S.<BR>
military forces and bribes whoever carries four stars and needs the<BR>
money for whatever they need. Fortunately, they don't have much luck<BR>
with the air force. He wants the whole country and maybe even reporting<BR>
directly to Quincy himself.&quot; Chrichley continued on. He introduced
the<BR>
whole idea of turning Lawndale into a pro Genom town. One of several<BR>
global towns which will be selected in order to make a better community<BR>
for everyone. Also Genom will take charge of special classes designed<BR>
for economics and Genom employee training. Chrichley added. &quot; And don't<BR>
think It'll be a typical class, This class will be by choice.&quot;<BR>
Daria was a little puzzled. &quot;It'll? What the hell is It'll?&quot; Jane<BR>
commented on the classes. &quot;At least they don't have any doggy treats
to<BR>
submit them to their will.&quot; Chrichley continued. &quot;By the way anyone
who<BR>
enrolls, will get a lifetime discount on Sports Shorts.&quot; Many of the<BR>
guys, especially Kevin whistled and cheered. Jane put her hand to her<BR>
head. &quot;Dammit.&quot; The speech went on. &quot;And remember, the people
of<BR>
tomorrow working for us is the greatest right we could have and life is<BR>
the greatest privilege you could ever receive. Any questions?&quot; Daria<BR>
raised her hand. She could take no more of this guy's crap. &quot;Yea, With<BR>
that slogan you stated, doesn't that say that Genom has the right of<BR>
it's employees and that life, being a privilege, gives you the right to<BR>
take those lives.&quot; Chrichley was stumped. &quot; Uhhh....Uh heh,heh.<BR>
Uhhh....Interesting thought. Well, umm.. That concludes this session<BR>
thank you for your time, and remember Sports Shorts discounts.&quot;<BR>
After the assembly. Chrichley met with Principal Li. She commented with<BR>
praise on the speech. Chrichley was pleased. He brought the matter of<BR>
Daria to attention. She replied &quot; Oh, don't worry about her. She is
a<BR>
bit troublesome in keeping this school's positive image. I'll settle the<BR>
problem fine.&quot; Chrichley replied. &quot;Ah, then everything is well,
I should<BR>
be off now. Till we meet again Ms. Li.&quot; After he left Principal Li
Was<BR>
about to call Daria's parents. She thought to herself. Mr. Morgendorffer<BR>
was a stupid and confused parent and Mrs. Morgendorffer. She'd hate to<BR>
be discussing lawsuit threats with that bitch. How dare she call her a<BR>
socialist. She remembered a note left by Mrs. Morgendorffer. If the<BR>
parents were not available call Daria's brother, Ross. Ross. Li's face<BR>
blackened at the sound of that troublemaker's name. What she would do to<BR>
forget Ross and his magnificent gang of four. Ah hell, He could've<BR>
changed. Could he? She dialed the phone to Ross' cellular.<BR>
CHAPTER 6: MILD BEGINNINGS FOR A LONE PSYCHO<BR>
TOKYO JAPAN, 2025<BR>
His face showed a rough ride to where he was that day. He just landed in<BR>
the hell that would be seven years of his life. Ross Morgendorffer<BR>
looked up to see the aftermath of the holocaust that hit. He only had a<BR>
few words to say. &quot;Oh, damn. Damn,damn,damn.&quot; He had just woken
up and<BR>
discovered an 8 day gap in his head. He knew who he was, who his parents<BR>
and two sisters were and his job, but what the hell was he doing in<BR>
Tokyo? What just happened to this city and how in God's name did he wind<BR>
up in a warehouse? He walked out a ways. The streets were cluttered with<BR>
refugees. The casualties of progress had to forget who they were and<BR>
turn to dependency of those even more dependent. Not Ross. This was his<BR>
own quest that no one in this country shared with him. One of the<BR>
homeless bums was actually doing well. &quot;Marijuana here. Get yer<BR>
Marijuana! Everything will go away in just a jiffy! Just one Puff!&quot;
Ross<BR>
crossed his path. The druggie saw an idea for a profit. He came up and<BR>
spoke.Ross detected a heavy Polish accent &quot;Hey man, you look like you<BR>
need a little weed. Want a vintage Roman Red?&quot; Ross replied back in
an<BR>
exausted voice. Beat it Druggie. I'm supposed to be on a United 797<BR>
sleeping after watching the digital remake of Titanic. Not some<BR>
....Some....My God... Where am I? &quot;Welcome to Yokahama.&quot; Said
the Pole.<BR>
&quot;Once the best real estate in all Tokyo, I guess you could call it<BR>
Yoko-shit hole. Bwah ha! Ha! Ross noticed the Druggie's merchendise<BR>
&quot;Sales aren't going well I take it by the looks of your bags and the<BR>
smoky stench on your all ready urine soaked pants from being in whatever<BR>
happened here.&quot; &quot;Hey man, it's ok. I get it all the time from
the<BR>
Yakuza. Which reminds me I am in desperate need of a new pair of pants.&quot;<BR>
Ross checked his wallet and handed him 50 yen. &quot;Wow, thanks I...&quot;
Ross<BR>
was turning back the bum raced to catch up with him. &quot;M'name's<BR>
Zeb..Wait! Where are you going?&quot; &quot;Sleep. I'm in despereate need.
Oh, and<BR>
my name's Ross.&quot; Ross returned back to the warehouse. It took him a<BR>
whole fifteen minnutes to sleep. The cries of those suffering haunted<BR>
him in the dark room. Women crying for their husbands and children and<BR>
vice versa. Some fathers would outlive their sons and little children in<BR>
their cribs would become bastards Their brothers and sisters left<BR>
innocence behind and take to the cruel streets of povery. Disturbing<BR>
thoughts indeed. Ross finally went to sleep...Wait a minnute... there<BR>
are murmurs and talks of unknown things going on. The weight of his<BR>
clothes suggests he's not been kidnapped by aliens . He tried to open<BR>
his eyes. He couldn't. Suddenly a surge of pain shot through his head.<BR>
He was blindly trying to move. Trying to scream.Trying to die. He could<BR>
not make any convulsions or see what was going on. Ross finally screamed<BR>
out to liberation from this pain.... and woke up in his house. He<BR>
searched around and sighed a sigh of relief. The celular in his pocket<BR>
started viabrating. He awnsered it. &quot;Hello, Mr. Ross Morgendorffer?
This<BR>
is Angela Li of LAWNDALE HIGH.&quot; &quot;Well, well, what can I do for
you<BR>
Madame Mao?&quot; &quot; It's now PRINCIPAL Li, Mr. Morgendorffer!&quot;
Ms. Li shouted<BR>
over the phone. &quot;Anyway this message concerns your sister Daria. During<BR>
an assembly speech by Genom she gave our speaker a rather smarmy remark<BR>
about their slogan. I would like to ask of you to consult her and try to<BR>
enrole her in retraining in self esteem class again. If not I shall have<BR>
to take actions myself.&quot; Ross smiled devilishy. &quot;Sure Ms. Li,
and just<BR>
for the fun of it , how bout I talk to my mother envolving the Dean<BR>
Scrotter crash that occured 15 years ago.&quot; Ms. Li was shocked &quot;How
the<BR>
Hell do you Know about that?!!&quot; &quot;Tisk,tisk Ms. Li. You shouldn't<BR>
carelessly leave important documents on your desk when you're away.&quot;<BR>
&quot;You...You son of a...&quot; &quot;Temper temper. Here's the deal.
Don't force my<BR>
sister in repeating self esteem and this can remain our little secret.&quot;<BR>
Ms. Li could not find any alternatives. &quot;All right. She won't repeat.&quot;<BR>
&quot;Thank's Ms. Li, Well I have work to do and you have your Lawndale<BR>
over-glorification to attend. Toodles Honey, call me when you find<BR>
Ambassador Duke.&quot; CLICK. Ms. Li simpely slammed her fist on her desk.<BR>
&quot;Damn the whole lot of em!&quot; Ross laughed at the little fiasco
over the<BR>
phone and checked his watch. &quot;12:34. I better get to Mc'Grundy's and<BR>
give the boys the good news.&quot; He could already imagine the look on<BR>
Jesse's face when he told him.<BR>
<BR>
CHAPTER 7: KEYS TO THE CLOSET.<BR>
SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA 3:45 A.M.<BR>
There was only the silence and the man clad entirely in black. Of course<BR>
the silence is never permantent. Good thing he wasn't wearing anything<BR>
that showed his national background or things would not be going well<BR>
back in the U.S. Still that didn't matter he was the intruder and<BR>
intruders get to be shot at by soldiers shouting in Korean. At least<BR>
they haven't noticed the file in his hands. He made a speedy getaway to<BR>
the safe zone on top of the 63 Building. Robert Parks. A Pacific<BR>
Islander / American agent of the C.I.A. and the top secret U.N. OP<BR>
squad. &quot;Damn these are getting easy he said smugly.&quot; He looked
at the<BR>
file just captured. &quot;We got ya now you multinationalist bastards.&quot;
He<BR>
made it later back to the states to meet an old high shcool friend.<BR>
&quot;Hello?&quot; Ross said. &quot;Ah yeah, wait there.&quot;He droped
the phone and went<BR>
into the living room of a fairly big 3 story house in California. &quot;Hey<BR>
Rob, it's for you....I think.&quot; &quot;Hello? Uh,yeah....I can be there
in<BR>
five minutes. Yeah, see'ya latter Joe.&quot; &quot;Ross! I gotta use you
other<BR>
car!&quot; Ross looked up from his paper&quot; I'm using the Porche later,
Mc<BR>
Grundy's is callin me.&quot; &quot;Blue Boar, eh Ross?&quot; &quot;Naw,
business.&quot; ....<BR>
With that Ross left their presence. He had to be their to deliver the<BR>
news to Trent and Jesse.<BR>
SHIROTARU CASTLE ,HOKKAIDO ISLAND, JAPAN.<BR>
The Man practiced in the Dojo. He was a strong figure. Imposing and<BR>
fierce. A look at him would detect a great deal of Russian decent.<BR>
Without a shirt he shows his Samurai spirit with the sinister demon<BR>
tattoo dominating his torso. This tattoo was his namestake which fitted<BR>
the Japanese/Russian hybrid well. Mamano Zhirinovsky, corporate assasin,<BR>
spy, samurai, and marksman combined to form Genom's greatest headhunter<BR>
and the one responsible for keeping the lid to all Quincy's dirty<BR>
secrets. &quot;Mr. Zhirinovsky.&quot; called the kimono clad manequin class<BR>
boomer. &quot;There's a call on the monitor.&quot; &quot;Tell them to call
back later<BR>
Madame Butterfly.&quot; The manequin replied. &quot;Sir, You really should
awnser.<BR>
It's from the chairman.&quot; &quot;What?&quot; Mamano asked. &quot;He says
it's about two<BR>
prizes.&quot; Said Madame Butterfly. Mamano's attention rose a bit. &quot;What
are<BR>
their names?&quot; &quot;Micheal Andrews and Robert Parks.&quot; &quot;How
much?&quot; &quot;According<BR>
to the chairman, 990million. Mamano grinned. &quot;Tell the chairman I'll
be<BR>
delighted.&quot;<BR>
CHAPTER 8: PLOTS AND PLANS 1<BR>
MC'GRUNDY'S BREW N' PUB<BR>
It was the typical afternoon crowd at Mc' Grundy's . Mystic spiral<BR>
practicing songs. Drunken reprobates drownt their sorrows. Happy people<BR>
drinking away because they were just so damned mucho contento. One of<BR>
Lawndale's best souls, rough n' tough Scotsman, Clancy Mc'Grundy was<BR>
like any typical bar owner who ran the place along with his son Scott<BR>
Cowen Mc'Grundy who aslo brewed coffee so finely. Scott came up to the<BR>
table of two of Lawndale's poor as dirt punks named Nick and Shane. Nick<BR>
was rambling on about the days he &quot;ruled&quot; the streets. &quot;Man,
I was the<BR>
best. Anyone who gave me shit would get an ass whoping. Any bitch who<BR>
gave me smack would get pimp slapped. I was the Greatest! I..&quot; Scott<BR>
interupted by splashing Nick tequila in his face. &quot;Oh, dinnae' be goin<BR>
along wi'all that bullshite'bout that! Look at yae! Yae probly spent all<BR>
the days in the bathroom wit' Victoria Secret!&quot; Nick was of course<BR>
angered. &quot;Hey shut up man! Once I get this gig completed, I'll be richer<BR>
than all you sons'a bitches! I'll get the old gang back together!&quot;
Trent<BR>
and Jesse chuckled. A voice interupted Nick. &quot;What the hell're you<BR>
talking about?&quot; Ross said as he entered. &quot;You never even had a
gang<BR>
Nick. You were lucky not to even be a gang member. Dante would..&quot; Nick<BR>
interupted again. &quot;If Dante got in my face I'd be all over his ass.&quot;<BR>
Ross argued back. &quot;You wouldn't even have time to flip him off. You<BR>
wouldn't and never will have anything to beat those techno-nazis.<BR>
Anyway, what's all this I hear about a gig?&quot; &quot;Non'na your business.&quot;<BR>
&quot;What do you mean none of my business?&quot; &quot;I mean that I'm
sposed to give<BR>
a data unit to some guys outside the Jericho freeway.&quot; He looked at
his<BR>
watch. &quot;Shit! I gotta get there. See y'all later jackasses.&quot; Nick
and<BR>
Shane left the pub not noticing a man with cybernetic replacements and a<BR>
tube going through his head who listened very closely. Ross sighed.<BR>
&quot;Outside Jericho Freeway. How stupid can people get.&quot; He focused
his<BR>
attention on Trent and Jesse. &quot;Hey Mr. Morgendorffer.&quot; Trent greeted.<BR>
Ross smiled back &quot;Please Trent, just call me Ross.&quot; &quot;So,
what brings you<BR>
here?&quot; Ross awnsered Trent. &quot;Just the usual. Blue Boar, hot wings,
and<BR>
results from the Mojave test.&quot; Trent listened with anticipation. &quot;The<BR>
results re back already?&quot; &quot;So what'd it say?&quot; Ross gave out
the<BR>
results. &quot;Well, despite the whole thing with the barrel and the farmers<BR>
complaining about the explosion and stealing crops, congradulations. You<BR>
passed.&quot; Jesse's eyes lit up. &quot;Whoah! You mean? We...&quot; &quot;Yup,
you passed.<BR>
You are officialy members of the Corsair society.&quot; &quot;Alright!&quot;
The duo<BR>
shared a high five. Ross just smiled. &quot;Kids. So enthusiastic these<BR>
days.&quot; Ross thought to himself.<BR>
CHAPTER 9: THIS IS YOUR BRAIN ON A STAKE.<BR>
JERICHO HIGHWAY, CALIFORNIA<BR>
The Jericho highway was once an ideal road to prosperity. It is now<BR>
desolated and abandoned from social dreams. The place has become a place<BR>
of refuge for the outcasts of a society that once believed that it was<BR>
the damned coolest thing to rip out your eye and replace it or amputate<BR>
your arm and get a bitchin metal one. People who have sense never<BR>
approach it. Nick and Shane on the other hand don't have a whole lot.<BR>
&quot;Shit. They said they'd meet us right here. It's been five hours.&quot;
Shane<BR>
noticed some spray paint on a road sign. &quot;Hey Nick and buddy. Look<BR>
behind you.&quot; They followed the instrutions to a shocking display. Their<BR>
contacts were strapped to their own truck with chains. Their bodies,<BR>
bloody and mutilated. &quot;Hey buddy boys!&quot; Called a voice suprising
them.<BR>
&quot;You really shouldn't be out here anytime day or night.&quot; &quot;You
see, we<BR>
don't take very kindly to your kind.&quot; Nick asked shuddering.<BR>
&quot;Wha...What the hell do you want from me.&quot; &quot;Ha! Ha! Ha! It's
not exactly<BR>
what I want with you. It's what does he want with that.&quot; Nick looked<BR>
around for what the voice would be looking for. &quot;I'm talking bout the<BR>
data unit you f*cing<BR>
prole! Now. If you want him to spare your lives do exactly what I tell<BR>
you. Go into the truck's back door and lay the data unit right in the<BR>
middle and he will not kill you.&quot; Nick and Shane entered reluctantly<BR>
into the pitch dark truck. They followed the intructions and let out a<BR>
sigh of relief. &quot;Now, what do I do I want with you?&quot; &quot;What?&quot;
Shane<BR>
asked. &quot;Thank's for volenteering to go first.&quot; Out of no where,
a flash<BR>
of blackish-blue came from out of the floor and Shane's last visions<BR>
were a thing with red eyes, teeth and cutting him up alive. Nick<BR>
frantically ran from the truck only to be stopped by a tall black man<BR>
with a bald head, cybernetic eye and cybernetic arm. &quot;I see you met
my<BR>
colleuge Shrapnel. He's a little on the morbid side, but it turns out to<BR>
be an excelent sacrifice. And what a day it shall be tomorrow. The<BR>
VT3455 and the orca shuttle touching down outside Malibu.&quot; He picked
up<BR>
Nick who was petrefied with fear. Nick timidly asked &quot;A....re you .<BR>
Him?&quot; &quot;Why yes. I am he. I am the great srevent to our benvolent
savior,<BR>
who will slaughter the ones whose gluttoney shall become their<BR>
damnation. I am Dante. Dante the Chosen.&quot; Nick was tossed in the air<BR>
landing on his oppressor's knee and last saw his head being torn from<BR>
his body. That's when he saw crimson. Then shortly, nothing.<BR>
CHAPTER 10: PLOTS AND PLANS 2<BR>
MC'GRUNDY'S BASEMENT.<BR>
Everyone was present and accounted for. Daria, Jane, Trent Jesse, Mara,<BR>
and Micheal were all there. Ross began the session. &quot;Good evening.
May I<BR>
have your attention please ?&quot; Daria replied &quot; You can have the<BR>
attention, but no deal with intrest.&quot; &quot;Don't worry Sis, this won't
take<BR>
long.&quot; Daria sighed. &quot;Yeah, despite the fact that you've taken
enough<BR>
time waking up from Happy Pre St. Patricks Day. At least Trent and<BR>
Jesse are awake.&quot; She thought to herself. Ross went on. &quot;Every<BR>
orginization, every society is based on a foundation. Some even reinvent<BR>
themselves to find the very thing which brings forth a new and greater<BR>
devotion. Something which would....&quot; Daria wished Ross not to take
his<BR>
sweet time. &quot;Get to the damn bottle!&quot; &quot;Uh, right. Ahem! Sorry,
sorry.<BR>
This is our foundation.&quot; Ross approached a well locked safe and oppened<BR>
it, carefully taking out a wine bottle. Trent and Jesse were unappealed.<BR>
&quot;That's it? Just a whine bottle?&quot; Ross went on. &quot;Yes. Just
a bottle of<BR>
wine. A bottle of wine that the truly ambitious go after.&quot; Trent and<BR>
Jesse were puzzled. Ross continued. &quot;Thousands of years ago a special<BR>
type of wine was extracted from the grapes of the mediterrainian. A wine<BR>
which legend says is the taste of pure victory. Alexander the Great<BR>
drank it before conquering the world. A popular treat at The Last<BR>
Supper. Lord only knows how many times the Roman emporers have guzzled<BR>
over it. To save the world from conquerers a band of French knights,<BR>
monks and nuns bottled the final one in 1132 AD and dubbed it Le<BR>
Victoire. From that moment on many have stole the bottle to gain a sip<BR>
of godhood. Famous amongst these, Nepoleon Boneparte, Benito Mussolini<BR>
and finally, Adolf Hitler. All recovered and the stealer suffers bitter<BR>
failure.&quot; Micheal felt the need to ask. &quot;What does Le Victoire
have to<BR>
do with Genom?&quot; Daria awnsered. &quot;The current orginizers of Corsair
felt<BR>
that Quincy, knowing of the legends, would attempt to buy the wine from<BR>
us. No deal. Since then we declaired Genom our enemy and have stolen<BR>
secrets in order to publicize their crimes. Our leaders obtained<BR>
something important from them. Later on, last year Genom got their<BR>
revenge.&quot; Ross aided the speech. &quot;Most all were interrogated or
killed.<BR>
Many were not even 15. Our leaders were in Versailles, but somehow, they<BR>
got to them , and blew them to bits with the orbital sattilite weapon.<BR>
So Daria and I, being the only survivors, left to make Genom think they<BR>
had won.&quot; Ross was silent for a moment and finished. &quot;So in their<BR>
memory, we went on to create from what was destroyed.&quot; The subject
was<BR>
averted to another time to speak of other matters. &quot;So nobody panicked<BR>
about the warehouse.&quot; Daria awnsered with sarcasm. &quot;Oh yeah. The
streets<BR>
were rioting with cries of prophecies and damnation.&quot; &quot;Dammit!
I should<BR>
never take stupid people for grantite.&quot; Cursed Ross. &quot;I was hoping
This<BR>
would get simple and we'd just steal the code at Taylor's house.&quot; Jesse<BR>
asked back. &quot;What code?&quot; Jane enlightened him. &quot;The original
plan was to<BR>
steal a certain code from Brittany Taylor's house. Her dad was recently<BR>
employed as part of the Enginerium Corporation, another puppet of Genom.<BR>
The code would've unlocked the location of the new GPCC archives<BR>
facility. Feeling that it would be easier to obtain with Brittany's<BR>
parents outta town, and her making out with Kevin in a social state of<BR>
Chaos. Ross instead is in our presence hitting himself.&quot; Ross stopped
to<BR>
recollect his thoughts. &quot;Shit, shit shit. It looks like it may be time<BR>
to arrange Plan B.&quot; Daria was hoping it wouldn't come to this. &quot;You<BR>
don't mean..&quot; &quot;Yep, during the upcoming spring break next year
and<BR>
possibley continuing in the summer, we're going to have to personally<BR>
look for the GPCC within several contestant locations in the Eastern<BR>
Hemisphere. The ideals are unknown at the present time except one. The<BR>
others will be given as soon as my friends at the C.I.A. and MI6 learn<BR>
more. But until then, tell your parents...&quot; &quot;We're going to Tokyo.&quot;
Said<BR>
Daria when she got back home. &quot;Tokyo huh?&quot; said Helen with excitement.<BR>
&quot;I'm going along with Jane over the spring break and the summer. Trent's<BR>
got a gig going down at some club called Hot Legs.&quot; &quot;Wow! That's
great<BR>
Kiddo!&quot; Quinn was shocked. &quot;Whaaat?! You can't go! I'm going their
with<BR>
the fashion club! My chances of winning the Kawasaki Spring Fling are<BR>
ruined!!&quot; Helen was also curious about Quinn's affairs. Ross enlightened<BR>
his mother , disgusted. &quot;It's a cheap little sham made to see which<BR>
girls have the smoothest and creamiest of legs and brains and make an<BR>
honorary mannequin of them. Sorry, sis but I have to go to. I have to<BR>
recall some thoughts for my book sales.&quot; Oh, No!&quot; Daria reassured
her.<BR>
&quot;Relax, it's the largest city on Earth. I doubt we'll even come close
to<BR>
meeting each other.&quot; Helen let the optimism shine through. &quot;Well,
I<BR>
think it's wonderful that you three get such a great oppertunity to do<BR>
something more constructive than moping about eggplant pants or who<BR>
deserves to die soon or who caused my suffering.&quot; All three siblings<BR>
frowned at Helen. &quot;What'd I say?&quot; Ross put the matter aside. &quot;Anyway,
I<BR>
made dinner for this occasion. It's a simple yet exotic food that I<BR>
invented during my days of survival in the streets. I present ...&quot;
Ross<BR>
presented the most unappitising looking dish. &quot;Slurry.&quot; Jake,
disgusted<BR>
yet hiding it. &quot;Well, we're quite the master cook. So what's in it.&quot;<BR>
&quot;Herring, tuna, blubber, squid ammonia, squid, Octopus, shark<BR>
clasper, more varied seafood, and a ton o preservatives and<BR>
disinfectives. Go on and taste. It's like solami....Except it's soupy.&quot;<BR>
Jake decided to give it a go. It was a mistake. He was frantically<BR>
trying to find the nearest sink, but didn't quite make it. Helen ,<BR>
Quinn, and Ross both tried to escort him. &quot;Jake! Not the glass coffee<BR>
table! I Washed it last Sunday!&quot; &quot;Dad, try not to swallow the
bones!<BR>
They'll just make you cough up more.....oh dammit.&quot; &quot;EEEEEEEWWWWWWW!!!<BR>
MOOOM! MY NAVY BLUE SHORTS!!!&quot; Daria hid a laugh.<BR>
THE END.<BR>
(DON'T THINK THAT THE END OF THE STORY ENDS THE SAGA.)<BR>
