The Daria Blooper Series<br>
<br>
Remember: Daria stands as the trademark, exclusively to MTV &amp; Viacom. Now let's carry on.<br>
<br>
(The crying scene in Fat Like Me when Sandi reveals the truth to Quinn)<br>
<br>
Director: Action!! (Sandi and Quinn stare like a couple of zombies) Action, girls, action!!<br>
<br>
Sandi: We don't know any action!! All the script lady told us was to cry like babys and say some dumb words.<br>
<br>
Director: That is what action means--just say the dumb words.<br>
<br>
Quinn: Why didn't you say so....?<br>
<br>
Director (muttering in despair): Union break......!!<br>
<br>
<br>
(Another try at the crying scene in Fat Like Me)<br>
<br>
Director: Action!!<br>
<br>
(Sandi begins crying)<br>
<br>
Quinn: What's wrong, Sandi?<br>
<br>
Sandi: Nothing. It's just....oh, Quinn, I love you so much!!<br>
<br>
(both girls are now crying as Quinn hugs Sandi)<br>
<br>
Quinn: Oh, Sandi, I love you, too!!<br>
<br>
(Suddenly Tiffany steps into the room, carrying a tray of sandwiches and sodas)<br>
<br>
Tiffany: Who ordered the baloney on rye and the tuna on wheat?<br>
<br>
Director: CUT!! Tiffany!! Your scene doesn't come till later!!<br>
<br>
Tiffany: But I only came to make a lunch delivery for those two. (points to Sandi and Quinn)<br>
<br>
Quinn I got the tuna on wheat.<br>
<br>
Sandi: And I got the baloney on rye. (Both girls get up to get their food)<br>
<br>
Director: Union break.......!!<br>
<br>
<br>
(The ending scene in Pierce Me where Helen and Jake confront Daria, to Quinn's delight, when Daria shows her midriff)<br>
<br>
Helen: Quinn, what's the matter with you?!?<br>
<br>
Jake: Your sister's not tattooed--no, I mean pregnant--no, I mean bloated.....oh, GAH DARNIT!!!!!!<br>
<br>
Director: CUT!! Jake, you forgot your lines again?!?<br>
<br>
Jake: Sorry (blushes)<br>
<br>
Helen (to Jake): Jake, what is the matter with you?!?<br>
<br>
Jake: So I forgot my lines, big deal!!<br>
<br>
Director: Oh, rats.....!! It ain't my bloody day......!!<br>
<br>
Daria (to Quinn): So, you wanna go for burgers?<br>
<br>
Quinn: OK.<br>
<br>
<br>
(The last scene in Pierce Me, when Quinn says her closing line)<br>
<br>
Quinn: She was pierced, pierced, I tell you!! Oh, death, where is my sting? NO, that ain't it!! What was my line again?<br>
<br>
Director: CUT!! You too, Quinn?!?<br>
<br>
Quinn: Sorry. (blushes) Union break.....!!<br>
<br>
Director: Hey, that was my line........!!<br>
<br>
Quinn: Sorry again......<br>
<br>
(The hot tub scene in Daria Dance Party, when Stacy bemoans her pruney palms, when Sandi scolds her for it)<br>
<br>
Sandi: Stacy, that is so unattractive, I CANNOT believe you even showed me!!<br>
<br>
Director: And.....cut!!<br>
<br>
Tiffany: 'Bout time. We were getting waterlogged in that water.<br>
<br>
Director: Uh, sorry, girls, we've got to shoot the scene again--the boom microphone got in the shot.<br>
<br>
Sandi, Tiffany &amp; Stacy: WHAT?!?<br>
<br>
<br>
(Another take on the hot tub scene)<br>
<br>
Director: And......action!!<br>
<br>
Sandi: You're in time out for a long time so keep your head down or I'll bust your spine with a sledgehammer!!<br>
<br>
Director: CUT!! That ain't in the script!!<br>
<br>
Sandi: Sure it's in the script!! See? (Shows the director her copy of the script)<br>
<br>
Director: WHAT?!!? Which one of you jokers changed the script?!? Was that you, Stacy?!?<br>
<br>
Stacy: Not me!!<br>
<br>
Tiffany: Me neither.<br>
<br>
(Behind the bushes we see Kevin holding his nose to stop from laughing)<br>
<br>
<br>
(The piercing scene in Axl's shop in Pierce Me when Trent offers his hand to Daria)<br>
<br>
Trent: I'll help you through that, Daria, It's my hand. Take it, it's clean.<br>
<br>
(Daria takes Trent's hand and recoils when she gets axle grease from it)<br>
<br>
Daria: UGH!! I thought you said it's clean!! I got axle grease!!<br>

<br>
Sandi: Payback time for what you did to my script......<br>
<br>
<br>
(The scene in The Invitation when Quinn runs out to tattle on Daria)<br>

<br>
Director: And I thought directing Beavis &amp; Butt Head was that bad............<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
Jesse: I'll get another cramp.<br>
<br>
Director: CUT!! It's supposed to be A MINOR 7th first, THEN A DIMINISHED!!<br>
<br>
Jesse: Sorry. Guess we got our signals crossed.<br>
<br>
Jane (to the Director): You've got to forgive the guys, they've been touring for months, to the point when they can't think sane.<br>
<br>
Director: And what're they touring as, Spinal Tap?<br>
<br>
Trent: No, Mystik Sprial, but we're changing the name.<br>

Kevin: We got tired of that one so we'd thought try something different.<br>
<br>
Brittany: Besides, that other tune's so corny.<br>
<br>
Daria: I'll buy that.<br>

<br>
Director: CUT!! That was the wrong card!!<br>
<br>
Jane: I'll say!! (to Daria) Did you stick on the wrong card?<br>
<br>
Daria: Not me. Did you?<br>
<br>
Jane: Nope. (to Ms. Defoe) Did you?<br>
<br>
Defoe: Nonsense, why would I do such a thing?<br>
<br>
(Tim O'neil comes up)<br>
<br>
O'Neil: I switched the cards, because I felt vomiting dinner was so.......yuccy.<br>
