the voice is that of her brother<br>
Trent singing......)<br>
<br>
SCIENCE FICTION LAWNDALE FEATURE<br>
Parody of Science Fiction Double Feature<br>
Performed by Trent Lane<br>
<br>
Trent:<br>
Angela Li was ill the day Lawndale stood<br>
still, yet she told us....where we stand<br>
and Stacy Rowe was there buyin' new<br>
underwear;<br>
Upchuck was The Invisible Ham.<br>
<br>
Then good luck came when<br>
we all played at the Zen;<br>
it was a cool major big grungefest jam<br>
Jesse picked up the pace;<br>
Max was in, outer space,<br>
and here is how Nick's message ran:<br>
<br>
(Here Jane's mouth turns to black and<br>
white while the credits change)<br>
<br>
Trent:<br>
Science fiction, Lawndale feature<br>
Janet Barch, will build a creature<br>
See Daria and Tom, escape from<br>

Trent and Jane Lane come, from<br>
their home planet.<br>

Quinn Morgendorffer<br>
(Daria's sister)<br>
<br>
(Back to color Jane's mouth turns to<br>
while Trent's singing resumes)<br>
<br>
Trent:<br>
I know sweet Brittany Taylor, was no<br>
bimbo failure, when her beau Kevin<br>
took, to the hills<br>
And it was a big pain, when my pop<br>
Vincent Lane lost his silver nitrate fluid<br>
that kills.<br>
<br>
Sandi Griffin, it proves, gave Quinn the<br>
ruse, in usin' her Fashion Club skills.<br>
"But when brains collide," said Tom<br>
Sloane to his bride, "I wanna give you<br>
some cynical chills, like a--"<br>
<br>
(Again Jane's mouth is black and white<br>
for the last set of credits)<br>
<br>
Trent:<br>
Science fiction, Lawndale feature<br>

Claire Defoe (The art teacher &amp;<br>
narrator)<br>
Janet Barch (A hypocritical male<br>
hating teacher turned scientist)<br>
Tim O'Neill (A creature teacher)<br>
Kevin Thomson (A football star)<br>
Brittany Taylor (Kevin's groupie)<br>
<br>
(We see, at a Roman Catholic church, a wedding<br>
finishing up,and at one point, we see in the<br>
crowd, Jane and Trent, muttering their statements.<br>
Right now, all the groups make ready for a<br>
standard photo.)<br>
<br>
Andrea: Here they come!!<br>
<br>
(Out from the church come Mack and Jodie----the<br>
bride and groom,as if you didn't know. They meet<br>
up with the group for the photo.)<br>
<br>
Vincent Lane: Let's get a shot, you all..........<br>
say POO POO!!<br>
<br>
All: POO POO!!<br>
<br>
Vincent: Congrats!! Now I can bring home the bacon<br>
for my Mandy!!<br>
<br>
(We see Mack talking with Tom Sloane)<br>
<br>
Mack: Well, I guess Jodie got her way. At least<br>
now, I don't have to hear that Kevin call me<br>
Mack Daddy.<br>
<br>
Tom: I feel for you. Guess Quinn's advice on<br>
popping the question to Jodie reaped dividends<br>
for you.<br>
<br>
Mack: Maybe they'll work for you and Daria.<br>
<br>
Tom (stammering): W-welll, I don't know.......<br>
I am a meat an' potatoes dude, an' Daria's into<br>
burgers........<br>
<br>
Jodie: Here comes the bouquet!!<br>
<br>
(The Lawndale cheerleaders cheer and jump wildly;<br>
Jodie makes the toss; and it falls in Daria's<br>
hand.)<br>
<br>
Daria (deadpan): Whoopee. I got the bouquet.<br>
<br>
Mack: Hey, man, looks like you're the next<br>
victim.<br>
<br>
Tom: That action's nowhere. It's one thing for<br>
me an' Daria to date;it's another when it comes<br>
to marriage.<br>
<br>
Mack: Time to bust a move to Niagra. Peace out,<br>
all of you!! Let's go, Jodie!!<br>
<br>
(Jodie and Mack's car drives off, everyone but<br>
Daria and Tom chasing it; our protagonists walk<br>
through the graveyard past a sign reading,<br>
"Lawndale, The Home Of MTV Animation.")<br>
<br>
Daria: S-O---------our school prez was once,<br>
plain 'ol Jodie Landon, now she's Ms. Jodie<br>
Jordan.<br>
<br>
Tom: You got to admit, Mack can be a lucky dude.<br>
<br>
Daria: At least he don't have to worry ' bout<br>
Jodie callin' him Mack Daddy.<br>
<br>
Tom: You sure it ain't Daddy Mack? Oh.......<br>
speaking of lucky.......<br>
<br>
DAMMIT DARIA<br>
Parody of Dammit Janet<br>
Performed by Tom Sloane &amp;<br>
Daria Morgendorffer<br>
<br>
Tom:<br>
Hey Daria.....<br>
<br>
Daria:<br>
What Tom?<br>
<br>
Tom:<br>
I got somethin' to say.<br>
<br>
Daria:<br>
What?<br>
<br>
Tom:<br>
I love the way you just stand like a zombie<br>
for that bouquet.<br>
<br>
Daria (blushing):<br>
Oh Tom.<br>
<br>
Tom:<br>
The Daria show rules, but it's all over (Daria)<br>
Canceled an' gone forever (Daria)<br>
So please, don't say that you love Trent (Daria)<br>
I've just got one thing to say an' it's Dammit,<br>
Daria, I love you.<br>
<br>
(Daria smirks while Tom turns his back to her)<br>
<br>
Tom (continued):<br>
Jane Lane loved me but you stopped it. (Daria)<br>
The fires of my love is small so you fan it. (Daria)<br>
If there's one Daria pairing, that is it. (Daria)<br>
I've just got one thing to say, an' it's Dammit,<br>
Daria, I love you.<br>
Here's a ring that proves I ain't no slacker<br>
There's four ways that love can go<br>
Beavis, Butt Head, Aeon Flux an'you<br>
Oh, D-A-R-I-A, I LOVE you so!!<br>
<br>
(After Tom places the engagement ring on her<br>
finger, Daria runs in the church with Tom in tow)<br>
<br>
Daria:<br>
Oh it's so nicer than my pierced navel. (Oh Tom)<br>
Now we're engaged an' we'll raise hell (Oh Tom)<br>
An' you're better than that slacker Trent Lane (Oh Tom)<br>
I've one thing to say, to that effect, Tom,<br>
I love you, too, oh......<br>
<br>
(Daria and Tom walk down the aisle)<br>
<br>
Tom:<br>
Oh dammit!!<br>
<br>
Daria:<br>
Oh Tom.<br>
<br>
Tom:<br>
Oh Daria.<br>
<br>
Daria:<br>
For you.<br>
<br>
Tom:<br>
I love you too.<br>
<br>
Daria &amp; Tom:<br>
Just one thing left to<br>
do-------ah--------ooooooooo......<br>
<br>
Tom:<br>
So let's see your cousin--I mean your sister.(Daria)<br>
The redhead that acts like a twister. (Daria)<br>
She's so popular, yet loves to panic. (Daria)<br>
I just got one thing to say, an' it's Dammit,<br>
Daria, I love you.<br>
Dammit, Daria.<br>
<br>
Daria:<br>
Oh,Tom, your mom.......<br>
<br>
Tom:<br>
Dammit, Daria.<br>
<br>
Daria &amp; Tom:<br>
I love you.....<br>
<br>
(The two kiss; yes, even Daria, as cynical as<br>
she is, can have feelings too.......)<br>
<br>
CHAPTER 2: Party hearty blues<br>
(The scene changes to the art room of Lawndale<br>
High, where, among the paintings and a world<br>
globe, is the art teacher, Claire Defoe, who<br>
speaks to the audience/reader)<br>
<br>
Defoe: Wassup? Yowsa, sweetie. I would like,<br>
uh, if I may, to take you on astrange journey<br>
that is more surrealistic than the paintings of<br>
H.R.Giger. It seemed to be a run of the mill<br>
night when Daria Morgendorffer and fiance,<br>
Tom Sloane, went on that late November night,<br>
to head back to their hometown of Lawndale,<br>
to meet up with Daria's sister, Quinn<br>
Morgendorffer, the popular sweetie face,<br>
and vice president of Lawndale High's Fashion<br>
Club.<br>
<br>
(Defoe inspects some of Jane's paintings,<br>
and reads through an art book.)<br>
<br>
Defoe (continued): It's true there were dark<br>
storm clouds, heavy and black, than the ones in<br>
Salvadore Dali, towards where they were heading.<br>
It's true also, that Tom had five flat tires in his<br>
car--and one of them was the spare, but, the fact<br>
they were brains in love, and on a night out.....<br>
well, they weren't allowing a storm foul up the<br>
events of their evening, were they?<br>
<br>
(Defoe stares in the camera eye for effect)<br>
<br>
Defoe: On a night out......it was a night out<br>
they were going to remember.....for a long<br>
time.......<br>
<br>
(The rain starts to pour, when Tom's car reaches<br>
a sign that reads, DEAD END--and that is when all<br>
four tires go flat----POW!! POW!! POW!! POW!!)<br>
<br>
Tom: Oh, great, four flat tires!! And what's worse,<br>
we must've taken a wrong turn!!<br>
<br>
Daria: Another triumph for the fickle finger of<br>
fate.<br>
<br>
Tom: Least you got your cell phone your lawyer mom<br>
gave you.<br>
<br>
Daria (stammering): Cell.....phone.........?!?<br>
I knew there WAS something I forgot!!<br>
<br>
Tom: Oh foo!! (hits the back of his head with his<br>
hand) It couldn't get any worse; all we can do now,<br>
is hope for the boogey man to end our miseries.<br>
<br>
Daria: Maybe Dr.Who may show up and we can hitch a<br>
ride on his Tardis.<br>
<br>
Tom:What's that up ahead?<br>
<br>
(To the left, is a huge citidel, the size of The New<br>
York, New York hotel &amp; casino in Vegas, resembling the<br>
cylindrical glass towers of the Los Angeles Hotel<br>
Bonaventure, but with four black fork shaped twin<br>
smokestacks, belching orange smoke in the<br>
black stormy sky, flanking the center glass tower.)<br>
<br>
Daria: Offhand, I'd say it's one of those mirage<br>
buildings you hear of on Sick Sad World.<br>
<br>
Tom: Only one way to be sure. Wait here, they may<br>
got a phone I can use.<br>
<br>
Daria: Don't leave me alone, I wanna come with you.<br>
Besides, it's how horror films start that way.<br>
<br>
Tom: True, but it's how comedy films start out that<br>
way.<br>
<br>
Daria:Tell that to Hollywood.<br>
<br>
(The two, sheilding themselves with newspapers from<br>
the rain, head to the citidel, approaching the high<br>
wall and the open gate, a few signs on it reading,<br>
BEWARE OF CASA BARCH!! NO USELESS MALES ALLOWED!!<br>
ENTER @ YOUR OWN RISK!! Along the way, Daria and<br>
Tom burst into song.)<br>
<br>
OVER AT THE SCARY OLD PLACE<br>
Parody of Over At The Frankenstein Place<br>
Performed by Daria Morgendorffer, Tom<br>
Sloane &amp; Trent Lane<br>
<br>
Daria:<br>
In the ol' man winter<br>
of an avarage night,<br>
burnin' bright, there's a guidin' star.<br>
Yet it ain't Gwen Stephani.<br>
<br>
Daria &amp; Tom:<br>
There's a light......<br>
over at the scary old place.<br>
There's a light......<br>
Brightly shinin' in N-space.<br>
There's a light, light makin' like some ol'<br>
UFO spacecraft gem.<br>
<br>
(Inside the citidel, seeing the approaching<br>
duo, dressed like Riff Raff, from a window,<br>
is Trent.)<br>
<br>
Trent:<br>
<br>
<br>
Could that gal be the one I dated before ago?<br>
Nah, couldn't be, must've slept for so long,<br>
oh no<br>
Imagination, imagination......<br>
<br>
Daria &amp; Tom:<br>
There's a light........over at the scary old<br>
place<br>
There's a light.........<br>
Brightly shinin' in N-space.<br>
There's a light, light, we follow to the<br>
next storyline here, now.<br>
<br>
(Back to Lawndale High; we see Defoe inspecting<br>
Jane's artwork she did of the anoerexic girl for<br>
the story Arts &amp; Crass.)<br>
<br>
Defoe: "She knows she's a winner, she couldn't<br>
be thinner, now she goes to the bathroom and----"<br>
(Startled, she turns to the camera) Oh!! I forgot<br>
you were here....sorry.....(composes herself)<br>
And so it seemed that the MTV execs had<br>
smiled on Daria and Tom, and that they had<br>
found the help they sought........(close up,<br>
while Defoe raises an eyebrow)........or<br>
HAD they.........?<br>
<br>
(We see several cars parked near the wall.<br>
At the base of the citidel, Daria and Tom<br>
stand before a huge blast door)<br>
<br>
Daria: Uh......Tom, maybe I should stay with<br>
the pile of junk you call a car.<br>
<br>
Tom: A bit late for that. I admit, whoever<br>
lives here, must be eccentric.<br>
<br>
Daria: Must be that Celine Dionne, married<br>
name unknown who lives here. Everyone hates<br>
her now, so she's got to have a safe place.<br>
<br>
(The huge door opens, and Trent greets the two.)<br>
<br>
Trent: Yo.<br>
<br>
Tom:Listen, the name's Tom Slone, an' she's<br>
Daria Morgendorffer, which is German for<br>
"morning town." Can we use your phone? We've<br>
got four flat tires on my car a few miles behind.<br>
You got a phone we can use?<br>
<br>
Trent: You're wet. (laugh/coughs)<br>
<br>
Daria: Well, duh, it's raining........!!<br>
<br>
Trent: Good one. (laugh/coughs) I think you<br>
two best come inside.<br>
<br>
Tom: Thanks, or somethin' like that.<br>
<br>
(He and Daria enter, with Trent in tow.<br>
The interior of the place starts out with what<br>
looks like those antique stores, only with neon<br>
signs, clocks, arcade machines, gas pumps, and<br>
other pop culture stuff. Ahead,we see a stairway,<br>
to the left, a set of double doors, marked with<br>
The Doors logo, and in the center of the room,<br>
a cylindrical tube elevator the size of a freight<br>
elevator; other than that, its decor is similar<br>
to the interior of the RHPS house, but with the<br>
stuff mentioned above.)<br>
<br>
Tom: What a place......!!<br>
<br>
Daria: Must be early Pee Wee's Playhouse.<br>
<br>
Trent: Follow me, please. (He leads Daria and<br>
Tom to the double doors.)<br>
<br>
Daria: We saw a lot of cars parked out there;<br>
is there a party in the works?<br>
<br>
Trent: You've arrived on a rather special night;<br>
it's one of our mistress'affairs.<br>
<br>
Daria: Whoop de do. Lucky her.<br>
<br>
(Trent's sister Jane, wearing the Mangeta maid<br>
uniform and black thigh highs,arrives with a<br>
paintbrush and a palette, and leans on the<br>
stairway bannister.)<br>
<br>
Jane: You're lucky, he is lucky, I am lucky,<br>
we're ALL LUCKY!! (laughs) Yo, you two wanna<br>
pose for my next painting?<br>
<br>
(Just then, Trent notices one of the neon<br>
clocks, then grabs his electric guitar,which<br>
is equipped with a wireless FM transmitter,<br>
patched into his amplifier, and strums it.)<br>
<br>
THE SPIRAL WARP<br>
Parody of The Time Warp<br>
Performed by Trent &amp; Jane Lane,<br>
Claire Defoe, Brittany Taylor &amp; The<br>
Lawndalians<br>
<br>
Trent:<br>
It's astoundin'<br>
Fame is fleetin'<br>
Critics take their toll<br>
but listen closely----<br>
<br>
Jane:<br>
Not for rather much longer.<br>
<br>
Trent:<br>
Mystik Sprial.......is the soul.<br>
<br>
(Trent does his Riff Raff dance while<br>
playing his guitar.)<br>
<br>
Trent:<br>
I remember, doin' The Sprial Warp.<br>
when we, jammed at The Zen<br>
Our luck then was fallin'<br>
<br>
Trent &amp; Jane:<br>
Till good fortune came callin'............<br>
<br>
(The doors open, to a ballroom, where we see<br>
dozens of our fave Lawndalians--Sandi, Tiffany<br>
and Stacy, a.k.a. The Fashion Club, The 3 J's,<br>
Jake and Helen, Vincent and Amanda Lane, the<br>
Lawndale High faculty, The Lawndale High<br>
cheerleaders, Dr. Philips from Ill, the Guptys<br>
from Pinch Sitter, much of the Lane clan, and so<br>
forth--dance. On the stage at the far end, we see<br>
the rest of Mystik Sprial--Jesse, Nick and<br>
Max--play, along with Monique on a synth system.)<br>
<br>
The Lawndalians:<br>
Let's do The Sprial Warp again.<br>
Let's do The Sprial Warp again.<br>
<br>
(The scene changes to Claire Defoe's art<br>
room, where she points out a diagram of a<br>
guitar)<br>
<br>
Defoe:<br>
It's just a strum to the left.<br>
<br>
(Back to the ballroom)<br>
<br>
The Lawndalians:<br>
An' then a strum to the right.<br>
<br>
(Back to Lawndale High)<br>
<br>
Defoe:<br>
With your Ampeg amps plugged.<br>
<br>
(Back to the ballroom)<br>
<br>
The Lawndalians:<br>
While playin' outa sight<br>
an' with those decibels,<br>
it's sure to drive you insane<br>
Let's do The Sprial Warp again<br>
Let's do The Sprial Warp again.<br>
<br>
Jane:<br>
It's so dreamy, but MTV freed me.<br>
Canceled by the bigwigs, I saw it all.<br>
In a matter of moments, we were out of work.<br>
Now forgotten? Not at all.<br>
<br>
Trent:<br>
So MTV gave our pink slips<br>
<br>
Jane:<br>
Right after our last quips<br>
<br>
Trent:<br>
And we'd never get our show back again.<br>
<br>
Jane:<br>
Let's protest to the nation.<br>
<br>
Trent:<br>
For our reputation!!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Lawndalians:<br>
Let's do The Sprial Warp again.<br>
Let's do The Sprial Warp again.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(At that moment, Brittany, dressed up like<br>
Columbia, complete with a top hat, jumps off<br>
the juke box she's been sittin' on, and does<br>
her thing.)<br>
<br>
Brittany:<br>
Well I was walkin' down the street with<br>
no shoes on my feet<br>
Me an' Kevvy just-a kissin', so discreet<br>
then along came Janet Barch and co.<br>
They broke up our hijinks<br>
then hired us, to be their servants<br>
Me, a dancer, Kevvy a janitor.<br>
<br>
The Lawndalians:<br>
Let's do The Sprial Warp again.<br>
Let's do The Sprial Warp again.<br>
<br>
Defoe:<br>
It's just a strum to the left.<br>
<br>

Defoe:<br>
With your Ampeg amps plugged.<br>

it's sure to drive you insane.<br>
Let's do The Sprial Warp again.<br>
Let's do The Sprial Warp again.<br>
<br>
(Here, Brittany does the RHPS tap dance<br>
sequence, right up to when she falls;<br>
Daria does her Mona Lisa grin.)<br>
<br>
The Lawndalians:<br>
Let's do The Sprial Warp again.<br>
Let's do The Sprial Warp again.<br>
<br>

Let's do The Sprial Warp again.<br>
Let's do The Sprial Warp again.<br>
<br>
(Monique plays a descending synth portamento<br>
coda while the Lawndalians along with Trent,<br>
Jane and Brittany fall to the floor.)<br>
<br>
Daria: Uh, Tom, say something.<br>
<br>
Tom: Diarrhea, cha, cha, cha, Diarrhea,<br>
cha, cha, cha----oops, wrong show......<br>
<br>
Daria: (sigh) Least what we saw ruled.<br>
They oughta play at The Zen.<br>
<br>
Nick: You hear that, man? A new<br>
<br>
challenge for The Sprial.<br>
<br>
Max: Oh boy!! We're criminales, ready to<br>
take on the big time!!<br>
<br>
Jesse: Cool.<br>
<br>
Monique: Amen.<br>
<br>
Trent: I'll buy that.<br>
<br>
Tom: If I were a phone, where would I be?<br>
<br>
Daria: Next to The Yellow Pages. Let's ask<br>
that butler where it's at.<br>
<br>
(No sooner do Daria and Tom make a move,<br>
there is a big humming sound behind them;<br>
the elevator is the source, meaning it's<br>
descending and indeed it does. The doors open,<br>
and out steps Janet Barch in a satin black cape,<br>
walking disdianflully past the male Lawndalians,<br>
till she stops before Daria and Tom.)<br>
<br>
OL' CRUEL TEACHER<br>
Parody of Sweet Transvestite (ugh!!)<br>
Performed by Janet Barch<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
How'd you do, I<br>
So you met my,<br>
useless, loser man.<br>
<br>
(Barch points to Trent)<br>
<br>
Barch(continued):<br>
He's just a lazy slacker<br>
because, when you knocked,<br>
he thought you were the,<br>
guitar man.<br>
<br>
(Barch struts along the ballroom floor)<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
Don't get turned on, by the way I look<br>
I am tough just like Danny Glover<br>
I ain't a kind teacher by the light of day,<br>
but at night, I am one HELL of a lover!!<br>
<br>
(Off comes the cape, revealing Barch in a black<br>
satin Merry Widow bustier, with black thigh highs.)<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
I am just an ol' cruel teacher<br>
from my home state of,<br>
Pennsylvania.<br>
<br>
(Barch gives a rude raspberry in disgust to Tom,<br>
then turns to Daria)<br>
<br>
Barch(to Daria):<br>
Your boyfriend's scummy<br>
like my spouse, so crummy<br>
but you, look like you're oh so groovy<br>
If you want somethin' visual,<br>
it ain't so abysmal,<br>
we could take in an old k.d. Lang movie<br>
<br>
(Aware of Barch's hatred of males, Tom nonetheless<br>
steps up to her, with Daria at his side)<br>
<br>
Tom: At least we found you at home........<br>
<br>
(Tom points to Daria and gently nudges her to Barch)<br>
<br>
Tom(continued):<br>
........can she use your phone?<br>
We're both in a bit of a hurry.<br>
<br>
Daria:<br>
Right.<br>
<br>
(Tom casually starts to back away)<br>
<br>
Tom:<br>
She'll just stand by your side, while I wait outside;<br>
we don't wanna be any worry.<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
Well you got stuck with a flat?<br>
Well.......how 'bout that?<br>
Well, stupids------don't you panic!!<br>
By the light of the night, it'll all<br>
seem just right; I'll get you a strong<br>
female mechanic!!<br>
I am just an ol' cruel teacher<br>
from my home state of,<br>
Pennsylvania.<br>
<br>
(Barch makes her way to a throne near the stage,<br>
and settles down; Jane,Trent and Brittany place<br>
themselves 'round the throne, Barch glowering at<br>
Trent from time to time, to Jane's disdain----I<br>
made it ryhme!!)<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
So why don't you, stay for the night?<br>
<br>
Trent:<br>
Night.<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
And maybe, a bite?<br>
<br>
Brittany:<br>
Bite.<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
I could show you, my latest, obsession.<br>
I've been makin'a wimp, that don't act like<br>
a gimp, and he is good for my male hatin'..........<br>
tension.<br>
I am just an ol'cruel teacher<br>
from my home state of,<br>
Pennsylvania.<br>
LET'S HIT IT!!<br>
I am just an ol' cruel teacher.....<br>
<br>
Trent, Jane &amp; Brittany:<br>
Ol' cruel teacher.........<br>
<br>
(Barch walks back to the elevator)<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
..........from my home state of,<br>
<br>
Trent, Jane &amp; Brittany:<br>
Pennsylvania.........uh huh.......<br>
<br>
(Barch turns to Daria and Tom)<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
So---------come up to my lab----<br>
An' see what's on my slab----<br>
<br>
(Barch directs her next words to Daria)<br>
<br>
Barch (continued):<br>
I see you fightin'......off antici------------<br>
<br>
Jane, Trent, Brittany &amp; The Lawndalians:<br>
SAY IT!!<br>
<br>
Barch (continued):<br>
---------pation............<br>
But our acid rain,<br>
just ain't really to blame,<br>
so I'll remove your brains.......<br>
<br>
(Barch snickers)<br>
<br>
Barch (continued):<br>
.......but not.....your talent!!!!<br>
<br>
(Barch stabs a button on the elevator's control panel,<br>
and the door slams with a hiss; the elevator car goes up<br>
to who knows where. At that moment, Trent and Jane bring a<br>
pair of privicy screens for Tom and Daria; behind one's own<br>
screen, the two change. After that, Daria is now in her<br>
standard sleep wear, while Tom is in a t shirt and briefs.)<br>
<br>
Tom: Uh, the name's Tom Sloane an' she's my babe,<br>
Daria Morgendorffer.<br>
<br>
Brittany (twirling her pigtails): Uh, you're lucky to be<br>
invited up to Ms. Barch's lab; she only allows priviliged<br>
people up there.<br>
<br>
Tom: You've seen it?<br>
<br>
Brittany (blushing): An' more........eep!!<br>
<br>
Daria: Sounds like she's the new model for Victoria's<br>
Secret.<br>
<br>
Trent (laughing/coughing): Good one, Daria. (Starts to usher<br>
Daria and Tom into the elevator) Let's go, Ms. Barch don't like<br>
to be kept waitin'.<br>
<br>
Jane: MOVE IT!! (Then in a timid way) Sorry. I've been hangin'<br>
with Barch for too long.<br>
<br>
Daria: It's OK. Whoever that Barch is, she's like Ming The<br>
Merciless getting in touch with his feminine side.<br>
<br>
Tom: That is, if he had one.<br>
<br>
Trent: Good one. (He and Jane laugh. After that, they all<br>
enter the elevator; the door closes, and the elevator<br>
heads up to the upper level.)<br>
<br>
Tom: Time well spent, I think.<br>
<br>
Daria (to Trent): Is Barch you wife?<br>
<br>
Brittany: EEP!!<br>
<br>
Trent: She used to be married, until her spouse ran out<br>
on her. Since then, she's been hatin' any an' all males,<br>
even me. But in my POV, she never will BE married; we're<br>
just her....minions.<br>
<br>
Daria: Sorry I asked.<br>
<br>
Jane: Good one (laughs)<br>
<br>
CHAPTER 3: Happy birthday, Skinny!!<br>
<br>
(The elevator door opens, and the group steps out into a<br>
vast red tiled room with an upper gallery with ramps and<br>
stairs; right now, we see the Lawndalians there, overlooking<br>
the activities at hand. Below, surrounding the perimiter of<br>
the room, we see some statues of female Amazon warriors,<br>
passages leading to different rooms of the building. Across<br>
from the elevator is a curtained doorway. At the right hand<br>
part of the wall is a huge control panel with digital LED<br>
clocks for the different time zones of the world, along with<br>
TV screens, computer keyboard units, switches, buttons,<br>
levers, LED read outs, printers, and so forth. Next to that,<br>
on the panel's right hand side, is another blast door,<br>
stenciled with UNIVERSAL PROTOTYPE DEEP FREEZER #541 CAUTION!!<br>
ABSOLUTE ZERO!! In the center of the room, is a huge Cres-Cor<br>
Crown-X 7 foot tall electric heating cabinet, used for heating<br>
restraunt food, now with several insulated electrodes sticking<br>
out from the top; above that, hanging from the ceiling, is a<br>
series of electrodes, a 5 foot gap between those, and the<br>
ones on the Cres-Cor cabinet. And standing near it, adjusting<br>
its onboard controls, in a white smock, is Barch, who turns<br>
to Daria and co.)<br>
<br>
Barch: Jane, Brittany, go help your loser Trent. I will<br>
entertain.<br>
<br>
Tom: Uh.....the name's Tom Sloane, and she's Diarrhea<br>
Morgendorffer.<br>
<br>
Daria: "Daria."<br>
<br>
Barch: SHADDAP, YOU!! OR ELSE!! SHEESH!! (calms down)<br>
It ain't often we get visitors here, let alone offer our<br>
hospitality. But if there is one thing I CANNOT stand,<br>
is (points to Tom) a MAN!! (belches rudely)<br>
<br>
Tom: Never mind the sexist hatred!! We don't give a hang<br>
'bout what goes on here, but we asked you to use your phone,<br>
which you don't care 'bout!!<br>
<br>
Daria: Tell me all 'bout it.<br>
<br>
Barch (to Tom): How STUU-----PID of you.....such a ugly<br>
parasite of a man. So useless!! (To Daria) You must be out<br>
of your mind to hang with....a MAN!!<br>
<br>
Daria: I try from time to time.<br>
<br>
Trent (to Barch): We're ready.<br>
<br>
Barch: Then let's get started. (to Daria and Tom)<br>
Follow me.<br>
<br>
(Barch, Daria and Tom head to the giant control panel,<br>
where Trent, Jane and Brittany wait. From there, Barch<br>
turns to the Lawndalians above in the upper part of the<br>
room and addresses them.)<br>
<br>
Barch: To all my minions, the Lawndalians, and--UGH--<br>
you......you......MALES!! Prepare to be stupid----uh,<br>
I meant stupified, with my latest innovation. For years,<br>
we women were maltreated by the ultimate scum of the Earth,<br>
known as the male gender, taking advantage of women,<br>
treating them like servants......But tonight, all that<br>
will change......what you're 'bout to see, is a breakthrough<br>
in biogenetic research........to clone from DNA scratch, a<br>
REAL wimp of a male for me, to serve me and take out his own<br>
trash cans!!<br>
<br>
(Applause)<br>
<br>
Barch (continued): You, the doubters, get a ringside seat,<br>
for a major first in MTV history, since Xmas, Halloween and<br>
Guy Fawkes Day came from Holiday High. Not since that Britney<br>
Spears broke up with that loser Justin, have we come up with<br>
.......an invention to solve every woman's problem!! (<br>
To Jane and Trent) Prepare the protoplasmic armature!!<br>
<br>
(Trent and Jane haul a huge log shaped hunk of white wax,<br>
set it upright in the cabinet, slam its door, and head to<br>
the control panel.)<br>
<br>
Jane: All set. All cloning matrix readings say danger is go.<br>
<br>
Barch: Activate all systems. Start the extended range fixed<br>
filter bank.<br>
<br>
Brittany: Extended range fixed filter bank activated.<br>
<br>
Barch: Start voltage controlled lowpass filter.<br>
<br>
Trent: Voltage controlled lowpass filter activated.<br>
<br>
Barch: Start voltage controlled highpass filter.<br>
<br>
Jane: Voltage controlled highpass filter activated.<br>
<br>
Barch: Channeling all DNA fluids to the cloning matrix....<br>
setting power to 1200,000 volts...........tang.......go!!<br>
<br>
(Barch throws a pair of knife switches, and countless<br>
lightning bolts shoot out from the overhead electrodes to<br>
the ones on the cabinet, which shakes, rattles and rolls<br>
for 4 minutes, then on one of the screens, a display reading<br>
FINISHED flashes; Barch turns the power off, approaches the<br>
cabinet and opens it. Out steps, in a gold tank top and gold<br>
swimming trunks, is Timothy O'Neill.)<br>
<br>
O'Neill: Hellllllllo,everyone!! Wanna form a feeling circle<br>
with me?<br>
<br>
Barch (overjoyed): Oh, SKINNY!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
Daria: It's alive........!!<br>
<br>
(O'Neill starts running 'round the room, up the stairs,<br>
running past the amused Lawndalians, with Barch chasing him<br>
lustfully)<br>
<br>
THE SWORD OF JANET BARCH<br>
Parody of The Sword Damoclese<br>
Perfomed by Timothy O'Neill &amp;<br>
The Lawndalians<br>
<br>
O'Neill:<br>
The sword of Janet Barch is hangin' over my head<br>
an' I've got the feelin' someone wants me real dead.<br>
Oh, woe is me, why was I born a wimp?<br>
Oh, can't you see, that I ain't got no backbone, poor me?<br>
I woke up from the steely box, and I am a crybaby.<br>
<br>
The Lawndalians:<br>
That ain't no crime.<br>
<br>
O'Neill:<br>
An' what's worse, I was born with a bad asmtha problem.<br>
<br>
The Lawndalians:<br>
That ain't no crime.<br>
<br>
O'Neill:<br>
My love life's low<br>
I teach self esteem on the go<br>
Yet all I know is, I can't seem to teach my students.<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
Oh, Timmy!!<br>
<br>
The Lawndalians:<br>
Sha, la, la, la, that ain't no crime.<br>
<br>
O'Neill:<br>
Oh no, no, no.<br>
<br>
The Lawndalians:<br>
Sha, la, la, la, that ain't no crime.<br>
<br>
O'Neill:<br>
Oh no, no, no.<br>
<br>
The Lawndalians:<br>
Sha, la, la, la, that ain't no crime.<br>
<br>
O'Neill:<br>
Oh no, no, no.<br>
The sword of Janet Barch is hangin' over my head.<br>
<br>
The Lawndalians:<br>
That ain't no crime.<br>
<br>
O'Neill:<br>
An' I've got the feelin' someone wants me real dead.<br>
<br>
The Lawndalians:<br>
Sha, la, la, la, that ain't no crime.<br>
<br>
O'Neill:<br>
Oh, woe is me, my life is a mystery<br>
An', can't you see, that I am the wimpiest teacher<br>
in Lawndale?<br>
<br>
The Lawndalians:<br>
Sha, la, la, la, that ain't no crime.<br>
<br>
O'Neill:<br>
Oh, no, no, no.<br>
<br>
The Lawndalians:<br>
Sha, la, la, la, that ain't no crime.<br>
<br>
O'Neill:<br>
Oh, no, no, no.<br>
<br>
The Lawndalians:<br>
Sha, la, la, la, that ain't no crime,<br>
Sha, la, la, la, that ain't no crime,<br>
Sha, la, la, la, that ain't no crime,<br>
sha, la, la, la..........<br>
<br>
(O'Neill comes to a stop at the control panel before Trent,<br>
Jane and Brittany before Barch reaches him.)<br>
<br>
Barch: You.......you MAN!! Well really......!! That<br>
ain't no way to behave on your first day!!<br>
<br>
O'Neill: Sorry. Guess I got carried away.<br>
<br>
Barch: Sorry? SORRY?!? But since you're an exceptional<br>
beauty, I've got to forgive you. Oh, I just love<br>
success.<br>
<br>
Trent: He's a credit to Alt. Lawndale. com.<br>
<br>
Barch: Yes.<br>
<br>
Jane: A triumph of Sick Sad World.<br>
<br>
Barch: Yes.<br>
<br>
Brittany: He's OK.<br>
<br>
(Everyone stares at Brittany as if she had just<br>
said something blasphemous.)<br>
<br>
Brittany: What?<br>
<br>
Barch: OK? OK?!? I think we can do better that that.<br>
<br>
O'Neill: Then let's all say, "Brava, brava!!"<br>
<br>
The Lawndalians: BRAVA!! BRAVA!!<br>
<br>
Barch: So funny, I forgot to laugh.......(leads<br>
O'Neill to Daria and Tom) So what do you think of him?<br>
<br>
Tom: Someone call Ripley--as in Believe It Or Not.<br>
<br>
Daria: Just what we need-------a wimpy version cross<br>
twixt Upchuck and Mariah Carey, fortified with a touch<br>
of Cameron Diaz for extra wimpiness.<br>
<br>
Upchuck's voice: Rrrrrrrrrrrrr, fiesty.<br>
<br>
Barch: I DIDN'T make him for you, DUH!! He (gesturing<br>
at O'Neill) carries the Gloria Steinham seal of<br>
approval!! (Leads O'Neill to a pile of books, each<br>
with a tag reading HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SKINNY, while<br>
singing the next tune)<br>
<br>
I CAN MAKE YOU MY MAN<br>
Parody of I Can Make You A Man<br>
Performed by Janet Barch &amp; The<br>
Lawndalians<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
A tough man, weighin' 200 pounds,<br>
will get beat by his wife, when kicked<br>
to the ground.<br>
An' with cash as the source,<br>
for the wife's divorce.......<br>
The sweat from his pores, as the man<br>
loses all.....<br>
will make him cower an' fret,<br>
an' with cringin', an' just a small bit<br>
of re....gret....<br>
He'll be toast, an' all set!!<br>
He'll be a.......weak man!!<br>
Oh darling----<br>
<br>
Barch &amp; The Lawndalians:<br>
But a sneak man!!<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
He'll bring me breakfast, in my bed,<br>
an' take out the trash,<br>
Try to pay alimony,<br>
with bona fide cash<br>
Such an effort,<br>
if he only knew of my plan;<br>
in just seven days--<br>
<br>
Barch &amp; The Lawndalians:<br>
I can make you, my man.........!!<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
He'll then booze it, an' lose it,<br>
at poker, that jerk!!<br>
He thinks romancin' women,<br>
must be hard work.<br>
Such riotous living----<br>
I just don't understand----<br>
When in just seven days,<br>
oh Skinny----<br>
I can make you, my man..............!!<br>
<br>
(On the giant panel, a light labeled DEEP FREEZE<br>
flashes, and the freezer door opens; cold fog swirls<br>
out, while the sound of a motorcycle can be heard.)<br>
<br>
Brittany: KEVVY!!<br>
<br>
(From behind a wall of ice blocks in the freezer,<br>
we hear Kevin Thomson.)<br>
<br>
Kevin's voice: Uh, like, welcome to Nuts World,<br>
uh, no, uh, POW!! BLAM!! KABLOOEY!! Ratboy rocks!!<br>
NO!! That ain't it!! Now I remember.....!!<br>
<br>
(The sound of a motorcyle starts up, and Kevin,<br>
on a chopper, if not a hog, crashes through the ice<br>
block wall, and Brittany climbs on, riding all over the<br>
lab, just doing what Meat Loaf did in RHPS--you get<br>
the idea.)<br>
<br>
OH, SWEET BRITTANY, MAKE THE CALL<br>
(That was the best I could do)<br>
Parody of Hot Patootie, Bless My Soul<br>
Perfomed by Kevin Thomson<br>
<br>
Kevin:<br>
Whatever happened to school football night?<br>
I miss those days an' those ol' football plays<br>
I had The Pigskin Channel an' Rat Boy.<br>
Along came Brittany who made me her boy toy.<br>
We used to bicker an' sometimes make out<br>
until Janet Barch stepped in an' would shout:<br>
"Beat it,Kevin!! You crummy male cur!!<br>
Get outa here!!" SHEESH!! What a lousy grouch!!<br>
Oh, sweet Brittany, make the call!! I truly love that ol' football!!<br>
Oh, sweet Brittany, make the call!! I truly love that ol' football!!<br>
Oh, sweet Brittany, make the call!! I truly love that ol' football!!<br>
Oh, sweet Brittany, make the call!! I truly love that ol' football!!<br>
<br>
(Despite herself, Barch picks up a saxophone<br>
and plays a sax solo)<br>
<br>
Kevin:<br>
Tommy Sherman used to be a football star<br>
To me, he was legend, so he was my hero,<br>
but to the others, he was such a zero.<br>
Yet they named a goalpost in his honor<br>
He tried hit on Britt, THAT was so sick!!<br>
No wonder he couldn't fit in anyone's clique<br>
Worse still, he even put down The Misery Chick.<br>
The goalpost fell!! NO!! Poor Tommy was dead!!<br>
Oh, sweet Brittany, make the call!! I truly love that ol' football!!<br>
(repeat x12)<br>
<br>
(While the tune nears the end, Brittany does her<br>
cheerleader moves; taking the advantage, Barch<br>
unsheaths two 7 foot samurai swords, and with inhuman<br>
precision, hurls them like javelins----and they<br>
impale through Kevin's heart. Soon after that, Kevin<br>
falls down, dead. After the tune finishes, Brittany<br>
sees what happened to Kevin, shrieks, runs to his dead<br>
form, and cries.)<br>
<br>
Barch: One for the Lawndale Morgue.<br>
<br>
Brittany: WHAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My poor Kevvy!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
Barch: Don't be upset......it was just a mercy kill.<br>
Besides, he's with the winners now.<br>
<br>
Brittany: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!! (to Barch)<br>
You're so mean!!!! (Kicks Barch in the stomach before<br>
she hightails it from the lab.)<br>
<br>
Barch: OOOOOOOFFFFFF!!!!!! Stupid ungrateful brat!!<br>
<br>
O'Neill: Now THAT must hurt.<br>
<br>
(Barch recovers and turns to O'Neill.)<br>
<br>
Barch: Oh,Timmy!! Please understand.........he had a<br>
naive followin', but.........no wimpiness.<br>
<br>
Daria: That is sure to set Mary Shelley back 1200 years.<br>
<br>
Tom: Not to mention Hollywood.<br>
<br>
(Trent and Jane approach Barch and help her out from her<br>
smock, and we can see she's still in her black satin<br>
bustier, panty and thigh highs, while she sings the<br>
next tune.)<br>
<br>
I CAN MAKE YOU MY MAN (REPRISE)<br>
Parody of I Can Make You A Man (Reprise)<br>
Perfomed by Janet Barch, Daria Morgendorffer,<br>
&amp; The Lawndalians<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
But a..........lawyer an' a, black eye<br>
A lawsuit, an' a good cry<br>
It makes me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, shake!!<br>
It makes me wanna take Jill Sobule, by the<br>
........HAND!!<br>
<br>
Barch &amp; The Lawndalians:<br>
In just seven days.......I can<br>
make you, my man!!<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
I don't want no, dissension--<br>
just, male hatin', tension.<br>
<br>
Daria:<br>
I am a wimpy man.<br>
<br>
Barch &amp; The Lawndalians:<br>
In just seven days, I can make you,<br>
my man!!<br>
Dig it--------if you ca--an!!<br>
In just seven days, I can make you,<br>
my MAN!!<br>
<br>
(The recessional version of the wedding march plays,<br>
and arm in arm, Barch and O'Neill march to the curtained<br>
passage which is now open, revealing a four poster bed;<br>
behind it, a stained glass window of Billie Jean King. The<br>
Lawndalians flank Barch and O'Neill, while tossing rice.)<br>
<br>
The Lawndalians (chanting): Diarrhea, cha, cha, cha!!<br>
Diarrhea, cha, cha, cha!! Diarrhea, cha, cha, cha!!<br>
Diarrhea, cha, cha, cha!!<br>
<br>
Daria: Good grief, not them too!!<br>
<br>
Tom: Must've seen the same show.<br>
<br>
(Just before the curtain closes, we see Barch punch<br>
O'Neill in the stomach.)<br>
<br>
(It's back to Defoe's art room, where she is studying<br>
the cover art of The Electric Light Orchestra's Out Of<br>
The Blue album, before she turns to the camera.)<br>
<br>
Defoe: They're those that believe that say life is an<br>
illusion, and that reality is but a pigment----uh, I mean<br>
figment of the imagination. Such imagination was what<br>
resulted in the fantastic work Shushei Nagaoka did for<br>
The Electric Light Orchestra, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire and<br>
The Jefferson Starship. If that is so, then Tom and<br>
Daria were quite safe. However the sudden departure<br>
of Ms. Barch....and her creation.......in the seclusion<br>
of her suite had left them looking foward to seeing Sick<br>
Sad World on the TV before hitting the hay, yet fearing; a<br>
feeling which grew when the Lawndalians departed, and they<br>
were shown to their seperate rooms.<br>
<br>
CHAPTER 4: Betrayal's just a game<br>
<br>
(Brittany shows Daria and Tom each to a room;<br>
Daria's is lit up with red light, while Tom's is<br>
lit up with green. Meanwhile, in the lab, Trent and<br>
Jane stare at one of the control panel's TV screens,<br>
which via camera survallience system, spy on Daria's<br>
room, where we see only a silhouette of our bespecticled<br>
heroine.Then a door opens and closes, and we see another<br>
silhouette, who approaches Daria, and tickles her feet.)<br>
<br>
Daria: Tom!! Tom, stop that!! I am ticklish!! Stop it!!<br>
Ok, I warned you!!<br>
<br>
(Daria heads to the figure----and recoils in shock at<br>
who the tickler is)<br>
<br>
Daria (gasps): Ms. Barch!! YOU?!?<br>
<br>
Barch: Yep--------but ain't love just grand? (Tries to<br>
kiss Daria, who gets up.)<br>
<br>
Daria: OK, what chuu do with Tom? 'Sides, you ain't the<br>
only one that learned the Take Back The Night self<br>
defense program.<br>
<br>
Barch: Not a thing-----only I don't see why'd you'd<br>
hang with.....that.......MAN!!<br>
<br>
Daria: Why not? It'd be better than makin' out with a<br>
Nicole Kidman clone on steroids like you.<br>
<br>
Barch: Grr...you're a traitor to your own<br>
gender..........<br>
<br>
Daria: Even if I beat you at cards?<br>
<br>
Barch: 7 card stud.<br>
<br>
(Back in the lab, Trent and Jane sneak up in Barch's<br>
suite, where O'Neill is sleeping. The Lane siblings<br>
exchange grins before the two jump up, and make<br>
noises off, which scares O'Neill.)<br>
<br>
Jane &amp; Trent: BOOGIE,BOOGIE,BOOGIE,<br>
BOOGIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
O'Neill: AAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGHHHH!!!!!!!!! BLAME IT<br>
ON THE BOOGIE!!!!!!! HELLLLLLLLLP!!!!!!<br>
<br>
(O'Neill hightails it to the elevator; soon after<br>
that, he is in the pouring rain, running while we hear<br>
Napolean XIV doing They're Coming To Take Me Away.<br>
Meanwhile,in Tom's room, Barch arrives on the scene,<br>
and uses a belt to whip Tom.)<br>
<br>
Tom: OUCH!! Daria, stop!! That hurts!! I thought<br>
you loved me!!<br>
<br>
Barch: I ain't Daria........you...................<br>
you MAN!! (Laughs dementedly)<br>
<br>
Tom: Oh, me!! Barch!! What chuu do with Daria.......as<br>
if I didn't know.<br>
<br>
Barch: Not a thing, male lowlife scum!! I waited a long<br>
time to put you through the wringer in the worst way.<br>
<br>
Tom: Listen, just beacause your spouse left you years ago,<br>
don't mean you got to take it out on every male you meet.<br>
<br>
Barch: Like hell!! I don't give a hang 'bout that!! All<br>
males,they're like weapons on two feet!! And I could<br>
take em' all in any way, any place,any time,<br>
anywhere.I can even beat them at cards!!<br>
<br>
Tom: How 'bout 7 card stud?<br>
<br>
Barch: You're goin' down, male pig. (laughs triumphntly<br>
while dealing out the cards.)<br>
<br>
(Just then, on a nearby TV screen, the image of Trent<br>
Lane comes onscreen.)<br>
<br>
Trent: Hey, J.B. , we got a problem.<br>
<br>
Barch: SHADDAP, TRENT!!<br>
<br>
Trent: No, YOU shaddap!! O'Neill flew the coop, but<br>
Janey's got the dogs on his trail.<br>
<br>
Barch: WHAT?!? My Skinny!! Hop to it then, male slime!!<br>
I'll be there soon as I can!!<br>
<br>
(Outside in the rain, while The Baha Men's Who Let The<br>
Dogs Out plays, O'Neill is running for his life, with<br>
a pack of dogs on his tail. Meanwhile, in the main<br>
foyer, Daria is wandering the halls before heading to<br>
the elevator.)<br>
<br>
Daria: Boy----not a decent thing to eat here......I<br>
wonder if Sick Sad World is on tonight? (Enters the<br>
elevator, and goes up to the lab level, where she heads<br>
to the main control panel.)<br>
<br>
Daria (continued): If only the tires didn't go flat<br>
.........if only it didn't rain........if only there<br>
never were a Beavis and Butt Head.........if only our<br>
show never got canceled......what'd they do to Tom?<br>
<br>
(Spotting one of the screens, Daria pushes a series of<br>
buttons, and the image of Tom and Barch playing 7 card<br>
stud comes onscreen.)<br>
<br>
Daria (sobbing): Tom.......!! First Trent, and now<br>
you.......!! I hope the Sick Sad World staffers<br>
take notes.......<br>
<br>
(From the Cres-Cor cabinet, we hear O'Neill's<br>
voice.)<br>
<br>
O'Neill's voice: Is that you, Daria? Got any Band<br>
Aids?<br>
<br>
(Heading to the cabinet, Daria opens its door,<br>
and sees a sobbing O'Neil,one leg bleeding from<br>
some cuts.)<br>
<br>
Daria: I told you, if you play with Ms. Barch,<br>
you get hurt.<br>
<br>
O'Neill: That wasn't Janet------I cut myself on<br>
the rose bushes tryin' to escape those stupid<br>
steel jawed mutts.What kind of man am I? I only<br>
wanted to be loved, and an' now.......(cries)<br>
<br>
Daria: Maybe I can help. (Reaches in her vest<br>
pocket and comes up with a handful of Band Aids,<br>
before applying them to the cuts.)<br>
<br>
O'Neill: Thanks. I just wish those Lawndalians<br>
hadn't done that "Diarrhea, cha, cha, cha." chant<br>
----it's so.......icky......<br>
<br>
Daria: Amen. The only two people that chanted<br>
that to me, not to mention called me Diarrhea<br>
were the biggest losers that thought of sex and<br>
girls, during my years in Highland High--and<br>
Beavis and Butt Head were their names.<br>
<br>
O'Neill: Butt Head?<br>
<br>
Daria: His mom was high on morhpine at the time<br>
<br>
O'Neill: Can you explain that?<br>
<br>
(Back in the art room, Claire Defoe exmaines Brittany's<br>
art fair winning painting from Arts &amp; Crass, before<br>
turning back to the camera.)<br>
<br>
Defoe: Emotion.........love........cynicism<br>
.........agitation......disturbance of the mind;<br>
it's a strong form of mind control.........and<br>
from what Jane and Brittany saw on their TV<br>
survellance screen, there was no doubt--sorry,<br>
Gwen--that Daria was still the same cynic she was<br>
before.<br>
<br>
(Inside Brittany's room, decorated with posters of<br>
Kevin, along withother cheerleaders, we see Brittany,<br>
in a pengoir, and Jane, in a chemise, lounging on<br>
the bed, seeing Daria talk with O'Neill on their TV<br>
screen.)<br>
<br>
Brittany &amp; Jane: Tell us 'bout it, Daria. (They laugh)<br>
<br>
(Back at the lab, Daria does her tune while O'Neill<br>
sips a cup of java.)<br>
<br>
DON'T TOUCH-A, TOUCH-A, TOUCH ME<br>
Parody of Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me<br>
Performed by Daria Morgendorffer,<br>
Brittany Taylor &amp; Jane Lane<br>
<br>
Daria:<br>
I was feelin' bland, in Highland<br>
I thought it couldn't get worse then.<br>
<br>
Brittany:<br>
You mean they........?<br>
<br>
Jane:<br>
Uh huh....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Daria:<br>
Until Beavis and Butt Head<br>
came to Highland High, well, 'nuff said<br>
An' then that led to trouble<br>
an'.........much dread.<br>
All they think of is sex----an' what's worse, girls<br>
Those peons don't know how to score.<br>
<br>
Brittany &amp; Jane:<br>
Score, score, score.<br>
<br>
Daria:<br>
To them, I say, "No way!!<br>
You guys, just go away!!"<br>
I can't stand them at all<br>
so to them, I say:<br>
"Don't touch-a, touch-a, touch me,<br>
I don't wanna be dirty.<br>
Don't hug me, kiss me, nor date me.<br>
you're both just losers."<br>
Go back to Highland High, on the sly<br>
lest I kick you outa my town.<br>
<br>
Brittany &amp; Jane:<br>
Town, town, town.<br>
<br>
Daria:<br>
Your "Huh, huh, huh, huh." ain't no<br>
fraction to get my attraction.<br>
I wanna get a life, an' you want action.<br>
Don't touch-a, touch-a, touch me,<br>
I don't wanna be dirty.<br>
Don't hug me, kiss me, nor date me.<br>
you're both just losers.<br>
<br>
(Back to Brittany and Jane who sing along to the<br>
stupid tune, making a mockery of it)<br>
<br>
Brittany:<br>
Don't touch-a, touch-a, touch me. (kisses Jane)<br>
<br>
Jane:<br>
I don't wanna be dirty. (blows a raspberry)<br>
<br>
Brittany:<br>
Don't hug me, kiss me, nor date me.<br>
(kisses Jane on both face cheeks)<br>
<br>
Jane:<br>
You're both just losers. (plays with Brittany's pig tails)<br>
<br>
(Back to the lab with Daria, who sings her soul<br>
out, while O'Neill plays cat's cradle.)<br>
<br>
Daria:<br>
Don't touch-a, touch-a, touch me,<br>
I don't wanna be dirty.<br>
Don't hug me, kiss me, nor date me.<br>
you're both just losers.<br>
<br>
(Here's where the toilet bowl shot takes place,<br>
in which everyone gets to do their own line.)<br>
<br>
Brittany:<br>
Beavis and Butt-Head are not real.<br>
<br>
Jane:<br>
They are stupid cartoon people completely<br>
made up by this Texas guy whom we hardly<br>
even know.<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
Beavis and Butt-Head are dumb, crude,<br>
thoughtless, ugly, sexist, self-destructive<br>
fools.<br>
<br>
Trent:<br>
But for some reason, the little<br>
stupidheads make us laugh.<br>
<br>
Tom:<br>
No wonder Daria left Highland.<br>
<br>
O'Neill:<br>
Butt Head?<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
Go figure, Skinny.<br>
<br>
Daria:<br>
You're both just losers.<br>
<br>
(One hour later in the lab. We don't see Daria, nor<br>
O'Neill anywhere, but the elevator door opens, and<br>
Trent runs out, with an irate Barch, who is whipping<br>
the slacker with a guitar string. Tom comes on behind<br>
Barch, out into the lab, and Trent is cowering on the<br>
floor, while Barch savagely whips his hide with the<br>
string.)<br>
<br>
Trent: OW!! OWWWWW!! OW!! YEE-OUCH!! MERCY!! That<br>
string's from my Fender Stratocaster!!<br>
<br>
Barch: How did it happen?!? I THOUGHT you understood<br>
that you were to keep an eye on him, you.......you MAN!!!!<br>
<br>
Trent: So I was on my coffee break.<br>
<br>
Barch: Then see if you can locate him on the survellance<br>
system.<br>
<br>
(Trent, with Barch and Tom in tow, hightails to<br>
the giant control panel, and after pushing several<br>
buttons, one of the screens comes on. It shows the<br>
main foyer, where someone is standing near the<br>
stairs----and it's Quinn,in her pink blouse with<br>
the gold butterfly and her trademark jeans.)<br>
<br>
Trent: Barch, we've got a visitor.<br>
<br>
Tom: Hey, it's Quinn. (Barch and Trent stare at him.)<br>
Quinn Morgendorffer.<br>
<br>
Trent: You know that Terran-----uh, I mean person?<br>
<br>
Tom: I should say so!! She's Daria's sister.<br>
<br>
(Upon hearing that, Brach glowers at Tom.)<br>
<br>
Barch: I see..........so it wasn't simply a chance<br>
meeting.You came here on purpose.......you MAN!!<br>
<br>
Tom: I told you me an' Daria wound up with four flat<br>
tires. I told you the truth!!<br>
<br>
Barch: FOOL!! You think I'd believe in a male parasite<br>
like YOU?!? 'Sides, I know what you told me, but that<br>
Quinn Morgendorffer.......her name ain't unknown to me.<br>
<br>
Tom: She and Daria went to Lawndale High.......sure<br>
you'd know her.<br>
<br>
Barch:And she also dated the 3 J's, a.k.a., the<br>
male slimebugs of planetEarth, didn't she, Tom?<br>
(shoves Tom roughly) She's yet another traitor to<br>
her own gender, just like her sister Daria!! Ain't<br>
that right, Tom?!? (Shoves Tom who falls on his butt.)<br>
<br>
Tom (after getting his second wind): Could be.<br>
<br>
Trent: The intruder is heading up the stairs, Barch.<br>
<br>
Barch: She'll probably be....in the Susan B. Anthony room.<br>
<br>
(We see Quinn in a room featuring paintings of the<br>
female crusader of women's rights to vote, while<br>
The Squirrel Nut Zippers' Anything But Love plays.<br>
Back at the lab, Barch reaches for a switch marked<br>
UNIVERSAL TRACTOR BEAM.)<br>
<br>
Barch: Shalt we inquire of her in person?<br>
<br>
(Barch pulls the switch, and a steel plate pops<br>
out from the wall on the right hand side of the<br>
freezer door. A deep bass like humming sound comes from<br>
it, its magnetic field reaching out till it attracts<br>
itself onto Quinn's belt buckle, and pulls her down the<br>
halls of the building.)<br>
<br>
Quinn: YIPE!!<br>
<br>
(While The Electric Light Orchestra's Don't Bring Me<br>
Down plays, the force of the tractor beam pulls Quinn<br>
through the hall, past Jane and Brittany, down several<br>
more halls, before she crashes through the wall of the<br>
lab.)<br>
<br>
Quinn: EW!! PLASTER!!<br>
<br>
Tom: Great Scott!! UH!! I mean, Quinn!!<br>
<br>
(While toilet paper flies everywhere, the tractor beam<br>
pulls Quinn down the stairs, before she winds up<br>
stuck on the plate with a clang.)<br>
<br>
Quinn: Ms. Janet Barch, we finally meet.Thanks to you,<br>
your tacky move got me drenched in plaster!!<br>
<br>
Tom (shaking Quinn's hand): Quinn!!<br>
<br>
Quinn: Tom!! What chuu doin' here?<br>
<br>
Barch (to Quinn): Don't play head games with me, you<br>
fellow traitor to your gender, a.k.a. ,Quinn M.!!<br>
You know why your sister and her parasite of a boyfriend<br>
would be here!! That they would check my citidel for<br>
you an' your.........fellow hooligans!! Well,<br>
unforutnately for you all, the plans will be changed.<br>
I am quite adaptable.<br>
<br>
Quinn: Well, the thought did cross my mind, but no.<br>
I've come to search for Kevin.<br>
<br>
Tom: Kevin!! Barch put him through the wringer.<br>
<br>
Barch: Kevin!! I had to!! What do you know of Kevin?<br>
<br>
Quinn: He an' I did a science project with Daria.<br>
<br>
(Barch pauses for a moment before turning off the<br>
tractor beam; Quinn falls off the plate, on her butt.<br>
And that is when we hear the voices of Daria and O'Neill<br>
coming from the Cres-Cor Crown-X cabinet.)<br>
<br>
Daria's voice: Four of a kind!!<br>
<br>
O'Neill's voice: Oh,foo!!<br>
<br>
(Barch walks up to the cabinet and opens its door;<br>
inside, using a flashlight, is Daria and O'Neill<br>
playing 7 card stud.)<br>
<br>
O'Neill: Oops!!<br>
<br>
Daria: Yipe!!<br>
<br>
Quinn: Daria!!<br>
<br>
Daria: Quinn!!<br>
<br>
Tom: Daria!!<br>
<br>
Daria: Tom!!<br>
<br>
Barch: Skinny!!<br>
<br>
Quinn: Daria!!<br>
<br>
Daria: Quinn!!<br>
<br>
Tom: Daria!!<br>
<br>
Daria: Tom!!<br>
<br>
Barch: Skinny!!<br>
<br>
Quinn: Daria!!<br>
<br>
Daria: Quinn!!<br>
<br>
Tom: Daria!!<br>
<br>
Daria: Tom!!<br>
<br>
Barch: Skinny!!<br>
<br>
Quinn: Daria!!<br>
<br>
Daria: Quinn!!<br>
<br>
Tom: Daria!!<br>
<br>
Daria: Tom!!<br>
<br>
Barch: Skinny!!<br>
<br>
(Furious, Barch pulls O'Neill out from the cabinet<br>
by his tank top, and glowers in his face.)<br>
<br>
Barch: You......you MAN!! You're just like my sugar<br>
pig spouse, when he left me!! Listen---------I made<br>
you, an' I can break you easily!!<br>
<br>
O'Neill: You can't blame me for trying.<br>
<br>
(Just then, Jane, back in her maid uniform, bangs a gong.)<br>
<br>
Jane: Barch, dinner is prepared. It's pepperoni pizza<br>
with soda pop.<br>
<br>
Quinn: Got any low fat no cheese pizza with diet soda?<br>
<br>
Jane: Sure thing, girly girl.<br>
<br>
Quinn: WHOO-HOO!! Thanks!!<br>
<br>
Barch: Well done. Under the circumstances....... (to<br>
Daria,in her sleep wear.) dress is to be optional.<br>
<br>
(Back to Defoe's art room, where Defoe is inspecting some<br>
paintings of bowls of fruit in still life projects,<br>
including Jane's painting of bloodied soldiers from<br>
Daria Dance Party. Then she returns her attention<br>
to the camera.)<br>
<br>
Defoe: Food always played a major role in life's rituals:<br>
the breaking of bread, the last meal of the condemmed<br>
person, and now, that meal of Barch's. However<br>
informal it may seem, you can be sure that there<br>
was to be scarcely any meaning----or was there?<br>
<br>
(Barch and co. settle down to a table while Trent and Jane<br>
serve the pizza, soda, and birthday party hats.)<br>
<br>
O'Neill: Come on, let's eat!! Stuff's s'posed to make me hungry!!<br>
<br>
Barch: First things first. Everyone get your party hats on. (Everyone does<br>
so, while Barch lifts her soda can to a toast.) A toast.......<br>
to hooligan friends.<br>
<br>
All: To hooligan friends.<br>
<br>
Barch: And Timmy here. (Points to O'Neill.) Everyone got<br>
your party hats on?<br>
<br>
All: YUP!!<br>
<br>
Barch: Then let's get started. (Blows a horn and clasps her<br>
palms in prayer.)<br>
<br>
Daria: Beats lasanga anytime.<br>
<br>
Tom: My family eats filet migon.<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
<br>
Happy birthday to you,<br>
<br>
happy birthday to you,<br>
<br>
happy birthday to Skinny,<br>
<br>
happy birthday to you,<br>
<br>
an' many more, until the war.<br>
<br>
Daria: To my sweathog, hapee burd doo.<br>
<br>
Barch: Says you. Shalt we?<br>
<br>
Quinn: Hey, what 'bout Kevin?<br>
<br>
Brittany: Kevvy?<br>
<br>
Barch:A rather tender subject.<br>
<br>
Brittany: Pardon me. (To O'Neill) You can have my slice.<br>
<br>
O'Neill: Thanks!!<br>
<br>
(Brittany gets up and exits, closing the doors; a few<br>
seconds,we hear her switching to crybaby mode.)<br>
<br>
Brittany's voice (sobbing): OH----------------------------NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!<br>
(Cries big time.)<br>
<br>
Jane: What a crybaby. Let's put her outa her misery.<br>
<br>
Trent: Hey, Janey, don't give the plot away.<br>
<br>
Jane: Sorry.<br>
<br>
Quinn: I knew he was in a bad crowd, but he WAS the QB.<br>
<br>
Dumb aliens!!<br>
<br>
O'Neill: Huh?<br>
<br>
Daria &amp; Tom: Quinn?<br>
<br>
Barch: Go on Quinn.<br>
<br>
CHAPTER 5: Worse comes to worst<br>

KEVIN<br>
Parody of Eddie<br>

Claire Defoe, Janet Barch &amp; Brittany Taylor<br>
<br>
Quinn:<br>
From the day he was born,<br>
he was born STUU----PID.<br>
He was the beau of Britt<br>
Taylor.<br>
We gave it our all......<br>
<br>
(Change to Defoe's room.)<br>
<br>
Defoe:<br>
........but all he could do was just play football.<br>
<br>
(Back to Quinn.)<br>
<br>
Quinn:<br>
He took his Rat Boy comics that day.<br>
High school football he'd play<br>
All he wanted, was his Brittany,<br>
an' to be the QB.<br>
What a nut.......<br>
<br>
Defoe:<br>
He was the QB, yet he tried to be all he could be.<br>
<br>
Quinn:<br>
Poor Kevin an' Brittany.......!!<br>
<br>
All:<br>
When Kevin said he wanted to be Lawndale's hero,<br>
we knew we had a great big zero<br>
But when he played, he proved them wrong, oh, for so long.<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
What a wimp!!<br>
<br>
Daria:<br>
He ain't no gimp<br>
<br>
Quinn:<br>
An' I told you so.<br>
<br>
(In her room, Brittany mourns for Kevin.)<br>
<br>
Brittany:<br>
Everyone envied me, my Kevvy truly loved me.<br>
Even when we fight, it don't matter to me.<br>
I told Kevvy to stay an' kiss up with me,<br>
but he was smitten by Angie without warnin' me!!<br>
<br>
Quinn:<br>
Yet some dumb thing must've scared him<br>
for he just warned me in a note that reads.....<br>
<br>
All:<br>
What's it say?<br>
What's it say?<br>
<br>
Kevin's voice:<br>
"Help!! Ms. Barch just shanghaied me!!<br>
Oh, hurry, for time's up for the QB<br>
They musn't begin their unholy crummy deed!!"<br>
<br>
(Sound of Kevin's scream)<br>
<br>
All:<br>
When Kevin said he wanted to be Lawndale's hero,<br>
we knew we had a great big zero<br>
But when he played, he proved them wrong, oh, for so long.<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
What a wimp!!<br>

Daria:<br>
He ain't no gimp<br>

Daria:<br>
He ain't no gimp<br>
<br>
Quinn:<br>
An' I told you so.<br>
<br>
(An irate Barch stands up, and glares at Quinn.)<br>
<br>
Barch: I thought so.........a definite traitor to<br>
your own gender. You think you're so popular......well,<br>
here's what I think!!<br>
<br>
(Barch pulls off the tablecloth, revealing the dead Kevin,<br>
disembowelled from the samurai sword attack, under glass.<br>
Naturally Quinn lets out a 15 decibel scream, O'Neill<br>
freaks out, and Daria's eyes bug out.)<br>
<br>
Daria: Hating males is one thing, but........alert<br>
Sick Sad World......!!<br>
<br>
Quinn: EW!! A dead bloody body!!<br>
<br>
O'Neill: A dead body?!? LEMME OUTA HERE!!<br>
<br>
(Runs to Daria and hangs on to her----THAT truly<br>
enrages Barch.)<br>
<br>
Barch: Oh, Skinny!! How could you?!?<br>
<br>
O'Neill: Easy----I got scared.<br>
<br>
Daria: Listen, it wasn't my fault.I can't help it<br>
if I was born to be The Misery Chick.<br>
<br>
Barch: Then, let's put YOU out of YOUR misery!!<br>
<br>
(Unsheaths the same swords used to stab Kevin,<br>
and chases Daria down the hall to the lab, with Tom,<br>
Quinn, and the rest coming on behind.)<br>
<br>
STARIA TARIA DARIA<br>
Parody of Planet Shmanet Janet<br>
Performed by Janet Barch, Daria<br>
&amp; Quinn Morgendorffer, Tom Sloane<br>
&amp; Claire Defoe<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
I just told you----an' I just told them<br>
You'd best wise up--------Daria M.<br>
You think your show, was the creme<br>
de la creme.<br>
You'd best wise up---------Daria M.<br>
You ain't first rate, so I say you just get it straight<br>
So it's no wonder, you made a blunder, an' dated<br>
Trent Lane.<br>
An' then Tom Sloane, he chose you 'stead of Jane.<br>
<br>
(Finally everyone is in Barch's lab, with the said<br>
Barch at the control panel.)<br>
<br>
Barch (continued):<br>
I've got one trick, you misery chick.<br>
You'd best wise up------------Daria M.<br>
My paralyzer, will hypnotize ya.<br>
<br>
(Barch reaches for, and pushes a button marked NEURO<br>
PARALYZER; Daria, Tom and Quinn instantly become<br>
immobilized, their feet rooted to the lab floor.)<br>
<br>
Daria: Yipe!! I can't move my feet!!<br>
<br>
Tom: Me neither!!<br>
<br>
Quinn: Me neither, neither!!<br>
<br>
Barch: No kiddin'!! It's somethin' you can get used to.<br>
<br>
Quinn: Not when you consider the fact 'bout your<br>
digital transmat beam system.<br>
<br>
Daria: Say what?<br>
<br>
Quinn: Somethin' some of the cute guys in the computer<br>
lab in Lawndale High was workin' on, absolutely top secret<br>
--only now, Barch an' her bunch know how to build it.<br>
It's a digital matter transmitter which digitizes<br>
any matter, an' broadcasts it through space an' time.<br>
<br>
Tom: Wow.......!! It's the first brainy thing<br>
you've said, Quinn.<br>
<br>
Daria: Maybe you DID learn somethin' from me.<br>
<br>
Quinn (blushing): Gee, thanks, Daria.......(laughs)<br>
<br>
Barch (to Daria):<br>
Staria, taria, Daria!!<br>
You'd best wise up, Ms. Daria Spice.<br>
You'd best wise up, it's no surprise<br>
You'd best wise up.<br>
<br>
(Back to Defoe)<br>
<br>
Defoe:<br>
And then she called out:<br>
<br>
(Back to Daria)<br>
<br>
Daria:<br>
Hey!!<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
Don't be so el stupido!!<br>
Cynics like you have got to go.<br>
<br>
Tom:<br>
You're a cruel gal, but you'd best try<br>
to respect her, Ms. Janet Barch.<br>
<br>
(Producing a remote control box with a lot of<br>
buttons on it, Barch aims it at Tom, and pushes<br>
a red button marked MEDUSA; with a zap of flashing<br>
light, Tom is turned into a statue.)<br>
<br>
Quinn:<br>
<br>
You're a cruel witch, but you'd best try<br>
to respect her, Ms. Janet Barch.<br>
<br>
(Barch turns Quinn into a statue.)<br>
<br>
Daria:<br>
You're a cruel dame--<br>
<br>
(Barch turns Daria into a statue, before smirking<br>
in triumph-----and that is when Brittany arrives on<br>
the scene.)<br>
<br>
Brittany: EEP!! That does it!! I can't take it no<br>
more!! First you rub out my Kevvy, then you take<br>
advantage of people, an' get rid of them!! An' what's<br>
worse, you've been maltreatin' your male students for<br>
years, that they've formed a Get Rid of Janet Barch<br>
Or Else Club!! An' you've been doin' so, from the first<br>
season of our show, to Is It Collage Yet? I've had it!!<br>
You've got to choose twixt me an' O'Neill an' your male<br>
hatin' tyranny!!<br>
<br>
(In reply, Barch turns Brittany into a statue,<br>
just as O'Neill, who turns off the paralyzer,<br>
freaks out at what he sees.)<br>
<br>
O'Neill: Janet, no, stop!! You've gone bananas!!<br>
<br>
Barch: Et tu, Skinny? You're next!!<br>
<br>
(You guessed it----in a flash, O'Neill is<br>
turned into a statue.)<br>
<br>
Barch: It ain't easy havin' a good time, or words<br>
to that effect. Even smilin' makes my face hurt, which<br>
is why I scowl all the time........an' my students<br>
turn against me. My Timmy's actin' just the way my<br>
no good hubby did. (To Trent and Jane) Do you think<br>
MTV made a mistake in closin' down its animation section?<br>
<br>
Jane: Ah, who cares 'bout that? When do we go<br>
back to Pennsylvania?<br>
<br>
Barch: Jane, I am indeed grateful to you an' your<br>
scum brain bro Trent. You've both served me well.<br>
Loyalty like yours should be rewarded.You may<br>
discover, when the mood takes me, I may be generous.<br>
Unless it's for a parasite of a man----an' then I get<br>
GROUCHY!!<br>
<br>
Jane: Just art supplies is all I ask.<br>
<br>
Trent: An' guitar strings.<br>
<br>
Barch: Whatever.......(heads to the elevator)<br>
It's time for the floor show!! (enters the elevator.)<br>
<br>
6TH &amp; LAST CHAPTER: Regards to Barch<br>
<br>
(Back in Defoe's art room, we see the said art<br>
teacher appraise a painting of Jane's--a painting<br>
depicting the Moulin Rouge in flames,and hit with<br>
an H bomb. After that, Defoe turns back to the camera.)<br>
<br>
Defoe: And so, by some extraordinary coincidence,<br>
fate, it seemed, had decided that Daria and Tom should<br>
keep that appointment with Quinn, but it was to be in a<br>
situation which none of them had possibly forseen.<br>
And in just a few hours, after announcing their engagement,<br>
Tom and Daria had been tempted by forbidden fruit,<br>
which was of the shallow, and the popular.<br>
That, in itself, was proof that Ms. Janet Barch was a woman<br>
of less morals----and some persuasion. What further<br>
indignities were they to be subjected to? And what of<br>
the floor show that is spoken of? In a huge mystery<br>
citidel? At night? What diabolical plan had been formed<br>
in Barch's crazed, if not perverted, mind? What indeed?<br>
From what had gone before, there was no doubt that it<br>
would be no picnic----for Barch had indeed, come up<br>
with an unholy ambition to rival the video that Mya,<br>
Lil' Kim, Pink and Cristina Aguliera did for the<br>
Moulin Rouge soundtrack........and now,the moment<br>
you've been waiting for...........the final<br>
finale........!!<br>
<br>
(In the vast theater section of the citidel, Barch,<br>
now in a gold bustier, black panty, and black thigh highs,<br>
is finishing dressing the statues in black satin bustiers,<br>
panty and thigh high sets. In one hand is the remote control<br>
unit she used to turn our Lawndalians into statues in the<br>
first place; the only difference is that Barch's thumb is<br>
poised over a green button marked DE-MEDUSA. Just as the<br>
tune starts, Barch aims the remote at Brittany, and pushes<br>
the green button, and Brittany is back to her human self----<br>
only she ain't wearing anything but the bustier/panty/<br>
thigh high set. That done, the B-gal sings.)<br>
<br>
THE FLOOR SHOW:<br>
(A) LAWNDALE MY WORLD (maybe it don't make sense,<br>
but hey....!!)<br>
Parody of Rose Tint My World<br>
Performed by Brittany Taylor,<br>
Timothy O'Neill, Tom Sloane<br>
&amp; Daria Morgendorffer<br>
<br>
Brittany:<br>
It was cool whan it all began<br>
I was a cheerleader with no tan<br>
But it was gone when I met the woman<br>
who would soon hold my mind in her hand<br>
Now the only thing that makes me see<br>
is sayin' "EEP!!" an' my Kevvy.<br>
Lawndale my world an' glory to MTV.<br>
<br>
(Barch then turns O'Neill to human form.)<br>
<br>
O'Neill:<br>
I never wanted to be a wimp<br>
but it's better than livin' as a gimp<br>
I look like a silly goon<br>
But Ms. Barch just might punch me to<br>
the moon<br>
Now the only thing that makes me stay<br>
is doin' stuff, Janet's own way<br>
Lawndale my world an' glory to MTV.<br>
<br>
(Barch aims the remote at Tom and changes<br>
him back.)<br>
<br>
Tom:<br>
It's beyond me, I just don't dig it<br>
I'll be silent, for Barch<br>
Poor Daria.<br>
We're all cuckoo<br>
What's that? Oh no!!<br>
It's a bustier!!<br>
YIPE!! Where'd we wind up,<br>
Fredricks of Lawndale?<br>
<br>
(Barch aims the remote at Daria and pushes the green<br>
button; you guessed it.)<br>
<br>
Daria:<br>
Alert Sick Sad World, for every boy an' girl!!<br>
My hair's just been curled, lipstick's on my mouth.<br>
Shades of Quinn, I am sexy; shallowness is near<br>
There goes my reputation; what would MTV say now?<br>
It's the worst!! Save the cynics!!<br>
Pagin' The Fashion Club.........!!<br>
<br>
(Behind Barch and co. , the curtains open, revealing<br>
a swimming pool, with a mosaic pattern of Ellen<br>
DeGeneres; behind the pool, is a giant Women's Lib<br>
logo. Above the logo is: FOR THE LADY LIVING ALONE:<br>
Below the logo: TAKE BACK THE NIGHT!!)<br>
<br>
(B) DON'T FREAK OUT<br>
Parody of Don't Dream It<br>
Performed by Janet Barch, Brittany<br>
Taylor, Timothy O'Neill, Daria &amp;<br>
Quinn Morgendorffer &amp; Tom Sloane<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
Whatever happened to Angela Li?<br>
That four eyed pantsuited fool.<br>
She made, on the sly<br>
big plans for Laaaaaaawndale High<br>
for all she cared for was just money<br>
Give yourself over to the power of<br>
Ms. Barch<br>
Swim the hot waters, it ain't got no starch<br>
Male hatin' nightmares, beyond any measure<br>
an' rulin' Lawndale High is yours to treasure.<br>
Forever.......can't you just see it? Oh....oh....<br>
oh........oh!!<br>
<br>
(Barch jumps in the pool, and is on a float.)<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
Don't freak out, just seek out<br>
(repeat x4)<br>
<br>
Daria, Tom, Brittany &amp; O'Neill:<br>
Don't freak out, just seek out<br>
(repeat x4)<br>
<br>
(Daria, Tom, O'Neill and Brittany all jump in the pool,<br>
mindlessly shooting each other with water squirt guns.<br>
At that moment, Barch turns to Quinn, aims the remote<br>
at her, and pushes the green button, turning her back<br>
into a human.)<br>
<br>
Quinn (spoken):<br>
What's happened to them?<br>
I've got to get them outa that place<br>
before they're transmatted to some<br>
geeky place.<br>
I've got to be strong an' hang on<br>
or else I might as well be......EW!!<br>
<br>
(Upon discovering what she's wearing, Quinn gasps.)<br>
<br>
Quinn (spoken):<br>
How'd I wind up with THAT?!? (Shrugs) At<br>
least it meets The Fashion Club's standards.<br>
<br>
(Quinn wastes no time in jumping in the pool.)<br>
<br>
Tom:<br>
Oh my oh me!! We still don't get it!!<br>
<br>
Daria:<br>
Janet Barch is a sexist.<br>
<br>
(Suddenly, Barch jumps up in the water.)<br>
<br>
(C) A WILD &amp; GROUCHY THING<br>
Parody of A Wild &amp; Untamed Thing<br>
Performed by Janet Barch, Timothy O'Neill,<br>
Daria &amp; Quinn Morgendorffer, Tom Sloane,<br>
Brittany Taylor &amp; Trent Lane<br>
<br>
(While Barch sings, the others make like they're<br>
in a water show, al la Esther Williams.)<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my,<br>
my, my!!<br>
I am a wild an' a grouchy thing<br>
A queen bee with a lethal sting<br>
I'll punch your lights out an' your head will ring<br>
For it's trouble that I will bring<br>
So let the party in Lawndale rock on<br>
We're goin' to shake it till it's way past dawn<br>
Lawndale my world an' glory to MTV.<br>
<br>
(Barch and co. all jump out from the pool, and<br>
head for the front part of the stage, doing the<br>
dance from RHPS.)<br>
<br>
Barch, O'Neill, Brittany, Daria, Quinn &amp; Tom:<br>
I am a wild an' a grouchy thing<br>
A queen bee with a lethal sting<br>
I'll punch your lights out an' your head will ring<br>
For it's trouble that I will bring<br>
So let the party in Lawndale rock on<br>
We're goin' to shake it till it's way past dawn<br>
Lawndale my world an' glory to MTV.<br>
<br>
(While Barch plays her sax with passion, Quinn does<br>
a can can dance while Brittany does her cheerleader<br>
acrobatics right down to her splits.)<br>
<br>
Barch, O'Neill, Brittany, Daria, Quinn &amp; Tom:<br>
I am a wild an' a grouchy thing<br>
A queen bee with a lethal sting<br>
I'll punch your lights out an' your head will ring<br>
For it's trouble that I will bring<br>
So let the party in Lawndale rock on<br>
We're goin' to shake it till it's way past dawn,<br>
dawn, dawn<br>
Lawndale my world an' glory to MTV.<br>
<br>
(Suddenly the double doors of the theater facing the<br>
stage burst open, and Jane and Trent, wearing the gold<br>
and black space outfits worn by Riff Raff and Mangenta<br>
in RHPS step in. They're also carrying 5 foot long<br>
black colored steel rifle type weapons with huge triggers,<br>
laser sights and a machine gun type muzzle-----words<br>
just don't describe them. Anyhow, Trent states to Barch,<br>
which is also my fave part in RHPS.)<br>
<br>
Trent:<br>
Ms. Janet Barch, it's all over!!<br>
You're nuttin' but a bully!!<br>
Your bigotry's extreme.<br>
As your former student,<br>
you're bound for unemployment!!<br>
We return to Pennsylvania.<br>
Prepare the transit beam........!!<br>
<br>
Barch: Shaddap Trent!!<br>
<br>
Trent: No, YOU shaddap, you hypocrite male hatin'<br>
teacher!! It's all over but the shoutin'.<br>
<br>
Jane: There's two of us an' one of you, which means the<br>
odds stand on our side.<br>
<br>
Barch: But with my marital arts training in my Take<br>
Back The Night project, I can reduce those odds.<br>
<br>
Trent: Not when we've got these.<br>
<br>
(He and Jane aim their rifles at Barch, who, discovering<br>
the jig is up, freaks out. Jane turns to go, but Barch<br>
calls out.)<br>
<br>
Barch: Wait!! I can explain everything.......!!<br>
(To O'Neill and Brittany)Skinny, Brittany,<br>
switch on the lights.<br>
<br>
O'Neill &amp; Brittany: OK, boss.<br>
<br>
(The spotlights settle on Barch, who does a<br>
stirring perfomance.)<br>
<br>
I'VE JUST BEEN FIRED<br>
Parody of I Am Going Home<br>
Performed by Janet Barch<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
On the day, I went away.....<br>
<br>
Daria, Quinn, Tom, Brittany &amp; O'Neill:<br>
Goodby.......<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
was all Ms. Li had to say...<br>
<br>
Daria, Quinn, Tom, Brittany &amp; O'Neill:<br>
Now I .......<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
am on the bread line, like my spouse.<br>
<br>
Daria, Quinn, Tom, Brittany &amp; O'Neill:<br>
Oh, my, my.......<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
I just wanna track down that<br>
crummy louse........!!<br>
For I've seen.........gray skies!!<br>
An' the hate in my eyes.<br>
An' I realize........I've just been fired.<br>
<br>
Daria, Quinn, Tom, Brittany &amp; O'Neill:<br>
I've just been fired.<br>
<br>
(Barch stands up; in her mind, she can<br>
see all the Lawndalians seated in the audience.)<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
Everywhere, the Lawndale Lions shout out "Shame!!"<br>
<br>
Daria, Quinn, Tom, Brittany &amp; O'Neill:<br>
Feelin'.............<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
Like a harpy in the rain<br>
<br>
Daria, Quinn, Tom, Brittany &amp; O'Neill:<br>
Treatin'.........<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
Male students like trash, just like on The<br>
Blame Game.<br>
<br>
Daria, Quinn, Tom, Brittany &amp; O'Neill:<br>
Dealin'..........<br>
<br>
Barch:<br>
Cards for Trent an' cards for Jane.<br>
For I've seen...........gray skies!!<br>
An' the hate in my eyes.<br>
An' I realize...........I've just been fired.<br>
<br>
Barch, Daria, Quinn, Tom, Brittany &amp; O'Neill:<br>
I've just been fired<br>
I've just been fired<br>
I've just been..........fired..........<br>
<br>
(Thunderous applause fills the theater till it's<br>
replaced by the sound of fainthowling wind-------<br>
just as Jane's voice breaks into Barch's reverie.)<br>
<br>
Jane: How sentimental........<br>
<br>
(You can imagine Barch's shock when she sees the<br>
audience seats empty; only Jane and Trent remain,<br>
and they waste no time in approaching the sadist<br>
teacher.)<br>
<br>
Trent: An' also presumptuous of you.<br>
<br>
Barch: Shaddap, Trent!!<br>
<br>
Trent: No, YOU shaddap. In fact you've said that to me an'<br>
every male student of Lawndale High for the last time<br>
----an' with good reason; y'see, when I said we'd return<br>
to Pennsylvania, I referred ONLY to Janey an' me. Sorry<br>
if my statement was misleading, but YOU were to remain<br>
here in Lawndale......(Trent aims his rifle at Barch)<br>
.........in spirit anyway.......<br>
<br>
Quinn: YIPE!! It's a phaser!!<br>
<br>
Trent: Right, Quinn. Phaser, short for PHASed Energy<br>
Rectification. Behold our digital xenon strobe 7000<br>
caliber phaser rifle, capable of emitting hyper lethal<br>
ion pulse phaser firepower, fortified with energy from<br>
the decibels of Metallica, Rammstein, Powerman 5000, an'<br>
Megadeth----so now, you know.<br>
<br>
Daria: And knowing is half the battle.<br>
<br>
Jane: Good one, Daria. (Laughs)<br>
<br>
Tom: Y-you mean you're going to kill her?<br>
(points to Barch)<br>
<br>
Trent: What do you think?<br>
<br>
Tom: I should know better, but what was her crime?<br>
<br>
Quinn: You should know, T.S. , DUH!! You saw what<br>
happened to Kevin.That, an' the way she treated the<br>
3 J's at Lawndale High!! She deserves it!! The world<br>
must be protected----even if it means resorting to so<br>
called necessary evils.<br>
<br>
Trent: Exactly, Quinn. Good one though. (Laugh/coughs.)<br>
<br>
Daria: I got to admit, it's the second brainy thing you said.<br>
<br>
Quinn: Gee, thanks. (Laughs while she blushes.)<br>
<br>
Trent (to Barch): An' now, Janet Barch, for all<br>
the male students of Lawndale High, your time<br>
hath come. Say adios to (he gestures with his rifle)<br>
all that.......an' hola......to oblivion.<br>
<br>
(Without warning, a shrieking Brittany runs in<br>
between the Lane siblings and Barch.)<br>
<br>
Brittany (Shrieking): AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!<br>
Stop!! There'll be no deaths here!! STOP!!!!!<br>
<br>
Jane: Now can we put her out of her misery?<br>
<br>
Trent: Make it so, Number One.<br>
<br>
Jane: Aye, aye, Captain------settin' the phasers to kill.<br>
<br>
(Jane and Trent aim their rifles at Brittany and fire<br>
salvo after salvo of phaserbolts which impale her heart;<br>
she falls to the floor, convulsing.)<br>
<br>
Brittany (gasping): Hang on, Kevvy........I am<br>
comin' to join you........!!S- see you in Hell......!!<br>
(Collapses to the floor, dead; soon after that, the<br>
Lanes take aim at Barch.)<br>
<br>
Trent: Now, Barch........you!!<br>
<br>
Barch:Oh-oh.......................!!<br>
<br>
(Barch runs for the back of the stage and climbs<br>
the Women's Lib logo,only for Jane and Trent to<br>
shoot her down. Dying, she falls into the pool.)<br>
<br>
O'Neill: Oh my gosh!! You killed Janet!! You bastard!!<br>
<br>
(As you can guess, O'Neill retrieves Barch's dead<br>
body from the pool, and carrying her, tries to<br>
climb the logo; to cut a long story short,<br>
Jane and Trent fire over 24 phaserbolts before<br>
O'Neill meets the same fate as Barch. Their dead<br>
bodies now float in the pool.)<br>
<br>
Daria: I call that a 9.4 on the Olympic score.<br>
<br>
Quinn: EW!! Dead bodies again!!<br>
<br>
Jane: I thought you liked them.<br>
They liked you.<br>
<br>
Trent (shouting): THEY DIDN'T LIKE ME!!<br>
SHE NEVER LIKED ME!!<br>
<br>
Daria: That Barch never liked the males<br>
at Lawndale High either.<br>
<br>
Tom: Even after MTV got rid of our show,<br>
you two did what no one could do------you<br>
finally got rid of that sadist teacher.<br>
<br>
Quinn: AAAAA-MEN!! You did good. For artsy<br>
folks, you're OK by me.<br>
<br>
Trent: Quinn, we're sorry 'bout Kevin.<br>
<br>
Jane: Ditto. Don't worry 'bout the bodies,<br>
we'll deal with them.<br>
<br>
All your clothing an' your stuff is waitin' in the main foyer.<br>
<br>
Trent: Amen, Janey. (to Quinn) You should leave,<br>
Quinn, while you still can.We're 'bout to beam<br>
the citidel to the planet Mystik in the galaxy<br>
of Pennsylvania. Go.......(gestures with his<br>
rifle.) Now!!<br>
<br>
Daria: Step on it, all of you, they ain't jokin' !!<br>
<br>
Tom: I hope I get paid big time at MTV's offices.<br>
<br>
Quinn: Feets, don't fail me now.<br>
<br>
(After Tom, Daria and Quinn hightail it out<br>
from the theater, Trent and Jane grin at each other.)<br>
<br>
Trent: Our noble mission is completed,<br>
my most artful sis, an' soon we will return<br>
to the grunge an' Alterna Palooza sound of our beloved planet.<br>
<br>
Jane: Ah, sweet Mystik, land of art an' rock.<br>
To sing an' dance once more to Mystik Sprial's<br>
refrain.......to deal with that------strum to the right.....<br>
<br>
(We see the Lawndalians dance in the<br>
ballroom, then we switch back to Trent and Jane.)<br>
<br>
Trent &amp; Jane: YO!!<br>
<br>
Trent:......an' with those decibels.......<br>
<br>
(Back to the Lawndalians.)<br>
<br>
The Lawndalians: It's sure to drive you insane.....!!<br>
<br>
Jane: An' our world........<br>
<br>
(Back to the Lanes.)<br>
<br>
Jane (continued):.....will head to The Sprial Warp......again!!<br>
<br>
(The Lanes laugh crazily while outside,<br>
Daria, Tom and Quinn, carrying their stuff and<br>
clothing can be seen outside the citidel.<br>
Ahead, we see the dead bodies of Barch, O'Neill,<br>
Brittany and Kevin; from of the citidel's<br>
buildings, a phaser cannon takes aim,<br>
and opens fire, turing the dead into<br>
a roaring funeral pyre.)<br>
<br>
Quinn: EW!!!!<br>
<br>
Daria: Sure saves a lot on funeral expenses.<br>
<br>
(At that moment, the citidel, high<br>
wall and all, rises up several feet, a<br>
transparent green sphere forms,<br>
enveloping the whole kit and kaboodle,<br>
before taking off fast like a rocket,<br>
hurtling up in the sky till it's gone.)<br>
<br>
Daria: What an exit. Well, let's go into<br>
the sunrise.<br>
<br>
Tom: How? Remember, I've got four<br>
flat tires.<br>
<br>
Quinn: Quinn to the rescue--------<br>
follow me.<br>
<br>
(Quinn leads Daria and Tom to where<br>
Sandi's car is waiting.)<br>
<br>
Tom: Ain't that Sandi's car?<br>
<br>
Quinn: Yup. I borrowed it from her, in<br>
exchange for my back issues of Waif.<br>
<br>
Daria: You mean you can drive legally?<br>
<br>
Quinn: Gosh, Daria, what do you think people<br>
do on dates? Besides, don't you remember?<br>
The Fashion Club an' Aunt Amy taught me to<br>
drive till I got my license.<br>
<br>
Daria: (sigh) Go figure. Let's go.<br>
<br>
(And so, with Quinn at the wheel, she, Daria<br>
and Tom head back to Lawndale, into,the rising<br>
sun of morning in triumph.)<br>
<br>
DARIA'S HEROES<br>

(Just before Sandi's car fades into the sunrise,<br>
we hear Quinn.)<br>
<br>
Quinn: Is it collage yet?<br>
<br>
Daria: Whoo-hoo....<br>
<br>
(Back at the art room, Defoe is back at Jane's<br>
Arts &amp; Crass painting.)<br>
<br>
Defoe: "She knows she's a winner, she couldn't<br>
be thinner, for she's careful what she eats<br>
for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Good nutrition<br>
rules."(Sighs) No wonder Jane chickened out<br>
from the contest.......(To the camera)Well,<br>
that is our story. Thanks for coming here,<br>
I think. Good night.<br>
<br>
(Defoe exits the art room before the lights go<br>
out; all we can see is the illuminated world<br>
globe before it's changed for the credits and<br>
the alteregos of our Lawndalians-------Daria<br>
as Robotech's Lisa Hayes, Kevin as The Tin Man<br>
from The Wizard Of Oz, Brittany as an Italian<br>
