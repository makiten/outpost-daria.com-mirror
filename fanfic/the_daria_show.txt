SCENE ONE: Classroom
MR. O'NEILL: Class, ITC is looking for a student to host a talk show and
             they've asked me if I know anybody.  I am thinking about one of
             you and that one of you is Daria Morgendorfer.
DARIA: Excuse me.
JANE: Isn't that a public access station?
DARIA: Yeah.
MR. O'NEILL: Yes.
DARIA: I don't believe this.
QUINN: I know!  That's not fair.
MR. O'NEILL: They want someone smart and intelligent.
DARIA: So why'd you pick me?
MR. O'NEILL: Well.  You were the only person that fit those specifications.
JANE: In the whole school?
MR. O'NEILL: Well, no.
DARIA: Then why'd you pick me?
MR. O'NEILL: Because all the other candidates are either freaky goth chicks or
             fans of "Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers".
KEVIN: Ooh!  Which series?
JANE: Oh brother.
MR. O'NEILL: Oh dear.

SCENE TWO: TV Studio
PRODUCER: You must be the talk show host that freak Mr. O'Neill sent over.
          What's your name?  Darcy?
DARIA: That's Daria.
PRODUCER: Oh.
DARIA: Okay.  Let's get this thing started.
PRODUCER: Okay.  This is your set.  You will be interviewing locals in the
          news.  As a matter of fact, the show is called "Locals In The News".
DARIA: This set is just a set of a room in a skyscraper with a bad skyline
       impersonation in the back.
PRODUCER: And why do you not think that fits with the talk show scenario?
DARIA: Oh.  I see.
PRODUCER: Okay.  You'll first episode will be taped in just a few moments.
          Well, are you ready?
DARIA: Yeah.  Hey.  Who will my guests be for the first episode?
PRODUCER: Let's see.  First up, there's Charles Olan.  He is the guy that
          broke the pie eating world record.
DARIA: Oh.  Yum.
PRODUCER: Barry Moore.  He is the editor of the town paper.
DARIA: Yeah.
PRODUCER: And for your musical guest, Mystic Spiral.
DARIA: Excuse me?
PRODUCER: Have you heard of them?
DARIA: Huh.  I mean, no.
PRODUCER: Oh.  Hey!  Here comes the lead singer.
TRENT: Hey Daria.  What are you doing here?
PRODUCER: So you do know each other?  Um, Daria is hosting the show.
TRENT: Oh.
PRODUCER: Well.  We better get started.
DARIA: Great.

SCENE THREE: Morgendorfer Living Room
QUINN: Why does the station make her wear that?
DAD: God.  It's a cult.
MOM: It's not a cult, Jake.  It's a television station that has really bad
     taste in costumes.
QUINN: You've got that right.
MOM: Who is this band?  There terrible.
QUINN: Some guys named Mystic Spiral.
DAD: Mystic Spiral.  Sounds like a drug.
MOM: Oh it's not a drug, Jake.
DAD: Oh!  Oh.
(Daria walks in)
MOM: It was a great show, Daria.
DARIA: It was not.
MOM: I know.
DAD: I can't wait to see it next week.
DARIA: It won't be on next week.  It was cancelled.
MOM: On the first night?
DARIA: Yeah.
QUINN: It must have really sucked.
DARIA: I know.

SCENE FOUR: Cafeteria
JANE: So your show got cancelled on the first night?
DARIA: Yeah.  But I don't care.
JANE: Yeah.  You shouldn't.
DARIA: I know.
JANE: Hey.  Look on the bright side.  Now you can fullfill your dream and
      become a drunken cross-dressing circus clown touring an unknow foreign
      country.
