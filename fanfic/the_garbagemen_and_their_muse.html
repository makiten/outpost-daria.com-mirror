William J. Ullman IV and Robert Walls had been riding the pickup route together
for the Twin-Counties Consolidated Sanitation District, Inc. on this side of
Lawndale for the past three years. No big. Nothing unusual, nothing special. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Today was
Thursday. Thursdays were special. Thursdays were the day they ran past the
Morgendorffer house. Oh, yeah. The Morgendorffer house, just before
seven-thirty, no matter whether it was raining, or snowing, or the sun was just
coming over the horizon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Two years ago,
last September. The second Thursday of the month. Windy day, overcast, slight
sprinkles. That's when garbage pickup on Thursdays became special. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Beforehand, it was
a decent gig. Once you joined the union, pay was twenty-three bucks an hour,
plus full benefits, (the dental plan ROCKED!) your birthday counted as an extra
personal day that you could take whenever you needed, and best of all, they
front-loaded your vacation days at the beginning of the year so you could plan
ahead. (The last Director tried to switch over to a new vacation plan; 3.69
hours of vacation time was added to your book every pay period, and you could
only take your vacation after your original date of hire. He got canned three
weeks later.) Starting pay was still a damn good seventeen-eighty - and they
put you on the medical/dental plan right away. The deductible was only fifty bucks.
If you signed on with TCCSD, it's because you knew somebody. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Will was pulling
down union pay, and he only worked part-time. He knew somebody. The Regent at
Lawndale State University had planned to slide a football player named Sherman
into the spot, but he rolled his eyes at the Regent and walked out of his
office at the offer. He got killed in a freak accident a week or so later, and
the Regent's ex-wife mentioned Will's name at a luncheon. She wanted him to
have some decent spending money and some different experiences than the usual
artsy kids got. Besides, she wanted Will to stay in shape - no 'dorm gut' for
him, especially since he was an art major, and spent as much time as he could
indoors with his paints and canvas. Anna Josephine Cardeau was French Canadian,
an especially frisky forty years of age, with a face and figure of a woman
fifteen years younger - and plans for the extraordinarily talented
eighteen-year-old. Getting him to enroll at Lawndale State University instead
of an Ivy League school wasn't easy, until his family found that LSU had a
world-class arts program. Before that, the furthest down the list they'd let
him seriously consider was a place called BFAC.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The Regent didn't
have a problem with the suggestion. He didn't have to pay alimony, because Anna
probably had more money when she was twenty than he'd probably ever have in his
entire life, and every now and again, she slinked into his office, nostalgic
and playful...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>'Old Bobby', as
the boys called him jokingly, was in his mid-forties, a fireplug of a man. He
was barely five-five, two hundred pounds on the dot, with a barrel of a chest,
arms that looked like he could crack a walnut in his elbow joint, and chocolate
skin that was touched in several black spots by the results of adult acne. His
hair was cut short but neat, and he didn't even seem to care about how his
hairline was receding. His forgettable brown eyes, however, occasionally danced
with a faraway light that made him seem not so ordinary; he was the Jerry to
William's Tom. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>When Will showed
up for his first day, Old Bobby took a liking to the nineteen-year-old right
away, even though he was 'tall, skinny, and pretty enough to be a prison prom
queen - better not get into any real trouble before you go home back East,
boy!' Will shot back by reaching into his ever-present backpack for a
sketchpad; when Old Bobby asked what he was doing, he said that he needed to
sketch out some simians in their natural habitat and this wasn't an opportunity
to be missed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Old Bobby threw it
right back, with diction that threw him for a loop. &quot;Long, straight hair.
Lots of body hair. Thin, straight lips. Now, who in this room DOESN'T
immediately exhibit those specific simian body characteristics?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Will flinched for
a brief moment. He was easily one of the most handsome young men in his high
school, with dark hair, cerulean eyes that held tiny gold flecks, and a face
that reminded EVERYONE who saw him of a young John F. Kennedy. His looks, while
ensuring that he'd NEVER gone a single weekend since his sixteenth birthday
without a date (he just didn't think about girls during the month before a
semester's end, so he could actually have time to just paint without being
bothered), also made sure that he didn't get taken seriously about a lot of
things. He still shuddered when he thought about the day he told his family
that he was seriously considering doing a three-year turn in the Army, and he
could do some work as a cartoonist for the 'Army Times'...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Several quite
erudite comments flashed through his mind for a response, but something else
pushed them aside; he looked Old Bobby straight in the eye and said, &quot;Your
momma.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>They stuck him in
a truck with Old Bobby, who just couldn't stop laughing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Years later, he
ended his retelling of his first day by saying, &quot;I guess I said the right
thing.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>They did their
entire route in two and a half hours (one and a half to two on light days, four
on heavy or bad-weather days), and spent the rest of their time talking and
going over whatever interesting tidbit one or the other had come up with the
previous day. If it had ever crossed their minds to do a talk show, they'd have
put Regis and Kelly on the street.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The secret to the
boys' success at finishing up so fast? Old Bobby drove his truck through his
route like a he was flying a Huey into hot LZ's in the Mekong Delta. 40 to zero
- Billy hopped off. Dump the trash. Drop the cans back in place. Screw the
lids. Hop back on. Zero to 40. Switch often as needed. Repeat until done. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Will almost didn't
make it through his first month. He only kept going because he wasn't going to
see the looks on the guys' faces when he went in to pick up his last check. He
didn't know if that was being brave, being cowardly, or being a putz. The guys
watched the way he worked, and knew that he wasn't going out like a punk. Who
cared if he looked like a Chippendale? - the kid could do his job, and he
didn't bitch. He kept going through sheer willpower, and lost twenty pounds.
Old Billy slowed it down to 25 at the beginning of the kid's fifth week, and
Will came into the commons room that Friday to find a coffee mug with a Warhol
of the Campbell's soup can on it in his mug's spot. The kid was okay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>After working with
Old Bobby for a full school year, Will could press one hundred pounds more than
he could the previous August, put on twenty pounds of solid muscle, and had a
good deal more stamina. Anna was so happy after her visit to Will's apartment
before he went home for the summer that she sent a case of Bollinger's to Old
Bobby's home, and spent the weekend bounding around the Regent's house like she
was seventeen and frolicking through her aunt's Marseilles summer home once
again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Old Bobby donated
it to the 'Take Back The Night' fundraiser auction sponsored by the Lawndale
Divorced Women's Empowerment Circle. He had a sense of irony.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>They were about a
third of the way through the route when the pile of boxes at the curbside
caught their attention. &quot;Someone's moved into the Shyres' place,&quot; Old
Bobby noticed, slowing down. &quot;I guess they moved in over the weekend; look
at the way the squirrels have gotten into the trash.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;In this
neighborhood? Boy, if we were over in Crewe Neck, they'd EXPECT it!&quot; came
the response. &quot;That's why you're pulling down what you do, boy. Get your

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The truck pulled
to a stop, and Will narrowed his eyes at the feel of the stinging droplets of
rain. &quot;I hate it when it rains like this,&quot; he said, grabbing at a box
and flinging it in the back of the truck. &quot;So, the twins moved,
right?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Stop
thinking about every little piece that comes along,&quot; Old Bobby barked, the
memory of the identical pair of tall, buxom, chestnut haired teens still fresh
in his head. &quot;They both changed over to USC when their mother got
transferred to Edwards Air Force Base. I bet they're all happier, though,
because they can probably afford to put Mr. Shyres' mom into a home or something.
They both got full rides in pre-med.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Yes,
probably,&quot; was all Old Bobby would say on that topic. Will had the
sneaking suspicion that somehow, he'd been invited in to read some of Mrs.
Shyres' poetry, and the schizophrenic's work bothered him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>It had come up one
day at work that Old Bobby was a poet of no small talent. Will asked if anyone
had any of his stuff that he could look at, and was confused when the commons
room filled up with laughter...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Old Bobby never
wrote down or saved his poems. 'Poetry is the same as a flowers from a garden,'
he said, when Billy asked him about it. 'Enjoy it in the moment, and then, let
it go. There are fewer things as sad as going over a poem again, and again, and
again. Enjoy them, and if you must - if you have to - take one and press it in
a book, because it has a personal meaning to you alone. There will always be
more flowers, and some will actually be beautiful.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>When Old Bobby
talked like that, Billy understood why they called him that. Old soul; somebody
who'd seen a lot. Old Bobby would have gone over big in the sixties. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Lexus, Range
Rover - they're not hurting any,&quot; Bobby said, looking over the two cars in
the open garage before turning back to his work. &quot;Microwave lasagna - a

Viagara prescription slip, another one for birth control, fish sticks in

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The canvas
depicted an idealized Helen, painted as emerging from the front door of <i>Schloss

Of Venus', her usual business suit replaced by flowing robes of the same color
as her favorite suit &ndash; albeit covering her so as to exhibit... well, a depiction
of her figure that Helen would never take offense to &ndash; well, never in private.
A conch shell of pearl and golden swirls held close to her ear replaced the
ever-present cell phone, and although the scene depicted a rainstorm, the
droplets of rain seemed to take pains to avoid the woman and her barely-visible
aura...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The waiting Range
Rover was now the chariot of Apollo, with an aura similar to Helen's about the
heads of the stallions as they trumpeted a greeting, wisps of flame coming from
nostrils and eyes. Just behind Helen, a two-headed Jake stood, with one
doe-eyed head weeping and extending the right hand out for her, while the
second head, it's eyes curiously shaded from view by shadow, spewed forth a
burning U.S. flag from its mouth, holes burning through it like acid as it
wrapped around Jake's throats and made it's way into the darkness, where a
decaying hand and forearm in Marine Corps dress blues came forth and held the
end of the flag like a leash. A brilliant red dummy cord held a pacifier
connected to Jake's left wrist, with a gin bottle leaking the same liquid the
pacifier was filled with on the floor, and a. Roman-era dagger was in Jake's
left hand, albeit held with the blade pointed away from Helen. Jane suppressed
a shudder as she saw the way the second head was tilted towards Helen's back,
where a thin, wispy abstraction that might have been the shape of another man
seemed to be a part of Helen's halo, positioned behind her, directly between
her and Jake... and it held a conch shell as if it were mirroring Helen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The upstairs
windows were both enlarged to ridiculous extremes. In one, a radiant
child-goddess was seen looking towards the sun, and rain refused to fall upon
that window. Three young women surrounded her; one tried to block the sunlight
falling on Quinn, yet her own face remained in shadow. The second one was
perfect in every way, but had no face, and the third wore a brilliant, yet
hooded robe that hid a face that was more beautiful than any other in the
painting. Just outside and above the window, three young men held weapons as if
trying to fight the rain; one was falling from his perch, another shrieked as
lightning struck his weapon, and one actually seemed to sneak a peek at the
girl in shadow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Jane looked closer
at the face of Quinn, it was smiling as it seemed to look out into the distance
and the sunlight that lit the horizon, but at the very edge of her right eye,
so small that one had to look close to see it... a single tear was forming. Jane
followed the gaze, and saw a figure just at the horizon; looking closely, she
could see that the figure was carrying scrolls...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

attention to the other window &ndash; and drew back in shock. The rain was falling
heavily across the second window, and as she moved back to study the images,
she saw herself &ndash; a perfect representation, without embellishment, and the only
thing well lit in the room. She sat on the edge of the bed, while a second
figure<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&ndash; one wearing Doc Martens boots
and holding a pen that dripped acid that ate through the floor, but otherwise
shrouded in darkness - sat next to her. The two figures shared what had to be a
roll of cookie dough as the ceiling-mounted TV displayed the unmistakable
opening graphic of <i>Sick, Sad World</i>... In a mirror aside the bed, the
reflection of Daria, a spectacularly beautiful image WITH glasses on, could be
seen opposite the shadowed figure, and the door to the closet was also seen.
Strangely enough, a series of metallic plates (by the reflection) covered the
entire area of the doorframe, and the plates seemed to all swirl in towards the
center like an iris, or the aperture on the &ndash;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
