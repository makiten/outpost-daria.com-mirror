</p>

<hr>

<p><u>Disclaimer #1:</u> Some of what you are about to read is
supposed to take place in Season Number Five. However since it
was originally conceived on June 23, 2000, everything you already
know about the proper fifth season of Daria should be overlooked
in order for this to work. </p>

<hr>

<p><br>
<u>Plot Summary:</u> Lawndale High gets a new kid, who's got a
bad habit of talking back to the faculty. This trait proves to be
quite admirable to many of the students, including Daria, as he
tells off teachers like Ms. Barch, and Ms. Li. But where does his
hostility come from? Will we find out when Daria is forced to
tutor him by Mr. O'Neill? Meanwhile, Mystik Spiral is teaming up
with a more successful ska band for a duet album. <br>

<p>STANDARD DARIA THEME SONG AND SEQUENCES. <br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><br>
Scene One/Act One:<br>
(Shot of Casa Lane, with music blaring from the basement, then
Jane's room) <br>
The same ritual -- Jane paints, Daria writes, as usual.<br>
<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;So, did you decide which conspiracy theory you
were going to debunk for your homework assignment tonight?&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;It was a tough decision, but I went along
with an easy one. The myth that the Apollo 11 Moon Landing was a
hoax.&quot;<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;Oh, so disproving racial and ethnic supremacy
is too difficult, huh? I say it's probably true. America was
losing the Vietnam War and needed something to boost the world's
confidence in freedom. So they marched down to Area 51 and staged
this whole fake moon landing to try to win the public's hearts
and minds.&quot; <br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;If that were the case, the Soviet Union would
be exposing this so-called fake moon landing to the world right
after we landed there.&quot;<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;Damn. You always find a way to spoil popular
opinion.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Oh, that's not the only fact I'm going to
use.&quot;<br>
<br>
(An interesting set of notes begins emitting from the basement.
Quite unusual for Mystik Spiral's sound.)<br>
<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Is that my imagination, or has Mystik Spiral
converted into a ska band?&quot;<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;Neither. Trent agreed to get the band to do a
duet with a more successful local band. And they happen to be
into ska.&quot;(1)<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;I'm surprised he was able to convince the
rest of the band to go along with it.&quot;<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p>Scene Two:<br>
(The Lane basement)<br>
Mystik Spiral is in the basement, but they're not performing.
Instead a seven-man ska-reggae band of three mulattos, two blacks
and two whites is playing while the Spiral supervises. The band
teaming up with Mystik Spiral is finishing up their cover of
&quot;Mr. Normal,&quot; as Daria &amp; Jane are entering the
basement.<br>
<br>
<u>Ska Musicians(singing):</u> &quot;Hey, Mr. Normal. It was
YOU!!&quot;<br>
<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;That song does transcend every
counter-culture, doesn't it?&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Too bad it'll eventually be watered-down and
commercialized, so it can be used as a jingle to sell luxury
performance sedans and sport utility vehicles.&quot;<br>
<u>Trent:</u> &quot;Not too soon, I hope. Perhaps when we're
dead, or too old to rock.&quot;<br>
<u>Sax-O-Geranium:</u> &quot;Hey, if it's good enough for the
people, it shouldn't be commercialized at all.&quot;<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;Daria, meet The Golden Drying Board?&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;'The Golden Drying Board?' What kind of a
name is that?&quot;<br>
<u>Q.T. Ugly:</u> &quot;If you think that's a bad name, we used
to call ourselves 'The Arthur Bremer Society'.&quot; (2) <br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Sounds too much like 'Jodie Foster's Army,'
huh?&quot;<br>
<u>Q.T.:</u> &quot;Errr, yeah.&quot;<br>
<u>Fishplant:</u> &quot;Q.T. Ugly's the name of my bass player,
and this is my band. You see, we think ska has lost a lot of its
reggae origins, and has inadvertently fueled the swing revival of
the 1990's. Our band is dedicated to recapturing those origins,
but for now we decided to team up with a band from our hometown
that we like, and Mystik Spiral is it.&quot; <br>
<u>Max:</u> &quot;The concept of the album is for us to do grunge
versions of Golden Drying Board songs, and for them to do ska
versions of Spiral songs.&quot; <br>
<u>Trent:</u> &quot;...Plus some team-ups, original works, and
other stuff.&quot;<br>
<u>Q.T.:</u> &quot;You guys ever do any cover tunes?&quot;<br>
<u>Trent:</u> &quot;Normally, no. But we've got a faster version
of 'Heart-Shaped Box,' by Nirvana.&quot;<br>
<u>Jesse:</u> &quot;With a longer instrumental break.&quot;<br>
<u>Fishplant:</u> &quot;Alright, man. I think we can handle that.
Let's start the recording.&quot;<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;So, do you guys have a name for this proposed
album?&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;How about, 'The Empty Promises of a Fuller
Life'?&quot;<br>
<u>Trent</u>(<i>laughing, then coughing</i>): &quot;Good one,
Daria. We should use it for The Spiral's <i>next</i> album.&quot;<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p>Scene Three:<br>
[Song: &quot;Heart-Shaped Box,&quot; by Nirvana].<br>
(Next Morning, Lawndale High)<br>
<br>
<u>Ms. Barch:</u> &quot;Class, we have a new student. Meet Harry
Whitford.&quot;<br>
(Camera turns to a skinny white boy with a dirty-blonde mop-top,
wearing blue jeans and a blank, medium-blue tee shirt with a
pocket on his chest.) <br>
<u>Harry</u>(<i>raising his hand, casually</i>): &quot;Hi.&quot; <br>
<u>Ms. Barch</u>(<i>suddenly snapping</i>): &quot;Alright, that's
enough from <b><i>you</i></b>!&quot;<br>
(Harry is surprised and annoyed at this unwarranted attack).<br>
<u>Ms. Barch:</u> &quot;Now today we're going to talk about the
East African Widowbird; The East African Widowbird comes from the
grebe family, and is named because of its mating habits. (<i>begins
ranting</i>) The usual male habits of running around, sowing his
wild oats, and leaving the mate with neglected children, to fool
around with some floozy-bird, who's still in college, and was
recently elected Playmate of the Year!&quot;<br>
(Ms. Barch suddenly zeros in on Harry).<br>
<u>Ms. Barch:</u> &quot;Shut up, you <b><i>man</i></b>!&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Hey, I didn't say <i>anything</i>.&quot;<br>
<u>Ms. Barch</u>(<i>screeching</i>): &quot;<b><i>SHUT UP!!</i></b>&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;But I...&quot;<br>
<u>Ms. Barch:</u> &quot;I <i>said</i> shut your lying, cheating
two-timing, widow-making <b><i>trap</i></b>!!&quot; <br>
(Harry is now disgusted with her attitude toward him)<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Ahh, Ram it up your hole!!&quot;<br>
(class is horrified)<br>
<u>Ms. Barch:</u> &quot;You <i>dare</i> talk back to me?&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;What? You've never had a kid do it <i>before</i>?
Well maybe <i>some</i> of them should start giving it a <b><i>try</i></b>!&quot;<br>
(class becomes more excited, some are horrified, but others are
impressed)<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Looks like this boy thinks he can stand up to
the Wrath of Barch.&quot;<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;I'd say he's doing a pretty good job of it so
far.&quot;<br>
<br>
(Janet grabs something off a yellow pad of paper, takes an ink
pad and a stamp which we later find is customized with her
signature on it. We now see that the yellow piece of paper is a
detention slip. She approaches Harry and grabs him by the
shoulders, putting that slip of paper in his pocket.)<br>
<br>
<u>Ms. Barch:</u> &quot;Take this to the principal's office right
now! The directions are on the back, assuming you <i>men</i> can
follow them!&quot; <br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Nice knowing you, Ms. Bitch.&quot;<br>
<br>
(Harry walks out with his back turned and two obscene gestures
high over his head. A few kids laugh, some kids gasp and others
groan.)<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p>Scene Four:<br>
(The Halls of Lawndale High, Daria's locker &amp; vicinity)<br>
Daria opens her locker and finds a bouquet of flowers in a
six-ounce cup and a flattering note that reads &quot;I knew girls
as lovely as you existed, but I never knew I'd actually meet one.
Signed, A. Friend.&quot; She closes her locker, turns her head
and sees Upchuck, who's smiling semi-innocently. <br>
<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;I suppose you <i>know</i> what I think of
these flowers, Upchuck&#133;and where you can stick them.&quot;<br>
<u>Upchuck:</u> &quot;I told you before, I'm over you, Daria. Not
that you're not an attractive woman, but as you recall, I did
meet somebody during that football game with Highland, a while
back.&quot;(3)<br>
<u>Daria</u>(<i>grabs his neck preparing to strangle him</i>):
&quot;How do I know that you're not just adding her and I to that
harem you've always wanted?&quot; <br>
<u>Upchuck</u>(<i>gagging</i>): &quot;Because I no longer feel
the need for a harem.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria</u>(<i>loosening her grip slightly</i>): &quot;Keep
talking.&quot;<br>
<u>Upchuck:</u> &quot;When a man acts the way I do, it's usually
to win the hand of a woman he seeks. You meet my standards, but
so does Donna Tilove. <i>She</i> just happens to appreciate me
for who I am, therefore I have no motive to try to win <i>your</i>
heart, or the heart of any other young lady at this school.&quot;<br>
(Daria is still suspicious, but realizes he has a point)<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Alright, I'll let go. But you have to promise
that if you two break up, you won't turn to me or Jane when
you're on the rebound.&quot; <br>
<br>
(camera widens to reveal Ms. Li approaching)<br>
<u>Ms. Li:</u> &quot;Miss Morgendorffer! How dare you try to
strangle that boy! He's got an important football game to
announce this weekend. I'm afraid you'll have to come with
me.&quot;<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p>Scene Five:<br>
[Song: &quot;Your Number or Your Name,&quot; by The Knack.].<br>
(Jane's House, Jane's Room)<br>
Like Scene one, Jane's painting while Daria's doing homework.<br>
<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;And you're sure Upchuck's not your secret
admirer.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Not entirely. But he did have a plausible
alibi, so I let it slide. That was when Ms. Li caught me.&quot;<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;Yeah, I heard. So, how was your first time by
yourself in after-school detention?&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;It's <i>not</i> my first time. Anyway, it was
boring, tedious, and it put me to sleep. So I'd say it was just
like the rest of our school day.&quot;<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;I'm glad you've got some sense of what a trip
to the principal's office is really like, so I wouldn't have to
prove to you it's not like a dungeon. &quot; <br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;I knew it long before I joined you in your
controversial artistic excursions.&quot;(4)<br>
<u>Jane</u>(<i>with one eyebrow cocked</i>): &quot;Yeah. Too bad
you never joined me in my controversial petty teenage vandalism
and arson excursions.&quot;<br>
<br>
(The conversation is interrupted by some music from downstairs.
It's Mystik Spiral, but they're not doing a Mystik Spiral song.)<br>
<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;Speaking of which, would you care to go
downstairs?&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Why not. There's nothing better to do.&quot;<br>
(Both leave the room)<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p>Scene Six:<br>
(The Lane Basement)<br>
Not merely a rehearsal, but a recording this time.<br>
<br>
<u>Trent</u>(<i>singing</i>): &quot;You always brag about how
you're a product of the We Generation.<br>
Don't try to fool me, you're an overhyped version of the 'Me'
Generation.<br>
You claim you stopped the war, but you just let the victims die<br>
You turned away from integration, at South Boston High. <br>
And this was after you bragged, about integrating Little Rock, <br>
When you were too young to do anything.&quot; <br>
<br>
(Music ends here, as Fishplant turns the tape recorder off and
claps slowly.)<br>
<br>
<u>Fishplant:</u> &quot;Cool climax. Now move over.&quot;<br>
<br>
(Daria and Jane arrive in the basement, as Mystik Spiral moves
away from the microphones and The Golden Drying Board takes their
place)<br>
<br>
<u>Trent:</u> &quot;What kind of Spiral tune are you going to do
next?&quot;<br>
<u>Mr. Winston Boy:</u> &quot;Fishplant hasn't told us.&quot;<br>
<u>Jesse:</u> &quot;You're still deciding?&quot;<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;How about 'Icebox Woman?' Did you do that
yet?&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Better than another lame cover of 'Baby I
love Your Way'.&quot;<br>
<u>Trent:</u> &quot;Oh. Hey, Janey. Hey Daria.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria &amp; Jane:</u> &quot;Hey.&quot;<br>
<u>Trent:</u> &quot;I don't see why you can't give that a
shot.&quot;<br>
(Golden Drying Board members mutter to each other in lapsed
agreement)<br>
<u>Fishplant:</u> &quot;Okay, but you've got to do 'Rocket Show'
next.&quot;<br>
<u>Jesse:</u> &quot;How did you come up with that song?&quot;<br>
<u>Fishplant:</u> &quot;Neally O'Healey was a Navy brat. When he
was a kid and his Dad was stationed in Florida and The Bahamas,
he used to watch rocket launches from Cape Canaveral, ranging
from Space Shuttle launches to ordinary unmanned rockets.&quot; <br>
<u>Neally O'Healey:</u> &quot;Some of which the government didn't
want people knowing too much about.&quot;<u><br>
Daria:</u> &quot;Laser-guided anti-missile satellites,
perhaps?&quot; <br>
<u>Neally O'Healey:</u> &quot;Could've been. Most of the time <i>I</i>
didn't even know what was being sent up.&quot;<br>
<u>Fishplant:</u> &quot;Switch on the mic, Trent.&quot; (he does
so) &quot;Icebox Woman, take one.&quot;(Fishplant snaps his
fingers)<br>
<br>
(Upbeat ska music begins)<br>
<u>Fishplant:</u> &quot;Giddyupgiddyupgiddyup.&quot;<br>
(music continues)<br>
<u>Fishplant</u>(<i>singing</i>): &quot;You an angel in black,<br>
you sure have a knack, <br>
for putting my heart on the shelf in de back, <br>
I'm waiting my turn, oh, when will I learn? <br>
My poor heart, you give it freezer burn... <br>
Awww, Yeah...&quot; <br>
<br>
(Music stops abruptly. Mystik Spiral, Golden Drying Board, Daria
&amp; Jane look at each other awkwardly)<br>
<br>
<u>Trent:</u> &quot;Hmm. Are you sure 'Icebox Woman' works as a
ska or reggae song?&quot;<br>
<u>Fishplant:</u> &quot;You're right that didn't turn out so
good.(bands mutter in agreement) What do you say we slow it down
and skank it up a bit?&quot;<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p>Scene Seven:<br>
(The Morgendorffer dinner table)<br>
A rare scene -- Daria and Quinn are sitting down at the table
reading their usual tastes in literature, Jake is cooking up one
of his weird meals, with Lasagna on the side incase it fails, and
Helen actually has some time to relax! So she uses it to bring
&quot;communication&quot; to the table, all the while scheming to
work Daria's recent mild trouble at school into the conversation.<br>
<br>
<u>Helen:</u> &quot;Since I actually have some free time tonight,
I thought I'd use it by finding out if anything interesting
happened at work or school today.&quot;<br>
<u>Quinn:</u> &quot;Well, there's this new kid at school. I think
he's a senior. But anyway, he's always getting in trouble,
telling off teachers, giving everyone obscene gestures, and
things like that. He makes a total spectacle of himself.&quot; <br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;As opposed to making a spectacle of yourself
by trying to look like some of the models in 'Waif'
magazine.&quot;<br>
<u>Helen:</u> &quot;Daria, do you know anything about this new
boy?&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Well, since he pisses off the teachers, he
can't be <i>all</i> bad.&quot;<br>
<u>Helen:</u> &quot;That should be no surprise, coming from a
girl who received detention in school today.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;I take it you got the obligatory call from
school. If you did, then you also know I was able to convince her
of my innocence, so she let me go.&quot;<br>
<u>Helen:</u> &quot;I'm glad, but I still think it's incredible
that a smart girl who enjoys being alone like you tends to fall
in with such a disrespectful crowd.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;I think it's incredible how the generation
that's been bragging for years about how it defied authority is
now claiming it had respect for it.&quot;<br>
(Helen cocks an eyebrow at Daria.)<br>
<u>Jake:</u> &quot;Who here wants to try my New Orleans Duck
L'Orange Surprise?&quot;<br>
<u>Quinn</u>(<i>mortified</i>): &quot;Dah-<i>ad</i>! Ewww!&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Why not invite Corporal Ellenbogen over and
serve it to him? He won't be able to leave the toilet for the
next five days. Then when he's at his most vulnerable moment, <i>Pow</i>.&quot;
(All giving Daria a dirty look) &quot;Hey, I'm just trying to
help.&quot;<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p>Scene Eight:<br>
[Song: &quot;I Hated School,&quot; by The Wretched Ones.]<br>
(The next day, Lawndale High)<br>
A montage of scenes without dialogue where Harry is in class
getting in trouble with teachers. Mrs. Barch is obviously adding
her own anti-male bias in her lessons, he tells her off, gets
cheers from the kids, and is kicked out of class. Coach Gibson
runs him and others around Lawndale High stadium, no problem
until he forces Harry to play football. He knows he can't and so
do the players. He leaves before he gets hurt as the LHS football
team laughs at him. Gibson sends him off the field. Mr. DeMartino
is giving a lesson in his usual way. Harry is listening, but
doesn't believe him and tries to contradict him. He kicks Harry
out of class and most of the kids cheer, with the exception of
Daria and Jodie who are no longer impressed, and Jane who's less
enthusiastic by his defiance than the rest of the class.<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p>Scene Nine:<br>
(Lawndale High, Ms. Li's office)<br>
<br>
<u>Ms. Li:</u> &quot;Three pinkslips from three teachers in less
than half a day? I've never had a new kid with such a bad record.
And all for insubordination.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;That freaky teacher with the bulging eye
looked like he wanted to give me more than just a pinkslip.&quot;<br>
<u>Ms. Li:</u> &quot;Mr. DeMartino's condition is nothing for you
to make fun of.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Mmm, yeah. At first I felt sorry for the guy,
and I tried to look past the thing. But after a while I felt it
gave him no reason to be such an arrogant liar. So he just ticked
me off, and I told him where to stick it.&quot;<br>
<u>Ms. Li:</u> &quot;Well in any case, it says in your permanent
record, that you've got a long history of getting into fights
with teachers, as well as other kids.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Hey, <i>they</i> attacked <i>me</i>. I just
defended myself.&quot;<br>
<u>Ms. Li:</u> &quot;Over 100 times?&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Yeah, it happens a lot. People want to give
me a hard time, and I have no other choice. And don't give me
that crap about walking away and telling the teacher, because
when a kid wants to start a fight with you, they're not going to
let you do that. Besides, some of the people had to fight off <i>were</i>
teachers, including one who tried to use a first grader as his
girlfriend, if you know what I mean.&quot;<br>
<u>Ms. Li:</u> &quot;I see. And how do we know you won't try to
start any fights with the faculty here?&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Nobody does anything to me, I won't do
anything to them.&quot;<br>
<u>Ms. Li:</u> &quot;What about threatening to kill Mrs. Barch?
We've got a zero-tolerance policy on that kind of thing
here.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;No, all I said was that I was gonna make her
pay. I didn't say I was gonna kill her. Murder is <i>not</i> the
only form of revenge, y'know. And I wouldn't do it over some
trumped-up misconduct charge.&quot;<br>
<u>Ms. Li:</u> &quot;Okay, then perhaps you'd care to disclose
what kind of revenge you're planning for Ms. Barch, so I can
believe you?&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Well, I wouldn't tell <i>you</i>. You'd try
to stop me.&quot;<br>
<u>Ms. Li:</u> &quot;But how can we be sure it's not going to be
violent? Crime in school is on the rampage these days and we have
to take precautions.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Did you ever consider that all these drastic
precautions that you school staff members take may actually <i>cause</i>
some kids to become violent?&quot;<br>
<u>Ms. Li:</u> &quot;A school has to have rules to prevent
anarchy. We can't allow students to get into fights even in
self-defense. Only when we have order and discipline and students
learn to fulfill their subservient roles, can we have a fully
productive educational system, and bring honor and pride unto
Laaaawndale High. <b><i>Nothing</i></b> must be done that
threatens that honor!&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Oh, I get it. Just like every other school
I've been in. The same old party line. Never mind reality. The
teachers are always to be obeyed. (grabs the desk and lunges
forward) I don't think so!!&quot;<br>
<u>Ms. Li:</u> &quot;Son, if you think your permanent record is
marred now, just wait till <i>I</i> get a hold of it. If you
don't wind up in prison before you graduate, I have ties with
some friends at the psychiatric ward at Cedars of Lawndale, and I
can always add you to their watch list. Step out of line under my
watch and I can have you committed as a basket case. And I can
be...<i>very</i> persuasive.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Yeah, well as intimidating as you can be, all
you'll ever accomplish with that threat is to piss me off a lot
more!! As far as I'm concerned, <b><i>bitch</i></b>, I will <b><i>never</i></b>
see you as <i>anything else</i>, but <b><i>The Enemy!!</i></b>&quot;<br>
(Harry walks away briefly, while Ms. Li's expression goes from
slight terror to cold disdain. Then with more anger he turns
around to Ms. Li)<br>
<u>Harry</u>(<i>directly in Ms. Li's face</i>): &quot;<b><i>EN-E-MYYYYY!!!!!</i></b>&quot;<br>
[Song: &quot;I Hated School,&quot; by The Wretched Ones.]<br>
(Ms. Li is terrified as Harry walks out of the office, randomly
trashing school property. We now see Harry with his back turned
to the viewer, walking through the halls, continuing his rampage
of destruction. He kicks lockers, garbage pails, tears down
posters, plaques, and an entire shelf of athletic trophies!! This
guy makes Judd Nelson in &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; look like
the head of the boy's jamboree.).<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p>Scene Ten:<br>
(Daria &amp; Jane's bedrooms, on their respected telephones.
Therefore, a split-screen is necessary.)<br>
<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;...and he just started stomping through the
halls trashing anything he could get his hands on. He tore the
trophy shelf right off the wall, like it was a mere picture
frame.&quot;<br>
<u>Jane</u>(<i>shocked</i>): &quot;That skinny kid tore a huge
shelf like that off the wall?! Wow, he must be pretty strong! He
should've waited until <i>after</i> school to go on his rampage,
though.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;And here we were thinking he was cool because
he easily told off our teachers.&quot;<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;Most of the football team can't even do that.
Kevin certainly can't.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;It's scary that you know that about
him.&quot;<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;Yeah, well I <i>was</i> in Lawndale before
you.&quot; <br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;You have my pity.&quot;<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;So anyway, why did Ms. Li call <i>you</i> to
the office this time?&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;They want me to tutor him after school when
his suspension is over, and bring him his homework assignment. I
don't like this, Jane. The guy's got a temper shorter than my
father's attention span.&quot;<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;Bummer. Do you think Tom will be able to
protect you from him by himself if you tick the kid off?&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;I hope so. Between Tom, Harry and my secret
admirer 'Dick,' I don't know how I'm going to juggle so many
boys. I might even consider asking Quinn for tips.&quot; <br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;Woah. Don't to anything <i>that</i> drastic.
Besides, I still think he's cute. It's times like this I wish I
was as smart as you so I could get a boy like him to do some
'studying' over at my house.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;With the number of times you've dragged me
down to the basement lately, I thought you'd be ready to fall for
that band playing with Trent.&quot;<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;Well if Harry's not available...Uh-oh. I just
thought of something.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;What.&quot;<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;This may be just a hunch, but now I'm starting
to wonder if your secret admirer might be a member of the Golden
Drying Board.&quot;<br>

Scene Eleven/Act Two:<br>
[Song: &quot;Uncontrollable Urge,&quot; by SNFU.].<br>
(Lawndale High, Mr. O'Neill's Class)<br>
<br>
<u>Mr. O'Neill:</u> &quot;Okay, class. Does anybody have that
reading assignment where we interpret established written
material in different ways? How about you first, Harry?&quot;<br>
(Harry stands up, without objections this time)<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Okay. My assignment is a reading of the liner
notes to the 1997 compilation CD, 'We Are Not Devo'.&quot;<br>
<u>Mr. O'Neill:</u> &quot;Um, Harry, you really should've chosen
a <i>book</i> to read.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;You said to do an interpretation of <i>anything</i>
we wanted to read, didn't you?&quot;<br>
<u>Mr. O'Neill</u>(<i>chuckling nervously</i>): &quot;Yes
I&#133;see your point. Go on, Harry.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry</u>(<i>clearing his throat, and doing his best
'gee-whiz' voice</i>): &quot;Way back in 1977 when I was 13, my
best buddy Timmy and I were looking for some neat-o kind of music
that nobody ever heard before. We heard all kinds of stories
about 'punk' and 'new-wave,' and all the stories we heard about
it were mean. But we wanted to find out what it was like for
ourselves.&quot;<br>
(Giggles form the class). &quot;We bought two of those new
records form our local record store; 1)'Never Mind the Bollocks,
Here's the Sex Pistols,' and 2)'Question: Are We Not Men? Answer:
We are Devo.'(more giggles) &quot;The first one we listened to
was the Sex Pistols one, and we didn't like it one bit. It was
scary.&quot; (giggling resumes briefly) &quot;I guess we weren't
used to such daring kinds of music, so we broke it up into little
pieces and threw it in the garbage pale. Then we listened to the
Devo album, and heard the song 'Uncontrollable Urge.' It didn't
seem so bad; in fact, it was a lot of fun. We both started
pogoing and bumping and dancing around through the whole album.
It was O-Kay! More than that, it was peachy-keen!&quot;<br>
(giggling resumes again) &quot;Now it's twenty years later, and I
loved it so much, I decided to put an album of all the bands at
my own record company doing their own versions of Devo songs. And
so many of the bands like Devo as much as I do, that we had to
hold the door to the recording studio. In fact, some of them say
that Devo made them want to be in a band when they grew up. And
if making this album wasn't enough fun already, in the process of
doing it, we actually got to meet some former members of the
band! Oh, boy!&quot;<br>
(giggling and snickering almost goes over the edge) <br>
&quot;By the way, as I grew up, I learned to think The Sex
Pistols were okay anyway.&quot;(back to his normal voice)
&quot;Thank you.&quot; <br>
<br>
<u>Mr. O'Neill:</u> &quot;Interesting. May I see that C.D. for a
minute?&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;The last time a teacher asked me that, I lost
a valuable comic book. No way, teach!&quot;<br>
<u>Mr. O'Neill:</u> &quot;No, I'm not confiscating it.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Yeah, well if you want to tape it, you'd
better bring it back!&quot;<br>
(Daria talks to him from her desk)<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;It's okay, kid. You <i>can</i> trust the
guy.&quot;<br>
<u>Jane</u>(<i>feigning motherly surprise</i>): &quot;Young lady,
I expect much more from you than to tell that boy such
fibs.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;I trust him not to steal our personal
possessions as a form of punishment, but that's about it.&quot;<br>
<br>
(Mr. O'Neill examines the liner notes, mumbling to himself, his
mood changes form curious, to disturbed, to pleased.).<br>
<br>
<u>Mr. O'Neill:</u> &quot;Well, I'd say you've described these
liner notes in a unique manner, and judging by the laughter of
the rest of the class, it appears you've given them some
interest. But since the assignment focused primarily on
contemporary literature, or at least theater scripts, I'm afraid
I'll only have to give you a C-plus.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry</u>(<i>disgruntled, but still satisfied</i>) &quot;Gee,
thanks. My last school would've given me an F-minus and a
reprimand. At least <i>you</i> appreciate creativity.&quot;<br>
(Bell rings. Class begins leaving)<br>
<u>Mr. O'Neill:</u> &quot;Ooh, Daria, Harry. Can I see you two
after class, please?&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry looks befuddled. Daria looks concerned.<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p>Scene Twelve:<br>
(Outside of Lawndale High, right after school.) <br>
Daria is walking out of school with Harry, explaining her routine
of tutoring.<br>
<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Okay. I don't know what topics you're having
trouble with, besides making friends with teachers, but since I
don't make friends with them either, you're probably lucky you've
got me as a tutor.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;I don't know why, but that kind of makes me
feel somewhat secure.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Good. So then we understand each other.&quot;<br>
<u>Jane</u>(<i>in the distance</i>): &quot;Yo, Daria. Wait
up.&quot;<br>
(Jane jogs towards Daria &amp; Harry)<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Do you two know each other?&quot; <br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;I always walk with her to and from school.
Today we were planning to stop over at my place first.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;I hope you don't mind a brief personal
diversion before your tutoring?&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Sounds okay to me.&quot; <br>
<br>
(The three walk out of view)<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p>Scene Thirteen:<br>
(The Lane Basement)<br>
Another recording with the two bands.<br>
<br>
<u>Trent</u>(<i>singing</i>): &quot;..The only thing you teach
'em is that might makes right,<br>
and power is mean.<br>
If you were my dad, I would've shot you dead, before I turned
thirteen.&quot;<br>
(song ends with feedback)<br>
<u>Fishplant:</u> &quot;Alright, man. Reminds me of your old Bats
With Guns song 'PTA, Against the Children'.&quot;<br>
<u>Jesse:</u> &quot;Thanks. That's a Harpies song now, so we had
to do this.&quot;<br>
<u>Fishplant:</u> &quot;But y'know what song I like that you did?
'Little Runaway'.&quot;<br>
<u>Trent:</u> &quot;Oh yeah. We wanted to record that song live,
originally. But we had to chuck those plans.&quot; <br>
<u>Q.T.:</u> &quot;Couldn't get permission from the club, or just
no way of getting the proper recording equipment backstage?&quot;<br>
<u>Trent:</u> &quot;Nawww. Some punks trashed The Zen in the
middle of a performance.&quot;(6)<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;And I can safely say my brother isn't using
some lame excuse this time. I was there, and I've got the hand
prints on my ass to prove it.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Which just goes to show that the more I hear
about that incident, the less I want to know.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot; 'PTA Against the Children,' huh? Well I've
never heard the song, but I think I like the idea behind it. You
should ask them if you can do a cover of it?&quot; <br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;Hey we found something the kid likes after
all. Imagine that.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Yeah, this ain't so bad.&quot; <br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Well, perhaps you'd like to enjoy the
rehearsal, while Jane and I head upstairs for a little private
time.&quot;<br>
<br>
(Daria and Jane leave the basement)<br>
<br>
<u>Fishplant:</u> &quot;Trent, my man. Would you be willing to
introduce this boy to the song he's so curious about, just for
this moment?&quot;<br>
<u>Trent:</u> &quot;Why not? Hit it, Max.&quot;<br>
Max starts off on the drums, and the rest of the band follows
suit, as Harry and The Golden Drying Board observe in amusement.
Scene ends here.<br>

<p>Scene Fourteen:<br>
(The Morgendorffer house, Daria's room)<br>
A television set blares stock &quot;Sick, Sad World&quot; theme
music shows a woman in red primping herself up as if she's going
out on a date, then that same woman trying to flirt with a man,
who's clearly uninterested in her.<br>
<br>
<u>SSW Announcer (male):</u> &quot;Tired of getting all dressed
up for a man, only to have him snub you? Maybe he's gay, right?
Or maybe he just has a different idea about what's
beautiful.&quot;<br>
<u>Male interviewee #1:</u> &quot;I like 'em fat.&quot;<br>
<u>Male interviewee #2:</u> &quot;I tend to be drawn to girls who
wear glasses.&quot; <br>
<u>Male interviewee #3:</u> &quot;I'm only into women who dress
like sixties perky-girls.&quot;<br>
<u>Overacting middle-aged Woman:</u> &quot;Sonny-Boy. Please
settle down, before it's too late.&quot;<br>
<u>SSW Announcer (male):</u> &quot;From chubby-chasers to
geek-gawkers, and everything in between, it's picky bachelor sons
with odd preferences, and the mother's who worry about them.
Tomorrow on 'Sick, Sad World.' &quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Damn. I missed today's episode.&quot; <br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;You wanted to see the previous episode? What
was it?&quot;<br>
<u>Daria</u>(<i>turning off TV</i>): &quot;Aliens who help
sub-standard college students cheat on their exams.&quot; <br>
<u>Harry</u>(<i>smirking</i>): &quot;As long as they're 'sexy'
aliens it's fine with me.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;O-kay. Getting back to why we're here, I
guess the first thing I have to do is see which subjects you're
having trouble with. And as part of your tutoring I've been given
a segment of your permanent record. Unfortunately, it's strictly
academic, therefore it doesn't contain any material that you can
use as an attempt to sue the school system for slander.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;The sum of the square roots of any two sides
of an right triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining
side.&quot; <br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Hmm... 'No trouble with math,' but you
could've got that from 'The Wizard of Oz.' Moving on to
literature. I want you to check off all the books you've read.
(hands Harry a list) No point in assigning <u>Brave New World</u>
or <u>The Catcher in the Rye</u> again, unless it's for personal
enjoyment.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;I'm aware of the cultural references to them.
Some people even think I've patterned myself after Holden
Caulfield, but I assure you they're lying.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;I see. And I believe you. But just to be
sure, I'll add this to your reading list. Now about your sense of
history--if your comments in Mr. DeMartino's class are any
indication, you probably don't need as much help as your records
say you do. They do say that you have some trouble in
geography.&quot; <br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Really? Pick a country to talk about.&quot; <br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Armenia.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Okay, Present day Armenia was created by the
former Soviet Union, along with neighboring Azerbaijan which has
territorial disputes created at the end of World War One. When
the Ottoman Turks and Triple Alliance fell, there was a failed
proposal to establish a League of Nations Mandate that would've
made a greater Armenia in what is now part of northeastern
Turkey, and existing Armenia that was controlled by the United
States&#133;along with a joint U.S./U.K. occupation of the
Turkish Black Sea coast and the renaming of Istanbul as
Constantinople. This effort failed largely due to isolationism in
the U.S., and the USSR's continuation of the expansionist
policies of the Czars they overthrew in 1917.<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Wait a minute - Nobody taking remedial
geography knows this. Nobody taking remedial <i>anything</i>
knows this. So how do <i>you</i> know it?&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Mostly, I read this stuff by myself. And if I
have any other questions or further interest, I always try to
find out more from another source.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Wow. It's incredible that you get into so
much trouble in school, and yet you know about subjects that most
troubled students wouldn't even be able to guess on.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Hey, what can I say? I find so little in
school to believe, and so much to be disgusted by, that I just
have to speak out.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;I've <i>always</i> found it hard to believe
the school's criteria.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Y'know, Daria, you're kind of cute.&quot;
(Daria looks at him with surprise and displeasure) &quot;And
you're seeing somebody (beat), or you're just not interested in
me. I knew it.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Somehow I get the impression that your bad
grades and disruptive behavior are just an unorthodox way to pick
up girls.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Hey, it was the school's idea to send me a
tutor, not mine. They could've sent me some chubby pimple-faced
kid from the chess club, who's a Trekkie on the side for all I
knew. (beat) This school <i>does</i> have a chess club, doesn't
it.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Surprisingly, yes. But what makes you think <i>you</i>
could be a member?&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;I didn't say I wanted to join it. I just
wanted to get an idea about the priorities of this school.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria</u>(<i>sighing</i>): &quot;You're right. I had no reason
to snap at you. It's just that you've got to learn that you can't
just go around asking complete strangers out on a date.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Well, if we didn't ask total strangers, we
might as well marry our relatives.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;You <i>could</i> use dating services, but
they require that you're over 21, relatively wealthy and open to
the possibility of scams from services and clients alike.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Okay, then how <i>else</i> do we find
potential mates?&quot;<br>

(Daria's room, continuing from previous scene)<br>
<br>
<u>Tom:</u> &quot;Hey, Daria. Who's this?&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Oh, Tom Sloane, meet Harry Whitford, tutoring
job. He doesn't <i>need</i> tutoring as much, but Lawndale High
stuck me with him because he was such a 'difficult'
student.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;So this is your boyfriend. (to Tom) Man, am I
jealous of you.&quot;<br>
<u>Tom:</u> &quot;And you'd have every reason to be. She's quite
a catch, she funny, she's smart, and dare I say it she's
cute.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;I agree. She <i>is</i> quite a fox. She
deserves someone good.&quot;<br>
<u>Tom</u>(<i>With one eyebrow raised</i>): &quot;So are you
saying you want to fight over her?&quot; <br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Why bother? She's already happy with you, and
not interested in me. Besides, I'm above all that crap.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;God, you two are making me feel like Quinn
with her fan club.&quot;<br>
(Runs out of the room. Harry feels embarrassed over this
encounter.).<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Aww, dammit. Every time I meet a girl I like,
I always end up doing things like this. I've gotta go. Tell Daria
I apologize for making her feel so awkward.&quot;<br>

<p>Scene Sixteen:<br>
(Jane's House, Front Door)<br>
Jane walks to the door to see who's knocking on it. She opens it
to find Daria. <br>
<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;If Harry is looking for me, I'm not here
(beat) or anyone else, for that matter. Tom, maybe. But only if
he's alone.&quot;<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;What did he try to do to you? Get you to read
The Poor Man's James Bond? (7) Anyway, what did he say about
me?&quot; <br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;It's not <i>you</i> he's interested in. Trust
me.&quot; <br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;Damn. So, if it's not me, and it's not an
automatic weapon...it's Quinn, isn't it?&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;No. I wouldn't even wish that on her.&quot;<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;Well, did he pass of fail?&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;It's incomplete. But the guy's actually
pretty smart. He probably wouldn't do so badly in school, if he
didn't spend so much time trying to demolish it. So I may give
him a vague passing grade, just to be on the safe side.&quot;<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;Too bad he didn't get transferred to a school
that deserves to be demolished more than ours.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;So how's the duet with the Golden Drying
Board coming?&quot;<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;Not so good. There's a big argument between
them on the musical influences of some of the greats. Everybody's
making a big fuss over white influences, black influences, who
stole from who, which bands are more derivative than the other.
They're spending so much time arguing, they forgot they were
supposed to cut an album together.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria</u>(<i>with an &quot;I knew it&quot; look on her face</i>):
&quot;Mmm-hmm.&quot;<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;Perhaps we'd better stop them.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Better than hanging around here.&quot; <br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p>Scene Seventeen:<br>
[Song: &quot;CD Repo Man,&quot; by The Aquabats.]<br>
(The Lane Basement)<br>
The middle of that argument Jane mentioned.<br>
<br>
<u>Trent:</u> &quot;All I'm saying is that people like Jerry Lee
Lewis and Elvis played this music because <i>they</i> liked it.
They were color-blind and they knew some of their potential fans
would be too. Jerry Lee Lewis got in trouble for playing
boogie-woogie music in a southern church. Elvis used to go to
black churches because he liked the way that people sang there.
He would've got a thrill out of rap when it first came out.&quot;
<br>
<u>Fishplant:</u> &quot;You expect us to believe a fat old
southern man like Elvis Presley would change into a rap
musician?&quot; <br>
<u>Nick:</u> &quot;Yeah, right. Elvis the rapper? I don't think
so.&quot;<br>
<u>Trent:</u> &quot;I'm not saying he would've <i>tried</i> rap.
I'm saying he would've had an appreciation for it. Maybe he
would've hired a rapper to sing back up on one of his songs, like
Rush did in 'Roll the Bones'.&quot; <br>
<u>Max:</u> &quot;Elvis and KRS One?&quot;<br>
<u>Q.T.:</u> &quot;Hey, the king <i>did</i> see a Ramones concert
in 1975, so he had a broad musical appreciation, even if his own
music wasn't exactly as hard as theirs in the 70's. If we were
doing music like this before, nobody noticed, until Elvis, Buddy
Holly, and Little Richard brought it out to the rest of the
world.&quot;<br>
<u>Fishplant:</u> &quot;I guess you've got a point, Trent.&quot;<br>
<u>Jesse:</u> &quot;Right. If anything, Jimi Hendrix is the
musical thief. <i>He</i> stole his musical influence from white
people.&quot;<br>
<u>Trent:</u> &quot;No that's wrong too. He's got a lot of blues
in his music. And the blues is hardly considered white
music.&quot;<br>
<u>Fishplant:</u> &quot;Yeah, well at least it ain't like all
that southern rock. Nothing's as white as that confederate
flag-waving, redneck crap.&quot;<br>
<u>Trent:</u> &quot;No, that's black music too. Heavy blues
influence in there, if you pay close attention.&quot;<br>
<u>Jesse:</u> &quot;Wow, you're right. I never thought of
that.&quot;<br>
<u>Nick</u>(<i>to Jesse</i>): &quot;Hey, man. Are you losing your
mind? I mean you're not actually <i>buying</i> what Trent is
telling us, are you?&quot; <br>
<u>Trent:</u> &quot;Why do you think bikers can listen both to
metal and southern rock?&quot;<br>
<u>Sax-O-Geranium:</u> &quot;Because they're both whitebread
music thieves, that's why.&quot; <br>
<u>Q.T.:</u> &quot;Didn't you hear what Trent said, Sax-O?&quot; <br>
<u>Max:</u> &quot;Oh yeah? If he's right, then how come I see so
few black rock musicians?&quot; <br>
<u>Nick:</u> &quot;Yeah?&quot;<br>
<u>Q.T.:</u> &quot;Because you people don't know where to
look.&quot;<br>
(<em>Max begins struggling for an adequate reply</em>)<u><br>
Max:</u> &quot;Yeah well, it shouldn't be about black or white
anyway. It's about the music.&quot;<br>
<br>
(Incoherent and heated arguing breaks out within both bands. Then
The Golden Drying Board look at Mystik Spiral with discontent.)<br>
<br>
<u>Fishplant:</u> &quot;Look, man. You may be right and all, but
we're getting a lot of bad vibes in here. So we're just going to
take a break until they fade out.&quot; <br>
<br>
(The Golden Drying Board walks out. Max and Nick look at Trent
and Jesse in disgust as Jesse shrugs his shoulders.)<br>
<br>
<u>Max:</u> &quot;Thanks for killing our big break, Trent.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jane and Daria walk in, as Mystik Spiral sans Trent walk out.
Jane looks deeply concerned, and disheartened. She does not like
the way the situation is for the bands and since she only hears
Max ranting about it, suspects it's her brother's fault.<br>
<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;Trent, if you have any work-ethic applied to
your music, <i>please</i> tell me this walkout is
temporary.&quot;<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p>Scene Eighteen:<br>
(Daria's Bedroom, nighttime)<br>
Daria dreams of all the guys she ever had some interest in, or
had an interest in her; Tom Trent, Ted, Luhrman, Upchuck, Guy,
and now Harry. (8) Daria walks through some vast wasteland of
dead trees spread far apart, then she's on a &quot;tunnel of
love-type&quot; float with Tom, somewhat secure. That security is
shattered when Trent uncharacteristically tries to grab her arm
and fight with Tom over her, each grabbing one arm, pulling her
back and forth like in an old Popeye cartoon. Suddenly, Ted
DeWitt-Clinton approaches her with a homemade radioactive
necklace as a gift. <br>
<br>
<u>Ted:</u> &quot;Here, Daria. I made this for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
She tries to back away, but only succeeds when Tom &amp; Trent
tackle him. Daria flees all three of them, and runs into an
alleyway that leads to a door, which is her only escape.
Stenciled on this door in white paint and full capital letters
are the words &quot;YOUR ONLY ESCAPE.&quot; She opens the door
and goes in, when suddenly she feels the urge to dance.
Spotlights suddenly appear above her. Now she's in a slinky
costume, on a lighted runway, in a strip joint. One patron sits
in the stands in his usual mellow fashion---Luhrman!<br>
<br>
<u>Luhrman</u>(<i>in his usual tone</i>): &quot;Take it off. Take
it <i>all</i> off.&quot; (9)<br>
<br>
Daria finally returns backstage, only to realize she's caught in
a quicksand trap. In the distance, she sees a big bird that could
swoop down and rescue her. Once the bird gets closer, she
realizes it's a buzzard and it has Upchuck's head!!<br>
<br>
<u>Upchuck-Buzzard:</u> &quot;Fear not, my sweets. Your prince
charming is here to rescue you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Daria dives down in order to avoid the Upchuck-bird, when
suddenly she's hanging on a ledge surrounded by psychedelic
colors, with Upchuck &amp; Harry hanging on her ankles, trying to
pull her down. The ledge turns to liquid and so does she, as one
leg falls faster than the other, in two separate directions.
You'd think it was over, but no such luck. She hits the ground in
one piece, alive and uninjured, but flat on her rear end. She now
realizes she's caught in a trace (10) that's approximately 12
feet deep. Daria runs through the trace. Flashes of the heads of
the boys in her dreams appear briefly on each side of her. The
whole scene is totally surreal like something out of a Sally
Cruikshank(11) cartoon.<br>
<br>
<u>Tom's head:</u> &quot;Daria, you're so darn pleasant and
friendly, I don't see how anyone <i>could</i> resist an evening
with you.&quot;<br>
<u>Trent's head:</u> &quot;You're the coolest high schooler I
know. &quot;<br>
<u>Upchuck's head:</u> &quot;Rrrrr. Feisty.&quot; <br>
<u>Ted's head:</u> &quot;<i>You're</i> the remarkable one. I
mean, please don't take this wrong, but you've got it all.&quot; <br>
<u>Harry's head:</u> &quot;Y'know, Daria, you're kind of
cute.&quot;<br>
<u>Luhrman's head:</u> &quot;Just a little pointless chit-chat.
Would you like another soda?&quot;<br>
<u>Trent's head:</u> &quot;Too bad you're still in high school. I
could ask <i>you</i> out. &quot;<br>
A yellow car pulls up in front of her and the front door opens.<br>
<u>Guy</u>(<i>smiling</i>): &quot;Hey, Daria. Quinn told me you
needed a ride home from the library.&quot;<br>
<br>
Daria flees. She runs along the road and Guy follows her. She
sees the Morgendorffer residence in the distance. Just when she
finally thinks she's safe at home, Jake and Helen open the door
to meet him.<br>
<br>
<u>Jake</u>(<i>trying to impress him</i>): &quot;Hey, Guy.
Whassuuuup?&quot;<br>
<u>Helen</u>(<i>lecturing</i>): &quot;Daria, you should've <i>known</i>
that you were going to face this kind of thing someday.&quot;<br>
<br>
Guy stretches his arm beyond all possible lengths out the
passenger side window and with his ridiculously enlarged hand,
grabs Daria by the torso, pulling her in his car as she screams
for dear life.<br>
<br>
[Song; &quot;Giant,&quot; by Throwing Muses.].<br>
The dream ends, and Daria wakes up in her usual state of terror,
as shown in episodes such as &quot;Monster&quot;(#206),
&quot;Ill&quot;(209), and &quot;Through a Lens
Darkly&quot;(#301). Though it's only 4:45 in the morning, she
goes to the bathroom to look in the mirror, and see if there are
any spots in her eyes, or anything else resembling illness. She
sees none, and returns to her bedroom.<br>

<p>Scene Nineteen:<br>
(Shot of Lawndale High School, then Mr. DeMartino's class)<br>
<br>
<u>Mr. DeMartino:</u> &quot;And like such fanatics in the Middle
East as the <i>Hezbol</i><b><i>lah</i></b><i>, Hamas</i> and the
so-called <i>'Demo</i><b><i>cratic</i></b><i> Front'</i> for the
Liberation of <b><i>Pal</i></b><i>estine</i>, Catholics and
Protestants in Northern Ireland wage a <i>meaningless</i> holy
war, for no other purpose than to cause chaos and despair, using <i>shallow
tra</i><b><i>dit</i></b><i>ions</i> to justify their
bloodbaths.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Oh, come ON!&quot;<br>
<u>Mr. DeMartino:</u> &quot;I <i>hope</i> you're not about to
accuse me of being a <i>liar</i> again Mr. Whitford. (building to
hysteria) Because if you <b><i>are</i></b><i>, then you'd better
have some </i><b><i>decent evidence to support your perspective!!</i></b>&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Fine: The troubles in Northern Ireland have
always been about national sovereignty versus colonial
domination. London simply plays upon the old religious
differences between Catholics and Protestants in order to
discredit the I.R.A.'s cause. Protestants who prefer Irish unity
and independence are often referred to as 'rotten prods.' The
Orange Order <i>still</i> gets away with hassling Catholics for
stopping them from marching through Catholic neighborhoods,
bragging about some old holy war they won back in 1690. They've
been doing it <i>long</i> before the Revolution of 1916, and they
haven't stopped. Even the modern media focuses on the religious
aspects of the war, while the issue of colonial rule is put on
the back burner.&quot;<br>
<u>Mr. DeMartino</u>(<i>sarcastic</i>): &quot;Ooh! And <b><i>why</i></b>
do you think they'd want to do <b><i>this?!</i></b>&quot; <br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Well aside from the risk of losing some
territory on the other side of the Irish Sea, they sought to
sabotage the proposed Irish Republic's attempts to succeed as an
industrialized nation. So they rigged the occupation of six of
the nine counties of Ulster, changed the name of the dreaded
Royal Irish Constabulary, a.k.a. 'The Black-and-Tans,' to the
Royal <i>Ulster</i> Constabulary, and despite the failure of
thwarting a republic they've managed to permanently keep Ireland
divided both geographically, and spiritually.&quot;<br>
<u>Mr. DeMartino:</u> &quot;<i>Really?</i> Any <i>other</i>
examples of these kind of shenanigans by the British
Empire?&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Sure. When India fought to breakaway from the
British Empire, their people were divided by religion too. In
their case it was Muslims and Hindus. So before Ghandi was
assassinated in his attempt to negotiate some sort of peace
between them, London partitioned India by creating the Muslim
nations of West Pakistan and East Pakistan, which in 1971
separated from West Pakistan and became Bangladesh. <br>
<u>Mr. DeMartino:</u> &quot;Whoa!! <i>Wait one </i><b><i>min</i></b><i>ute!!</i>
Are you suggesting that you believe the assassination of Mahatma
Ghandi was part of some con<b><i>spir</i></b>acy on behalf of <b><i>British
Secret Security?!!</i></b>&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Nahhh. It was his own people who bumped him
off. But you've got to admit, the U.K certainly benefited form
the man's death.&quot;<br>
<u>Mr. DeMartino:</u> &quot;Hmm. A very <b><i>interesting</i></b>
perspective. (bell rings) <b><i>See me after class!!</i></b>&quot;<br>

<p>Scene Twenty:<br>
(Lawndale High, Daria's locker)<br>
Daria opens her locker and finds yet another bouquet of flowers
with a note next to it.<br>
<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Oh no. Not again.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;That was old. You can throw it away, or give
it back and I'll use the seeds to replant it.&quot; <br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;So <i>you're</i> the one who's been following
me.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Yeah, but I know when to quit.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Then why are you bothering me now?&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;To try to give you the impression that I've
given up on you.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;It's not working.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Sorry. It's all I can do.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Well for future reference, the best way to a
girl's heart is <i>not</i> through picking their lockers, or a
raging spree of endless destruction.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;I didn't think it was. Of course, I do those
things because of what I feel, not who I might impress.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Why did you even bother going into my locker
in the first place?&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Usually, I do this when I want to sabotage
someone else's locker with small explosives, a spring-loaded pie,
or something like that. But when I saw you, it confirmed my gut
feeling that girls like you existed, and seeing no other way to
come on to you, I used whatever skills I had to get through to
you. I should've known you were too good to be true.&quot; <br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Am I supposed to be flattered by that
remark?&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Hey, be what you want, Daria. I'm just
telling the truth about what I did.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Does that mean you might try hitting on me
again someday?&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Not unless, you can set me up with a girl who
looks remotely like you.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Dating is my sister's department. You want to
find somebody to go out with, talk to miss popularity.&quot; <br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Nahh. I've seen her and her friends. They
turn me off.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;I'm surprised. You're just as superficial as
they are.&quot;<br>
<u>Harry:</u> &quot;Yeah, you're right. I just have a different
set of standards that's all. I'm into pale-looking women like
you, not overly made-up wannabe fashion models like her. But at
least we can both go on with our separate lives. See you in
school tomorrow, Daria...or maybe not.&quot;<br>
<br>
(Harry walks away. Daria looks at him quizzically and slightly
bemused. Cut to Jane approaching her.)(12)<br>
<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;So that was your new secret admirer,
huh?&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Not anymore. He already knows I'm not
available. I should've known it was him when the flowers started
appearing in my locker around the same time he came to this
school.&quot;<br>
<u>Jane</u>(<i>sarcastic</i>): &quot;Rats. And I had a $20 bet
going that he was some deranged stalker who was going to take you
hostage, and shout. 'If I can't have you, nobody else
will!!'&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Maybe you should make that confession in your
next Gamblers Anonymous meeting.&quot;<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;I can't. Some of them might have been your
admirers.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;Well unless Tom, Upchuck, Ted DeWitt-Clinton,
and/or Mr. O'Neill were in on this too, I can't imagine who else
those 'admirers' could have been.&quot;<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;Daria, you still amaze me after all the years
I've known you. You do everything you can to keep people away
from you. You don't follow the latest fashions, you never wear
makeup, you don't dance, you avoid all extracurricular
activities, you nail people with wittier observations and insults
than <i>I've</i> ever been able to come up with, and somehow
people of both genders still want to hang out with you.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;What are you trying to tell me?&quot;<br>
<u>Jane</u>(<i>beaming</i>): &quot;Face it, Daria. You're <i>popular</i>.
You're a babe. You're a goddess. You're a <i>sex symbol</i>, for
Pete's sake. <i>Guys</i> actually <b><i>want</i></b><b> you!</b>&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;I should punish you for that remark, but I
can't think of an appropriate way of doing so.&quot;<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;It wouldn't involve losing the right to a walk
home from school with you, would it?&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;No. Besides, it's the only way I can keep you
from crushed by the punk-ska fight.&quot;<br>
(Daria &amp; Jane begin walking down the hall. The light at the
doorway has a &quot;sunset-type&quot; appeal.)<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;Good. I'm getting tired of listening to the
debate between Trent and Max on whether or not Elvis would've
liked rap.&quot;<br>
<u>Daria:</u> &quot;I concur. And more importantly, I like their
sped-up version of 'Heart-Shaped Box,' by Nirvana much
better.&quot;<br>
<u>Jane:</u> &quot;Boy. If only Trent knew this about you two
years ago, he finally would have won your heart.&quot; <br>

<p>THE END </p>

<hr>

<p><br>
<u>Author's Notes:</u> <font size="2" face="Arial">1)Originally,
I wanted to make the subplot involving Trent and Mystik Spiral's
duet with the ska band into a separate fic called &quot;Up the
Down Ska-Chase,&quot; mainly so that I could do some wordplay
with the title to the classic 1960's pop-culture high school book
&quot;Up the Down Staircase.&quot; Having nothing else to go on,
I decided to integrate it into &quot;The Insubordinator. I also
considered naming the band after the title of the defunct fanfic,
along with 'Pirates of Rendezvous Bay,' or some other obscure bay
on Anguilla Island.&quot;<br>
<br>
2)Arthur Bremer is the man who attempted to assassinate Alabama's
controversial former segregationist Governor &amp; Presidential
candidate George Wallace(1919-1998) on May 15, 1972.<br>
<br>
3,6)See my previous fic &quot;The Highland Invasion.&quot;<br>
<br>
4)Re; &quot;Arts 'n' Crass&quot; (ep. #201).<br>
<br>
5)For the actual liner notes, go buy the real C.D., &quot;We Are
Not Devo: A Tribute to Devo. If you're willing to accept a wider
variety of musical styles, you won't be disappointed with a
single cover.<br>
<br>
7)&quot;The Poor Man's James Bond,&quot; is a four-volume book by
ex-white supremacist Paul Saxon. It's a how-to book on making
your own homemade weapons, explosives, and the like, which was
supposed to be used in the event of a takeover of the U.S.
Government by either left-wing, or right-wing extremists, but is
more popular amongst terrorists in the United States and abroad. <br>
<br>
8) I even considered making Beavis and Butt-head two of the guys
in her nightmare, but I promised somebody out there that this fic
would be B &amp; B free. Besides, neither of them felt anything
for her, and neither did she for them.<br>
<br>
9)Re; &quot;I Don't (ep. #204), where Daria told all the other
bride's maids those outrageous stories about herself, including
that she works in a strip club, and Luhrman plays along with her.<br>
<br>
10)A trace, in case you don't know is a trail that's cut deep
into the ground. Examples include the historic Natchez Trace in
Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee.<br>
<br>
11)Sally Cruikshank is the cartoonist responsible for such short
films as &quot;Face Like a Frog,&quot; and &quot;Quasi at the
Quackadero.&quot; Her work can also be seen on occasional
episodes of &quot;Sesame Street,&quot; and other PBS children's
shows.<br>
<br>
12)Believe it or not, I actually considered adding
&quot;Everlong,&quot; by The Foo Fighters in that scene. However,
it runs too close to her conversation with Jane, not to mention
the walk from school at the end. Besides, I'm still a Daria-Trent
Shipper, and ever since I heard the song in &quot;Lane
Miserables&quot;(#308), it tends to leave me a little depressed. <br>
<br>
13)Specifically from their last album &quot;Lovelife.&quot; Yeah,
I know Quinn's hair is so red that dyeing it pink isn't much of a
stretch, but it was either that or making her Marlo Thomas again.
<br>
<br>
14)If you think Jake is scary enough already, imagine him at over
6'5&quot;, with a shaved-pointed head and a case of jaundice.<br>
<br>
15)Miss Cleo, if you don't know is that Caribbean woman on those
tarot card hotline commercials. <br>
<br>
16) Okay, I'll admit she's not exactly who you'd think of when
you use an alter-ego for Jane, but I had to pick somebody besides
Lita Ford or an undetermined Egyptian Princess.<br>
<br>
17)Tracy Turnblad was the overweight teen dancing sensation from
the 1987 John Waters movie &quot;Hairspray.&quot;<br>
