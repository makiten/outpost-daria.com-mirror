FADE IN: Image of Morgendorffer house on a winter's day. Light green credits
dissolve in and out of the screen while Morrissey's "National Front Disco"
plods along.


FADE IN: Abrupt medium shot of Daria sitting her room, in bed, reading a book.
She wears a black shirt and faded jeans. Some moaning and sobbing permeates
the walls.


				DARIA(VO)
		I'm not in denial of the situation. Sure,
		The old man is in the hospital, my mother
		is in hysterics, and my sister hasn't
		said a single word. What do you do when
		your father shows the first sign of age?
		Suddenly, every day is like a wake, you
		go pay him a visit, he's all happy and
		smiling, happy to be alive, right? When
		everyone else is gone, though, the truth
		is too much to bear, and the meds come
		full flow. It all happened tuesday. It
		was trash night, when all the scavenger
		trucks came about-


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD, GARBAGE TRUCKS MAKING A RUCKUS.

				DARIA(VO)
			-to pick up the week's worth
			of garbage, and maybe even
			recyclables if that truck
			was around.

CUT to shot of small, decrepit house with TRUCK in front of it. There is a
ear-shattering smash of glass. An obese, angry man comes bounding out of
the house angrily. 

				ANGRY MAN
			HEY YOU FUCK!!! I'M TRYINA 
			SLEEP HERE!!!!

INT. DARIA'S BEDROOM 

CUT to first shot of Daria reading her book.


				DARIA(VO)
			It was dad's turn to take 
			care of the trash. Hey, I 
			did it all month anyway,
			while he pounded shots of
			scotch into his belly- 


EXT. MORGENDORFFER HOUSE, NIGHT    

JAKE hauls out the can, gasping and sweating. After pulling the can to the 
curb, he turns the thing around. HE makes his way back inside where he coll-
apses in the kitchen, screaming. 

				DARIA(VO) 
			The doctor said he had a coronary. 
			PErfect timing. He was already in
			the midst of male menopause. 


EXT. LAWNDALE HS, DAY 

JANE and DARIA sit at a bench outside during lunch. JANE lights up a 
cigarette and takes a drag while DARIA eats a pickle. 

				JANE(annoyed)  
			Jeez, could you be any noisier
			with your food? 


				DARIA
			Hey, at least I'm not smacking
			my food about the walls of my
			mouth like SOME people we know.

				JANE 
			Or chew with your mouth open only
			to have the pleasure of watching 
			how far your saliva-coated morsels
			will fly. 

				DARIA(sounding sick)
			Now you see why I rarely have lunch. 

				JANE
			My dear, don't you know you're supposed
			to have meals 3 times a day? 

				DARIA
			Really? I thought all you do is munch on 
			snacks all day and gorge yourself at night. 

KEVIN runs at the two with a sly smirk. 

				DARIA
			Well you're certainly jovial today. 

				JANE
			What did you do, leave a bag of your
			own stool in the coach's chair again? 

				KEVIN(smirky, happy) 
			NO! I got my scholarship today! 

				JANE
			And it only took you 10 years
			to finish high school.

				KEVIN
			NO WAY! I'm not 36! 

				DARIA
			Where will you be going?

				KEVIN
			UCLA, babe. I might get to 
			be a Raider! 

				JANE
			Well that's nice. Wanna smoke? 

				KEVIN
			Nah, man, that shit's no good.
			And since when did you start 
			smoking?

				DARIA
			Yeah, just when DID you start 
			smoking? 

				JANE
			Friend gave me a pack of Luckies.
			The old kind. 

BG music: Instrumental version of "MoonRiver" 

				DARIA
			I see. Well, don't turn it into
			a habit. (VO) Sometimes I worry
			about Jane. Graduation's about 
			a week away, and when I head 
			off to UC Davis in Northern 
			California, she won't have me
			around to preoccupy her brain.

INT. DARIA'S ROOM 

CLOSEUP shot of DARIA staring out of a window at a flock of birds flying into
town. Then cut to medium shot of her laying in bed, staring at the ceiling. 

INT. HALL 

HELEN starts calling for DARIA to come downstairs. DARIA creeps out of bed,
still in the day's clothes and walks downstairs. 

INT. LIVING ROOM 

QUINN sips her soda at the couch while HELEN sips tea. DARIA notices that 
QUNN's eyes are reddened and that her mother has seemingly aged overnight.

MEDIUM shot of HELEN as she speaks. 


				HELEN(sounding tired)
			Now girls, I understand that you must
			be under a lot of stress with your
			father having a coronary and your
			moving up in the world of education-

				DARIA(VO)
			Jeez, could she sound any more
			like a CEO grieving over the 
			loss of a janitor?

				HELEN(continuing)
			-so I think it would be best 
			that we all go to a weekly 
			therapy session. 

				  
			     
EXT. LAWNDALE HS COURTYARD, DAY 

WIDE SHOT of Lawndale's students making their way to their classes. Scott
Joplin's "Lily Queen" plays on in the background. Abrupt MEDIUM SHOT of 
DARIA entering classroom. 

INT. DRAMA CLASS 

POV SHOT of teacher ranting to his students. 

				TEACHER(angry monotone)
			As your FINAL project for 
			this class, I'd like you 
			type up an essay tonight
			on the book we studied 
			all year. Failure to do
			this within the week will
			result in failure and the
			most sadistic humiliation
			I could think of, so there.

MEDIUM SHOT of DARIA talking to a friend behind her. HE is a scraggy-haired
gentleman wearing a flannel shirt and a light beard. 

				DARIA
			That's all you have? I thought
			you'd have a little more, after
			all you've been ranting about it
			all week. 


				MALE FRIEND
			I know I know, but I always 
			get to thinkin' about ya and
			all.

				DARIA(sighing) 
			Well, Gerald, you need to quit
			being so counterproductive. I'm
			not the only reason you're alive,
			you know. 

				GERALD 
			I understand, I know. 

				DARIA 
			No, you don't. Now I don't
			want you to mention your 
			script AGAIN until you have 
			it finished. And read, by me. 

				GERALD(nervous) 
			Okay dear, I-I-obey. Say, you
			want to go to the Rag tonight? 

				DARIA(groaning)
			Maybe. I'm not in the mood for Jelly Roll
			Morton.

				GERALD
			Hey, it's up to you. 

				DARIA 
			Well, as long as you don't think
			any less of me. (gives GERALD a
			kiss on the cheek.)

WIDE SHOT of classroom, everyone chatters inanely. 

				DARIA(VO) 
			Won't you be glad to be away
			from these miscreants?

INT. HALLWAY 

				GERALD(bitterly)
			Ah, crap, well I'll probably
			be working alongside 'em at
			some dank, smelly warehouse
			moving bags of flour. 

				DARIA
			What? You're not going to
			college? 

				GERALD
			Community. But I need to work.
			Then move out. 

				DARIA
			Well that's mean. 

JANE approaches the two. 

				DARIA
				Hey. 

				JANE 
			What's going on, lovebirds?

				GERALD
			Nothing here. 

				DARIA 
			Same.(nudges GERALD) He's still
			working on his screenplay.

				JANE(rather astute)
			WEll hey, I know how that is. 
			The painting is almost NEVER
			finished with me. 

INT. PIZZA PARLOR 

WIDE SHOT of JANE and DARIA sitting across from eachother. GERALD approaches
with the tray of pizza while The Cottonpicker's "Statestreet Blues" plods
along. All three then start chatting.


				DARIA(VO)
			It's kind of strange how Gerald
			and I met. It was through this
			obscure internet bulliten board
			about cannibalism. I was studying
			it for history class, and I ran
			into a few absolutely hilarious
			posts he made. I contacted him
			once or twice, got a couple
			passive responses. Then he
			wrote me again, informing me
			that he too had attended Lawndale.

MEDIUM CLOSEUP of GERALD eating and talking

			HE wasn't the most charming, but 
			as soon as I realized how close 
			his mindset was to mine. Gerald
			is generous, funny, and sometimes
			annoying but that's only when he
			gets drunk.


				JANE(making sobbing sounds)
			I can't believe it...my little girl
			is going to college! And worse yet,
			she's going to Northern California! 
			

				DARIA
			Oh, I'll be back every few months. 
			Oh, what're you doing after graduation?

				JANE(jovially)
			Going to work at the Art Shoppe. 


				DARIA
			So you're not getting out of this
			shithole?

				JANE
			Hey, can't afford college. 

				GERALD 
			I hear ya. My parents are both
			security guards. That should tell you
			enough. They won't help me. 

				JANE
			Oh, but they give you a nice computer
			and a stereo that you bragged about 
			for a whole 5 minutes? 
			
				GERALD
			It's a whole other story, dear. 

				DARIA
			Don't say another word. I've
			heard enough, and so have you.

				GERALD
			Mmm-hmm. Sorry. 

				DARIA(patting his shoulder) 
			Don't worry about it kid. (turns to Jane)
			He's severely emotional.  

INT. THERAPIST'S WAITING ROOM

WIDE shot of DARIA, HELEN, AND QUINN. HELEN is visibly depressed, pale, and
frazzle haired. 

				DARIA(VO)
			I don't know what my mother
			thinks will be accomplished 
			in this. (gets up as last
			name is called on PA) 

INT. THERAPIST'S ROOM 

POV shot of HELEN, DARIA, and QUINN listening to therapist.


				THERAPIST 
			I know, it is a hard time
			for young girls like yourselves
			to cope with such difficult
			circumstances. Daria, I-

				DARIA(VO)
			Oh, jeez, I ALWAYS have
			to go first. ALWAYS!!

				THERAPIST
			-must ask you; how have 
			you dealt with this situation?

				DARIA 
			I just accept it. Dad'll
			be out of the hospital 
			soon. 

				THERAPIST(seriously)
			Aren't you, well, don't you
			think you are deluding yourself?
			What if he dies?

				DARIA(leering at her sibling and mother)
			Then he dies.  You can't go on crying for the
			rest of your life. 


ABRUPT MEDIUM CLOSEUP of HELEN

				HELEN
			She doesn't know what she's saying,
			Ms. Chelminski. She's been insular
			for most of her life and has no 
			real concept of human emotions. 

				DARIA
			Is that so, mother? Do I not feel
			hurt when I am insulted? Do I not
			feel murderous when I'm embarassed
			by you and the rest of the clan? 

				QUINN
			Oh, Daria, you've been staying up
			too late lately...an' you know what
			insomnia does.

				DARIA
			What, exactly? 

				QUINN
			You think too damn much.(loudly You always
			look down at people who aren't smart!
			It's like who cares how they feel! They
			don't have any fuckin' brains! Who cares??

				DARIA
			Wow, for once we are in agreement. 

				THERAPIST
			Is that how you truly feel, Daria? 

				HELEN 
			My daughter thinks she's GOD for chrissakes!!
			
				DARIA
			Well, hey, I have to model myself after someone.

				QUINN
			GOD judges, Daria!

				DARIA
			Yep. 


INT. RUSTIC CAFE 

WIDE SHOT of CAFE'S interior. GERALD stands at the jukebox listening to "L.A.
WOMAN" by the Doors. DARIA emerges from the bar with a steaming mug of french 
roast coffee. She approaches GERALD and pokes him in the back, startling him.

				GERALD
			Jeez, w-w-why'd you do that?
			You know I'm a nervous wreck!

				DARIA
			Oh, Gerald, you need to quit
			being so-so wound up. Look at
			yourself! 

				GERALD
			I know-I know You coulda 
			caused me to piss all over 
			myself!

				DARIA(groans)
			Come on, let's go near the window.

ABRUPT MEDIUM CLOSEUP SHOT OF DARIA talking to GERALD 

				DARIA
			So my mother joins in on Quinn's
			tirade. Isn't that sweet? Even at
			my ripe old age of 18 I can't 
			defend myself against my younger
			and dumber relatives. Ugh. 

				GERALD
			I can't believe-I just can't
			believe we've been together for
			over a year, y'know. And-and this'll
			probably-um-be the last two weeks we'll
			see eachother, y'know? I-I-I'm sorry 
			I've just been thinking that way lately. 

				DARIA
			Oh, Gerald, I'll be back! I'll write you
			every week. As long as you do the same, ok?

				GERALD
			BUT-but you know me and my wandering eye, I-I
			see people all the time in my line of work.

				DARIA
			Work? I thought you did screenwriting as 
			a sort of a weekend thing. 

				GERALD
			Yeah, I've been keeping it that way, and
			being that I've been working at the access
			station, people have been reading my scripts
			and getting interested in my ideas. It's=it's
			simply beyond my control. 

				DARIA
			That's wonderful, actually. 

				GERALD(after long pause)
			Yeah, it is! It really is! (kisses Daria) 

				DARIA(kissing GERALD back)
			No wonder I have a hard time seeing you on
			the weekends.

				GERALD
			Don't worry, I'll make time for us
			for the next couple of weeks 'k? I-I
			promise. 

WIDE SHOT OF STAGE as BAND PREPARE THEIR GEAR, STRAP ON THEIR INSTRUMENTS AND
START PLAYING SLOPPILY. DARIA and GERALD approach the closer area to the
stage.

				DARIA
			I know the lead singer.

				GERALD
			I've seen him before. Guy has no
			grain of talent in him whatsoever.

				DARIA
			Eh, give him some time. Though knowing
			him he'll just piss it down the drain.

				GERALD
			Yeah, he plays and looks like the type
			that needs the carpet ripped from under
			his shoes to show him the right way to
			do things.


EXT. STREET 

DARIA and GERALD walk the streets and find themselves gazing at an antique
shop. "I've Got something in my Eye" by Amanda Rudolph plays as they enter the
store.

INT. ANTIQUE SHOP

DARIA and GERALD marvel at old cameras and a vintage guitar. GERALD picks up
the guitar and tries to play it while DARIA looks over a bookshelf. "These
Foolish Things Remind me of You" by Benny Goodman plays as GERALD and DARIA
inspect a book on the life of James Dean.

EXT. MORGENDORFFER HOUSE

It is late in the evening. DARIA walks to front door of her house, looks at
her watch, groans, and keys the door.

INT. DARIA'S BEDROOM

Morrissey's "The More you Ignore Me, the Closer I Get" plays on the radio as
DARIA reads her copy of "The Dead Zone". DARIA is startled by a knock at the
door. She approaches the door and opens it, seeing that it is her mother.

				HELEN
			Daria, I've just received news that
			your father has improved. He'll probably
			be out of the hospital in a couple of days.

				DARIA
			That's nice.

				HELEN
			Daria, could you just show a little
			enthusiasm?

				DARIA
			Well, it's HIS fault, he spent all that
			time pounding down shots when he's supposed
			to be doing something productive with his
			spare time. 

				HELEN(frustrated)
			Look, I'm really fucking tired of this.
			I'm certainly GLAD you know what NOT to do
			in life and that you're going to college. 
			But that gives you NO EXCUSE to be such a 
			cold, callous little bitch. 

				DARIA
			Well, sorry. How do you want me to 
			behave? 

				HELEN
			Like a HUMAN BEING. Just do that until
			you head off to UC Davis, okay? This
			discussion has ended, goodnight. (leaves)

DARIA pulls her boot off and throws it at the padded wall as hard as she
can. 

				DARIA(muttering)
			Annoying. 


EXT. JANE'S HOUSE, THE NEXT DAY.

JANE and DARIA sit outside while JANE smokes her cigarette. 

				DARIA
			It's going to be strange, I can tell. 
			Not having any idiots to bother me, 
			unless, heh, I get those type of roomies. 

				 JANE
			You know, you've been displaying a little
			too much emotion in your voice lately. I 
			think you've been hanging around Gerald a
			little too much. 

				DARIA
			I know, isn't he the flightiest? I can't get
			him to keep still. He might have Parkinson's. 

				JANE
			That's likely. 

				DARIA
			I'm bored shiftless. Shall we
			go torch a church? 

				JANE(rather astute)
			Sorry dear, I have nary the time
			or the supplies for such an ambition. 

				DARIA
			What's Trent up to today? 

				JANE
			Probably same old crap, you know
			those (makes quotes with fingers)
			musician type. 

				DARIA 
			Y'know-

				JANE
			AAAHH!! You are sounding way too much
			like Gerald. 
		
				DARIA
			Well I was just saying...well...I feel
			like, I've been thinking a lot about
			life lately. Ever since my dad had a 
			coronary. I keep thinking, y'know-

				JANE(overlapping)
				SEE??! 

				DARIA
			-I've really missed out on a lot in my
			young life. I've never gotten wasted, I've
			never been to a real rock concert, I've never
			even gotten laid. Let alone really made any real
			money. Have a job. Until I met Gerald, I felt 
			totally alone..'cept for you of course. 

				JANE(takes drag off cigarette) 
			Of course. Well, just be glad you're
			on the high road of life. Accept what
			you have, and don't be so angry. It's
			counterproductive.

				DARIA
			I understand.

				JANE
			NO, you don't. Like Trent you need to have the
			rug pulled out from under ya.

				DARIA
			Maybe you're right.

INT. GARAGE

DARIA and JANE watch TRENT and JESSE pound out some chords, while Abe Lyman's
"Rhumbola" plays. The music fades out as DARIA laughs herself out of the room.
JANE follows her.

				JANE
			You are horrible! 

				DARIA(still giggling) 
			I just couldn't contain myself. 

				JANE(irritated) 
			Well you should. I have to
			watch those two get drunk 
			piss-silly when their self
			esteem is sent to the sewers! 

				DARIA
			Well, sorry. 

				JANE
			Jeez...

INT. RUSTIC CAFE 

DARIA, JANE, and GERALD all sit over espressos, chatting. 

				DARIA(VO)
			Well, graduation's in another
			couple of days. I did all my
			work and officially ended my
			public school chapter of my
			education. Yep. Over 14 years
			of bullshit done and over with.
			Now we can all just reminisce
			about those awful times, go to
			college, and work ourselves into
			a rut.

MEDIUM SHOT OF JANE

				DARIA(VO)
			Jane'll probably leave home to
			go to New York if she has any 
			real passion for her work. 
			Unless she gets into the Academy
			of Art College. 

MEDIUM SHOT OF GERALD		
	
				DARIA(VO)
			I fear for Gerald. I'm afraid
			this recent string of success 
			will harden him and turn him 
			into an asshole. And as for 
			myself, I plan to walk the
			earth. 


EXT. LAWNDALE HIGH SCHOOL, DAY 

(CG reading "Graduation Day" fades in and dissolves)

WIDE shot of courtyard

DARIA, JANE, and GERALD walk around the courtyard looking mournful. JODIE sees
them and waves, her boyfriend's arm around her. JODIE and her beau approach
the trio.

ABRUPT SHOT of group walking


				JODIE
			I've been working alongside these
			idiots on the yearbook, speeches,
			etcetera, heh, I can't even
			believe some of these people are
			even qualified for graduation!

				MACK
			Well hey, you-know-who got a scholarshit-
			oh 'scuse me-scholarship.

				JANE
			Oh, we know about Kevin. Egh.

				JODIE
			Didn't you go to a dance with him once?

				JANE
			Well...

				DARIA
			YOU went to a dance. With Kevin.

				JANE
			Well whatever chemicals were
			mixing in my wasteland of a brain
			caused me to think he had potential.

				MACK
			Potential? As in, a potential convict
			sweating in a warehouse, living in a
			trailor park?

				JODIE(hitting MACK on the arm)
			Don't be mean. 

				DARIA
			How come *I* never knew of this? 

				GERALD
			Some things aren't meant to be known,
			my dear, all men have secrets...

				DARIA
			And what is yours? 

				GERALD
			I had an underage girlfriend once. 

				DARIA(after a pause)
			You what? 

WIDE SHOT OF EVERYONE SITTING IN THE GRASS 

				GERALD 
			It wasn't an opportunist thing! I loved her
			and she loved me.

				DARIA
			Well anyone who's 13 years old usually falls
			in love with higher figures anyway. She must've,
			well, found you charming somehow. 

				JANE(abruptly)
			You buy her candy? Take her out for a walk in the
			fog? 

				GERALD
			Yes! I took her out to a beautiful place for she
			is-was-a beautiful person. 

				MACK
			"WAS"? What, did you kill her and
			incinerate her? 

				GERALD
			NO! I haven't spoken to her in nearly
			2 years. I was 16 and she was 12. 

				JANE
			4 YEARS!!! WHEN YOU WERE A JUNIOR SHE
			WAS BARELY IN MIDDLE SCHOOL!!

				GERALD(agitated)
			WELL JEEZ!! I feel enough guilt about
			it already. You realize how many times 
			I've considered suicide because of this?
			All last month I kept debating with myself
			whether or NOT to wedge a belt the door and
			say fuck it all hell!!

INT. HALLWAY 

DARIA follows GERALD into the stairwell, where he sits down and starts
scribbling into his arm.

				DARIA
			Gerald? I didn't know. and I'm sorry Jane
			hurt your feelings like that.

				GERALD
			Forget it, Daria. Y-y-you got my number
			now. I'm a hopeless goddamn pervert. A
			disgusting pervert!

				DARIA
			No. You're not. You just thought it was
			a good idea at the time.(grabs shoulder)
			I'm not judging you. I couldn't ever do that.

				GERALD
			Maybe we shouldn't speak to eachother again.

				DARIA(frozen)
			What are you talking about? I'm not mad at you. 

				GERALD
			I'm really sorry I had to tell you that side
			of my life. I-I-I felt that you'd probably not
			be upset. But that look-that sort of fiery look you
			had. You-you looked like you thought I was a cock-
			roach. 

				DARIA
			Gerald...ugh...I don't know...maybe you're
			right, maybe we should break up.. 

				GERALD
			You sure? 

				DARIA
			You have a whole life ahead of you. 
			You're very charming-handsome, sweet..
			I don't deserve you. 

				GERALD(grabbing DARIA's shoulder)
			Listen. I'm very lucky to have you. I would
			never take advantage of you. I would never
			ever hurt you...you'll be in college...uh..
			you'll be seeing other people...I'm already
			seeing other people...we could just keep in
			touch, okay? Is that alright?

CLOSEUP shot of DARIA's face, looking fierce, and then sad. 

				GERALD
			A-A-are you crying? Oh God, please,
			don't start crying...I-I can't live 
			with myself...I didn't mean what I 
			said...I'm not seeing anyone, it 
			means little to me...we really 
			should break up. You and I, uh, 
			we should get our lives in order. 
			The both of us. On our own. Look,
			here's what we'll do. You'll go to
			college, do your thing there. I'll
			finish my scripts up, move to San 
			Francisco, and after all that's 
			done we'll live together, if you
			want. You like that? I'll-I'll 
			visit you once a month. Just 
			pretend it's rehab. 


INT. AUDITORIUM 

The atmosphere is like that of a church, with an organ player going at it
with a choir. HELEN and JAKE are in the audience. 


				DARIA(VO)
			After that little fiasco, I got
			a cigarette from Jane and now I
			feel kinda-sorta dizzy. I have 
			only smoked a cigarette once; 
			and that was the only time. I
			took the whole thing, too. 

WIDE SHOT OF STAGE

				DARIA(VO)
			And there I am, walking across
			the stage like everyone else. I
			heard a few applaud. More applauded
			when Jane crossed the stage, grabbed
			hers and walked off. She looked kinda
			pissed. 


EXT. THE COURTYARD, NIGHT

WIDE SHOT of COURTYARD, everyone drinking and chatting, Fats Waller's "Let's
Break the Good News" playing over the scene. Everyone is dressed formally,
dancing, and partying. JANE waltzes with her boyfriend TOM while DARIA and 
GERALD share a cigarette. 

				DARIA
			"The Invasion of the Gulls"? 
			What's it about? 

				GERALD
			That's exactly what it's about, 
			like "The Birds". Only more 
			dramatic and theatrical. 

				DARIA
			Sounds like a ripoff to me. 
			
				GERALD
			Well, it still needs editing. 

				DARIA
			You ever notice that everything
			you do always needs editing? I 
			swear, if you ever get anywhere
			with these scripts it'll amaze me. 

				GERALD
			Well...like Jane said earlier,
			the painting's never finished. 

				DARIA
			Yeah, especially if you don't
			have enough paint, or better yet,
			INSPIRATION. 

				GERALD(hugging DARIA)
			Ah, you know me too well. 

				DARIA
			That I do. (Kisses GERALD) 

WIDE SHOT of KEVIN and BRITTANY in wedding clothes. 

				DARIA
			Just pray that those two never
			breed. 

				GERALD
			I dunno, Daria, she's got that
			3 kid capacity in her guts. 

				DARIA
			I feel nauseous..

MEDIUM shot of GERALD and DARIA 
	
				GERALD
			Whu-what? There something in the 
			punch?

				DARIA
			No. We're in agreement again. 

				GERALD
			Is that bad? I'm not sure...um..
			Still wanna go our seperate ways?


				DARIA
			You know...maybe not. I'm not sure.
			Give me a couple months at UC to think
			okay? 

				GERALD
			Look at all those people. 

WIDE SHOT of courtyard full of people

				GERALD
			Don't you ever wish we could-

				DARIA
			To an extent.  

				GERALD
			I always knew ya had a bit of optimism in ya. 

				DARIA
			Thanks.(hugs GERALD) 

JANE pokes DARIA, causing her to start

				DARIA
			Jeez! Why'd you do that for? 

				JANE
			This place digusts me. Can
			we spend our final non-college
			slash life moments at a warmer, 
			more intimate place? 

				DARIA
			Ah, alright. 

INT. PIZZA PARLOUR 

WIDE SHOT OF PIZZA PARLOUR, EVERYONE INSIDE EATING AND CHATTING

				DARIA(VO)
			So this is where it began. And
			This is where it all comes to 
			an abrupt end. 


EXT. MORGENDORFFER HOUSE, NIGHT

Gulls are picking through the garbage as Rudy Wiedoeft's "Velma" plays.
JAKE comes storming out of the house angrily with a broom. 

				JAKE
			Go on! Get outta here! Aw, man...
			(POV shot of garbage strewn all over
			lawn) 

Gulls fly away, their guts full. 

				JAKE
			CHRIST ALLMIGHTY!! GODDAMN BIRDS!!! 

INT. LIVING ROOM 

HELEN yells at JAKE to get his ass inside. 

				HELEN
			You gotta take your medication dear!
			Remember! I'm going to work now!

				JAKE
			Aaaw, alright...(muttering)
			christ Jakey what's your
			SPINE made of, WET NOODLES??
			(throws shovel) FUCK THIS 
			MESS!!


INT. LANE HOUSE 

GERALD and DARIA lay next to eachother in front of the TV. ABRUPT medium shot
of JANE and boyfriend TOM making out in the kitchen WIDE shot of DARIA and
GERALD laying next to eachother.

				DARIA
			I'm having second thoughts about
			college...

				GERALD(stroking her face)
			Well, you shouldn't. I think you'll
			ream those other college students.
			Hell, you did that to everyone at
			Lawndale. Even me! I-I barely finished
			you know.

				DARIA
			Why? 

				GERALD
			Well, you know me...I daydream
			too much. Mentally I have the
			capacity of a diseased slug. 

				DARIA
			No surprise. Say, we haven't
			really made out lately...only once.

				GERALD
			You mean sexual intercourse? 
			I've been trying to avoid it. 
			Haven't had any in over a year.

				DARIA
			You mean you...? 

				GERALD
			It was an impulse! 

				DARIA
			Oh, Gerald...(kisses him)

				GERALD
			You look lovely tonight. 

				DARIA
			Thanks...(kisses him) 

				GERALD
			Oh...(muffles self in DARIA'S 
			shoulder) you smell like a
			winter rose.

INT. KITCHEN

				JANE
			You make the best pasta I've
			ever tasted!

				TOM
			Thank you dear. My dad
			was a chef at a deli once.
			Taught me how to cook on my
			own since mom has no talent
			in the kitchen.

				JANE
			I make yummy salads. You know
			olive oil is good for your hair 
			too? 

				TOM 
			Yeah...hmm...got any wine around here?

JANE motions towards the redwood liquor cabinet

				JANE
			White wine or red?

				TOM
			Red wine is good. 


INT. LIVING ROOM 

WIDE shot of couch and TV. DARIA and GERALD lay there, silent. 

				DARIA
			That took longer than I thought it would.

				GERALD
			Sadly, it's true. You're not having
			second thoughts about college still, are you?
			I really want you to go.

				DARIA
			And I want you to make it in the movies. 
			My college work'll probably not even
			amount to anything. Look at my parents. 
			They went, and-and now they're just middle
			class worker drones. 

				GERALD
			And what'll I be? Probably another
			wayward screenwriter. Making a couple
			grand per script. 

				DARIA
			You should direct. You'd make a 
			good director too. 

				GERALD
			Argh, I have next to no discipline!
		
				DARIA
			And since when did anyone in the
			entertainment business need that? 

				GERALD(flustered)
			All the time. All the time!

				DARIA
			I ever tell you that you have
			a wonderful technique? 

				GERALD
			Huh? What? 

				DARIA(leans her head on GERALD)
			Oh, forget it. 

EXT. MORGENDORFFER HOUSE 
(brief shot of HOUSE) 

INT. DARIA'S BEDROOM 

GERALD helps DARIA pack up her few things. "You've Got to Be Modernistic" by
Clarence Williams and his Jazz Kings plays on as they get everything together.

					DARIA(VO)
				Today's the day I say goodbye to this
				wretched town. For awhile, anyway.
				Gerald's been sullen the whole time he's
				been here helping me pack. It's mostly
				books and valuables, including a skull
				that I've had for most of my life. My
				did gave it to me for some reason.

EXT. AIRPORT

DARIA and GERALD are in an embrace that seems to last forever. 

					GERALD(muffled, crying)
				I'm going to miss you so much...
				I won't do anything to break up..
				
					DARIA
				Ssssh. Come on, you're
				embarassing me. I'll 
				come back. (VO) I wonder,
				what was worse, the scene
				my parents gave when they 
				drove me out here or this? 	
				What a clingy individual.
				I just love this guy. 

					GERALD
				If you can, give me a call, 
				alright? You better, or-or
				who knows what'll happen!
				(laughs)

					DARIA
				Goodbye, Gerald. (give 
				GERALD a warm kiss before
				walking to the plane.

INT. AIRPLANE 

DARIA sits, reading her diary, smirking to herself. She pulls out a pen
and adds more. 

				DARIA(VO)
			So ends this chapter of my life. 
			I'm just happy it didn't end on
			a sour note. Unless, well, there's
			turbulence on the plane. But I'm not
			worried about that as much as I worry
			about Gerald. I'll see him again soon, 
			maybe. I just hope my roomates aren't
			gorillas. 

EXT. HORIZON, THE PLANE SOARING INTO THE SKY 

GERALD watches the plane outside. CLOSEUP shot of GERALD, a tear leaking down
his face, and a cigarette hanging from his mouth. "THE END" is written into
the screen in cursive form.

WIDE SHOT OF PLANE DISSAPPEARING, "These Foolish Things Remind me of You"
plays as the light green credits roll upward.

WIDE SHOT DISSOLVES UNDER CREDITS, "National Front Disco" plays until the
