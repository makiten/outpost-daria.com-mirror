<div>Rated: PG-13<p><b>Short Summary:</b><p>It's Halloween, and someone at
Lawndale High is taking the holiday far too seriously. A Lovecraftian tale of
madness, magic and social events.<p>This story uses the Comic Sans MS font for
the journal entries.  You won't see that on fanfiction.net since they strip font
identification, and you won't see it if you got this story elsewhere if you
don't have that font installed.  That's fine; it doesn't change the story. But I
think it does add something if you can see the "handwritten" journal
entries.<p>Daria (and associated characters and locations) is copyright &#169;

</div>
<div>Helen Morgendorffer brushed a tear from her eye as she lifted her
daughter's salt-encrusted jacket from the box of possessions the police had
provided.  It really was past saving, but she didn't want to just throw it away.
It had been Daria's constant possession for so long, discarding it felt like a
betrayal of her daughter's memory. She resolved to have it cleaned, and moved to
set it aside.<p>
As she folded it, her hand encountered an object in the inside
pocket.  She pulled out a small, leather-bound volume held closed by a rubber
band, one of Daria's journals. It appeared to have been soaked recently, but the
tight cover had kept the pages from harm.  Curiosity got the better of her, and
she opened it to a page near the end and began to read.<p>

Jane's really getting carried away by
Halloween this year.  She spent the weekend sketching designs for a sculpture
for the school party on Wednesday. She even talked me into borrowing Dad's car
and driving to the University library so she could do research.  I hesitated at
first: research for a sculpture? But there's no such thing as a bad excuse to
visit a library.</font><p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">
After three years as best
friends we make a good team. I looked in nineteenth-century archaeology journals
for pagan rituals, while she sketched, using the pictures and inscriptions I
found for inspiration. Interesting reading, although the distinction between
science and speculation seems to have been lost on some of the authors. Not to
mention the patronizing attitude of most of the "educated" scientists towards
the "primitives" they were studying. From where I'm sitting, some of those
scientists were less civilized than the people they claimed were
inferiors.</font><p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">
I'm not sure what Central
American pagan cults have to do with a European Christian holiday (Halloween is
the eve of Hallowmass on 11/1), but Jane mumbled something about everything
being connected. Artistic license, I suppose. Still, it was a fun way to spend a
day. School will be mindlessly dull in comparison. But then, school is
mindlessly dull anyway.</font><p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">

<font face="Comic Sans MS">
Another wasted study hall.  At
least O'Neill has the duty this week, so I can write what I want.  If it were
DeMartino, I'd have to do actual homework.  Of course, if it were O'Neill's
ladylove, Barch, I'd be able to go to the library and
read.</font><p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">
Jane gets to leave study hall to work
on her art project--Defoe is such a soft touch--why can't I get a pass
too?</font><p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">
It's all Li's fault. She's really been
cracking down on hall passes lately, ever since someone put a web-cam in the
girls' showers; as if it weren't obvious who did that. But that's Lawndale: the
guilty go free, while the innocent
suffer.</font><p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">
And speaking of suffering: the
school is abuzz with speculation about Wednesday's party. It starts at 10 PM,
after younger siblings are done trick-or-treating, and apparently there's a big
event planned for midnight, but nobody who knows the details is talking. Rumors
range from a giant pumpkin Pinata (oh, please!) to a celebrity appearance (as if
Li would pay for one!). My money is on the scariest announcement of all: eight
more hours until school.  I intended to be home reading something appropriate to
the holiday, perhaps some Poe, or maybe Dracula
again.</font><p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">
How Li talked the school board into
allowing this on a weeknight is a mystery, rivaled only by the question of why. 
She probably has some scheme to get media coverage for the school (and herself,
of course).</font><p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">
Monday, 29 October, 9:12
PM</font><br>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">
 I stopped in to see Jane after school. 
She was working on the sculpture in the art room.  Defoe gave her a key and Jane
plans to stay there late.  She seemed distracted. Said that working alone was
really inspiring her.  I took that as a hint to leave; I'm not sure she
noticed.</font><p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">
The high point of the day was
getting home in time to see Quinn having a panic attack.  It seems her date,
Jeffy, stood her up.  Apparently this is the first time that's ever happened. 
Like I can talk.  I've only dated Tom.  He doesn't have the guts to stand me up.
That's a terrible thing to say about my boyfriend, isn't it?  Well, what did you
expect, sloppy sentiment? Right, I'm glad we've got that
straight.</font><p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">
I suggested she call up Joey or
Jebedieh (or whatever the third one's name is), since they were all
interchangeable anyway.  Quinn just glowered at me.  I didn't know she knew how.
Imagine, Quinn not talking. She must be
upset.</font><p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">
Tuesday, 30 October, 12:22
PM</font><br>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">
I brought Jane her lunch.  She
practically inhaled it; I think she forgot to eat dinner last night. I might as
well be alone for all the attention I'm getting here, but that's Jane in a
creative frenzy.  I should be used to it by now, although her intensity this
time is almost frightening.</font><p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">
The rough
sculpture is done, and she's working on adding detail. It's a pyramid of some
kind, looks vaguely Mayan, but not quite.  There's something wrong about the
proportions, but I can't figure out what.  I spent some time looking at it,
trying to determine why it makes me uneasy, but I gave up. And now I have a
pounding headache, probably from the paint fumes in
here.</font><p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">
Quinn's date is the talk of the
school. Apparently Jeffy never went home last night after football practice. 
Nobody knows where he went.  The cops were in talking to the other two J's. 
Quinn's walking around wearing dark glasses and a scarf; trying to avoid her
"friends". I overheard Sandi making cutting remarks to the other two fashion
zombies, so perhaps my sister's got the right idea. I'd suspect Sandi of foul
play, but she's too dumb to pull it
off.</font><p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">
Speaking of disappearances, O'Neill's
out sick today, so we had Barch for study hall. It was easy to get permission to
"help" Jane with her sculpture. Barch seemed distracted, probably up late
nursing poor Timothy, or something.  Maybe he's not sick at all.  Maybe she got
carried away and injured him. I don't think I want to think about that.  This
just leaves History to ruin the
afternoon.</font><p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">
Tuesday, 30 October, 10:00
PM</font><br>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">
What a day.  The police arrested
DeMartino during History class. Apparently they found bloodstains on the trunk
of his car.  Human blood.  I told Jane.  I thought that would get through to
her, but she just nodded and said "it's begun."  I couldn't get any sense out of
her.</font><p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">
This sucks.  Jeffy was a self-centered
idiot, but even he doesn't deserve a shallow grave somewhere.  Quinn's
devastated.  Mom's threatening to sue for mental duress.  I think Dad's blaming
his father, but it was hard to make out what he was raving about.  I'm not too
happy either. I sat with Quinn in her room for nearly an hour and held her while
she cried, but we were alone and I'll deny it ever
happened.</font><p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">
Wednesday, 31 October, 2:44
AM</font><br>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">
Jane just left.  She woke me up an hour
ago by throwing gravel at my window.  How high school. There's a full moon
tomorrow but a storm is moving in, and the night was pitch black with no moon or
stars for light. At first I didn't see her, and she had to yell before I would
go down and let her in, but nobody noticed.  It's a good thing she wasn't a
burglar.</font><p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">
The sculpture's finished and
baking in the school kiln. She said that tonight, at midnight, a portal to
another dimension is going to open, and some really nasty deity is going to come
through.  She wasn't amused when I asked if it looked like a giant marshmallow
man. </font><p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">
I asked her how she knew all this,
and she said something about second-sight running in her family, and the power
that DeMartino had invoked manifesting as visions.  Weird.  I'd think the paint
fumes were getting to her, but she's been exposed to much worse without effect,
unless you count a tendency to oversleep, and I think that's genetic.
</font><p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">
Anyway, she wants me to help her with some
ceremony.  I asked if it involved blood, and she said no, just candles, and
nudity.  Great. It's Halloween, and I'm going as a witch. The things I do for
friendship.</font><p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">
Wednesday, 31 October, 1:27
PM</font><br>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">
Study hall again. O'Neill's still out,
and now Barch is among the missing too.  They've got Manson watching us.  I
think she's worried about the effect of Jeffy's disappearance on the other
students.  She tried some psychobabble on me earlier, but I made her go away. I
think it was when I suggested that it was something O'Neill and Barch ate that
had disagreed with them.  She turned white and ran for the Ladies' room. She
didn't come back. I've never liked her, but that may have been excessive.  I've
been reading too much about those cults and it's affected my already twisted
sense of humor.</font><p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">
I convinced Quinn to skip
the party tonight. It wasn't hard, since her friends seem to be blaming her for
Jeffy's disappearance. I suppose it's a form of denial, but do they have to take
their problems out on my sister? Some days I think this town deserves to be
razed to the ground and the earth salted. But I'm still going to help Jane. 
It's purely selfish: I live here
too.</font><p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">
Wednesday, 31 October, 7:00
PM</font><br>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">
Jane came over for dinner, and then we
retired to my room to plan for the party. Jane brought a really old book she
"borrowed" from the University.  It's in German, which neither of us read, but
she's been translating parts of it with a dictionary. If she's right about the
ceremony DeMartino was planning, it's much worse than I
thought.</font><p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">
According to Jane, DeMartino was
going to sacrifice the students at the party to this god, in exchange for wealth
and power. Sounds like a fair trade to me. He wouldn't have been working alone,
and his accomplices are likely to try to continue without him. She said that
what they're probably going to get without his help is a fast-track to the
afterlife. Yeah, who didn't see that one
coming?</font><p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">
Her sculpture is some kind of lock,
to seal the door before this squid-god or whatever can come through and make a
meal out of Lawndale.  She thinks we can stop it before the sacrifice.  I hope
so.  All kidding aside, not even my idiot classmates deserve to be an
appetizer.</font><p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">
Wednesday, 31 October, 10:45
PM</font><br>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">
Jane and I are locked in a storeroom
beside the gym, along with the sculpture.  It's been fired, and Jane had painted
symbols all over it first so now they're baked on.  I tried to look at it, and
it pulled my eyes somewhere else.  It's like a 3-D Escher painting.  I don't
think it's entirely in the same four dimensions I'm
occupying.</font><p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">
Even though the storm finally
broke, and it's raining buckets outside, the party is in full swing next door,
so it wasn't hard to get away.  O'Neill and Barch even made it. They came as
mer-people or something: scaled skin and webbed fingers.  Their costumes are
professional: body-paint and latex appliances. At least, I hope they're
costumes. They bear an unsettling resemblance to one of the illustrations in
Jane's book.</font><p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">
Jane said it was obvious that
they are here to finish the ceremony.  I asked her why we didn't just call the
cops. She laughed.  Good point.  Lawndale's finest would lock someone up, but it
would almost certainly be us.</font><p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">
Wednesday, 31
October, 11:30 PM</font><br>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">
Li just made a PA
announcement.  We can hear it through the ventilation ducts. Just before
midnight there's going to be a ceremony in the gym to invoke the spirit of the
holiday. What drivel. She wants everyone to chant along with her. The sheep will
no doubt go to their slaughter happily
bleating.</font><p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">
Wednesday, 31 October, 11:58
PM</font><br>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">
I'm standing here, naked, watching Jane
draw a pentagram on the floor around the pyramid with a red marker pen. I'd be
embarrassed if I wasn't so scared. Not horror movie scared, but really,
deep-down, adrenaline-pumping scared. I asked Jane, rhetorically, if we were
going to be okay. She shrugged. She didn't say anything.  That can't be a good
sign. </font><p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">
We're running late: the first marker
pen dried up before Jane was done and I had to break into Coach Morris' desk. I
can hear chanting coming through the ducts.  And something's answering the
chant.  A voice I can't quite hear, but I know it's speaking. Even though I
can't understand the words, there's an attraction to them that's hard to resist.
There's a smell of salt in the air too, like the ocean, but there's no ocean
near Lawndale. </font><p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">
Jane's almost ready, so
I'll have to put my pen down shortly. The chanting's stopped. I can hear waves
crashing somewhere, and there are screams from the gym.  Horrible
screams.</font><p></div>

<div>Helen set the journal down.  That was the last page with writing, and the
ink was blurry, as if the page had been soaked before the ink dried. What had
happened at that school, anyway? The jacket had been found with other clothing
in a room near the gym, presumably where the girls had changed into their
costumes. Most of the students had survived, but none were coherent, and many
bore strange lacerations that looked like whip marks. The police said they
couldn't identify any of the bodies in the gym until the autopsy, and they
wouldn't let her see them either.  She'd thought it just stupid bureaucracy, and
had already filed for an injunction. But if her daughter's journal was to be
believed, maybe it was something worse.<p>She set the book down, and hugged
herself, shivering.  Her shivering turned to uncontrollable sobs.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>The slim figure pulled itself from the languid waves of the thick, almost
viscous sea onto the black sand of the beach, underneath a setting sun turned
blood-red by low clouds. Another figure crawled from the surf nearby, its pale
body lashed with red welts.  It dragged a hand through tangled hair, clearing
its eyes, to look at the first figure through cracked glasses.<p>"Well, Jane,
this is another fine mess you've gotten us into."<p></div>
<div align="CENTER"><b>THE END</b>
			<hr>

<div><p><b>Author's Notes:</b><p>This story was finished just before the
terrorist attack on the World Trade Towers.  I had been considering delaying
publication until Halloween was closer anyway, but that event decided me. Nobody
needs to read a horror story when you can see one on the news.  I later made
some minor changes to improve the flow of the story, but it's essentially
unchanged.<p>I've wanted to write a Lovecraftian horror story for months now
(ever since Brian Taylor wrote <i>The Statement of Daria Morgendorffer</i>,
actually), but I could never find the inspiration.  Then inspiration struck.  As
far as I know, nothing specific kicked it off.  I haven't even read any horror
stories since spring.  Well, okay, a couple of vampire stories, but nothing
Lovecraftian. Weird.<p>I was actually planning to write a more "normal" Daria
story after my last one, as I try to alternate mainstream stories with the
really outre ones, if only to keep myself grounded.  But my muse was having none
of it, so here I am.<p>Lovecraft fans may recognize the "German book" as
Unaussprechlichen Kulten, by von Juntzt, one of Lovecraft's many fictional
occult books.<p>For those who aren't familiar with Lovecraft, his Cthulhu
Mythos stories involve a group of beings from another universe that came to this
one millions (or billions) of years ago. Some of their slaves, including
Cthulhu, escaped and set themselves up as deities.  Later they were recaptured
and sentenced to various exiles (Cthulhu lies in semi-eternal slumber on the
usually sunken island of R'lyeh in the Pacific Ocean). Various followers (human
and other) periodically try to restore them to power, generally with really
unpleasant results. Cthulhu, also known as Lord of the Watery Abyss, has a group
of lizard-like followers who may be devolved humans, and who live in undersea
cities.  He sends his dreams out to them and receptive humans to influence them
in an attempt to escape his prison.<p>Lovecraft was also noted for the
fictional occult books that were mentioned so seriously in his stories, people
would bother used bookstores looking for copies.  In addition to von Juntzt's
book, the Necronomicon is frequently mentioned, and has even had several
purported "translations" written.  <i>The Necronomicon: The Dee Translation</i>
(Lin Carter, 1989, reprinted in The Necronomicon, Chaosium publications, 1996)
is the most complete of these, and notes that when conjuring Cthulhu that
Hallowmass (November first) is the best day, (it also notes that when it falls
on a new moon the rites are easier and that having it fall on a Monday is best,
but I didn't use those here, as there isn't going to be a new moon on November
first for more years than my lunar phase tables show; maybe that's why it went
wrong :-)).<p>Lovecraft's stories often end with the hero dying, or worse (he
was quite inventive with the "or worse" scenarios, too).  I didn't think that
appropriate for a Daria story, but being dumped in the middle of the Pacific
Ocean, on an island that's probably due to submerge in short order, isn't
exactly a happy ending. Maybe they'll find a way off.  I'll leave that to your
imaginations; I'm not planning a sequel.<p>The idea for a journal style (and
the use of the Comic Sans MS font) I took from another Daria story I'd read last
year, <i>North Star</i> by Wouter Jaegers. Journal entries are a natural for a
Lovecraftian tale; most of his stories are first-person narratives.<p>"She
wasn't amused when I asked if it looked like a giant marshmallow man." -
Ghostbusters was very Lovecraftian in its use of a special building, constructed
by cultists, for the summoning of a gateway to another world.
			<p>Happy holidays, and watch out for those school parties...</p>
