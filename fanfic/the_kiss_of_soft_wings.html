<P>The view from Lovers Lane was beautiful -- stars twinkling above, the
lights of Lawndale twinkling below. Candlelight Dinner at Chez Pierre had
been perfect, rounded by a bottle of Orgueil de France. Expensive, but
worth it.. &quot;This,&quot; thought Jamie, &quot;has to be the night.&quot;</P>

<P>They were sitting in the back seat of his BMW, the warm air wafting
the heady scent of a clear summer evening through the open windows. Quinn's
breath was warm and sweet on his cheek as she nibbled his ear, sending
little tingles down his spine. She undid his belt buckle, then his pants.
His breathing quickened. </P>

<P>&quot;Quiiiiinn...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Jamaaaaaal - I mean Jaaaaaaamie...&quot;</P>

<P>Her hand slid down inside his pants and he involuntarily arched his
back. Her breath became heavier in his ear as she planted little kisses
on his cheek, moving down his neck.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, Quinn, yes, yes, aaaahhhh…&quot;</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>&quot;Good morning, Quinn honey.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Morning Mom.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;How was your date last night?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Great.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Would you like some breakfast?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No, I'm still full from last night. I feel as if I had two dinners.
I'm going to have to diet for a week.&quot;</P>

<P>Detective Sergeant Kowalski looked with distaste at the stain on the
pants of his latest case and thought &quot;Oh well, at least the poor sap
died happy.&quot;</P>

<P>What worried him, though, wasn't what he'd been doing when he died.
</P>

<P>The corpse was ghostly. He'd been dead for about twelve hours and was
stone cold, but that didn't account for the fact that the skin was pallid
and almost transparent.</P>

<P>What worried him most was that there wasn't a drop of blood anywhere.
With puncture marks like that in the carotid artery there should have been
buckets of it all over the car. </P>

<P>FIN</P>

<P>This came about after a discussion with Renfield about whether Quinn
is predator or prey. Guess which line I took?</P>
