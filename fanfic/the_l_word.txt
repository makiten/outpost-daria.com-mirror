The "L" Word
  by Medea42 aka Diana Rajchel Olsen or Rajchel...whatever

Act I: Scene I:

Setting: The Pizza King, evening. Tom and Daria
are sitting across from each other, absorbed in
conversation. Daria has a dozen roses sitting on the
table beside them, and they are holding hands
across the table.

Daria: No one has every given me flowers before,
unless you count the time Quinn tried to bury
me alive.

Tom: It's about time someone changed that. Besides,
roses are perfect for you - ideal beauty and still
plenty of thorns. Perfect, even in its imperfection.

Daria: Just worship me as the goddess I am.

[both laugh].

Change angle so viewer can see Trent come in over Tom's,
shoulder. Neither Daria nor Tom notice him, they
are so absorbed in each other. Trent takes the booth
directly behind them, and just sits there, evidently
listening.

Tom: Daria, there's been something else I really
want to tell you --

Daria: That you're really a double agent for Cuba,
and you need to board your orange crate and head
home for your report to Castro?

Tom: [laughs] no, I quit that. Socialist health
insurance has too many pitfalls. [changes tone]
Seriously, I want to tell you something.

Daria: Shatter me with your news. What?

Tom: I love you.

[silence. Daria has "deer in headlights" expression]

Flash back to Trent, over Tom's shoulder.
Trent is frowning, not quite glowering but definitely
not amused.

Tom: Daria? Daria, please say something.

[long pause]

Daria: [looking fixedly at the table]
Um, that's really flattering.

Tom: [sighs] I mean it.

Daria: I know. Um, I've gotta go -
[stands up quickly, and knocks flowers on floor.
Takes off without noticing].

Tom sinks in his seat.
Tom: [hits table, says to her retreating back]
How many more walls, Daria? [slumps over table].

Cut to Trent. A waitress asks him for his order.
Trent: No thanks. I've just lost my appetite.

[Trent rises and leaves, a few moments after Daria.
Tom doesn't see him].

Act I: Scene II: Business sector of Lawndale, Daria
is near the video store. Trent pulls his car beside
her.

Trent: Hey Daria

Daria: [she is frowning]Oh, hey Trent.

Trent: Need a ride?

Daria: No thanks, I think I need to walk.

Trent: C'mon, I haven't seen you in awhile. I've
missed you. We always have such great talks.

Daria: Um, well, [blushes] I've been around, and
I still come over to hang out with Jane

Trent: Yeah, but it hasn't been just us in forever.
Come on Daria, I really want to spend some time
with you.

Daria: Uh, OK. [she opens the passenger door in
Trent's car and slides in].

Trent: You look a little down - wanna talk about it?

Daria: I never want to talk about it.

Trent: That's cool.

[driving for a few moments]
Daria: um, Trent, where are we going?

Trent: someplace cool. or not. whatever.

Daria: [looks confused]OK.

Trent: I wanna show you something - I think you'll
really like it.

[switch shot: Trent's car parking across the street
from the giant Strawberry].

Trent: Wait a sec. I want to make sure there are
no cops around --

Daria: Yes, the strawberry offers such a den for criminals like us.

Trent does his laugh/cough thing. Good one, Daria.
[looks around] OK, it's clear. Follow me.

[Daria follows Trent around the back of the strawberry.
On the other side, the viewer sees a door to the strawberry,
slightly ajar. Trent pokes his head in, and then
motions for Daria to follow him.]

Daria: What am I getting myself into?
[she ducks into the doorway as well. We see that
Trent has climbed a ladder, and we see Daria follow
him, joining him on a platform near the leafy section
of the strawberry. Trent helps Daria settle herself,
then he points out a small window. ].

Trent: Look

Daria: Oh joy, suburbia.

Trent: yeah, it really inspires some of my darkest
stuff. I come here when I need to get in touch
with my own depression. You're the first person I've
ever shown this place. Even Janey doesn't know about
it.

Daria: Endless streetlights and unbearably similar
houses -- ah, the good cheer of conformity.

Trent smirks.

Daria: Trent, why did you take me here?

Trent: Because you're getting to a point where you're
gonna need a place like this. I love you, Daria, and
I want you to know about the places where you can
have the good kind of alone.

[Trent reaches out and takes her hand. Daria and
Trent sit in silence, holding hands and gazing out
into the Lawndale night. Daria is blushing.].

Act I: Scene 3: Lawndale high, Jane and Daria are
at their lockers. Daria looks frazzled and exhausted.
Her hair is sticking up wildly, and her glasses, despite
her best efforts, hang crookedly on her face.

Jane: You look like the Sick Sad World hairdos and
blenders episode. What happened?

Daria: I just had a really weird night last night,
and I didn't get in until five.

Jane: Oh? and how did Jake and Helen take your
nightcat philanderings?

Daria: I think I'm grounded, but I'm not sure. I was
busy working out the complexities of the cereal bowl,
and Mom talks a lot anyway. I never knew cereal
could have such a mind of its own. I spent most of breakfast
putting it back in the bowl; it wouldn't go there when
I poured it.

Jane: [sly grin] Daria Morgendorffer! YOU, of all
people, break the sacred curfew? You and Tom must
have had some night!

Daria: Actually, I didn't spend much time with Tom
last night. I -

[Jodie walks up behind Daria, and interrupts.]
Jodie: Jane, Daria, I need to beg a favor of you.

Jane: If it involves anything extra-curricular, you
already know the answer.

Jodie: [smirking]This extra curricular you two may particularly find
worthwhile.

Jane: Oh?


Jodie: Mack and I have found the ultimate way to
break Kevin of some of his more annoying habits.
And it involves much mayhem and torture of the
shallow masses.

[Off screen: Kevin: Hey, Mac-Daddy, catch this!
Mack: stop calling me that!]

Jodie:[beat] Especially torturing Kevin. You're gonna love it.

Jane: If it involves torturing Kevin, I'm all for it. Might even get
me some much needed extra credit with Ms. Barch. How about you Daria?
Up for breaking the spirit of the rah-rah crowd?

[Daria is leaning against her locker, snoring. Jane
shakes her awake].

Jane: Geez, is Trent rubbing off on you?

Daria: [becomes very alert at the name of Trent].
Trent!? I haven't seen him. Idon'tknowanything.

Jane: [to Jodie] I think the pressures of Daria's
new social life are getting to her a little bit,
so perhaps we should pardon her from association
with this crime.

Jodie: [looking curiously at Daria] I would have
to agree.

Jane and Jodie start walking towards class. Daria
is still staring at her locker, confused.
Jane walks back and grabs Daria by the shoulder.
Jane: The door you need to stare at is this way,
Daria.

Daria: Door? there's a door, too -- and a bat. In the sky.

Jane continues to guide Daria, possibly in the direction
of one of her classes.



Act II: Scene I: Jane and Jodie are working in what appears to be
a sound/video lab.

Jane: Wow, Ms. Li certainly managed to garner enough equipment.

Jodie: Yeah, thanks to her yearly updates on the surveillance system
we actually have pretty good equipment for the Media and Communications
club.

Jane: We have a media club?

Jodie: Yes, per Ms. Li and the glory of Lawndale high, we're supposed
to introduce a telecast next week - including in-house ads.

Jane: And what about this project should appeal to me?

Jodie: Let me show you some of the more interesting equipment donated
to us from Ms. Li...

[fade scene]

Act II: Scene II: Morgendorffer home. Quinn is in her room, chattering
on the phone.

Quinn: Of COURSE I did the homework Sandi -- really, if we want to
get into Pepperhill it's NOT such a big deal to sacrifice a date or two.
Besides, Bobby was so cute and bought me pens to coordinate with my
outfits -

[Daria appears in her doorway, still looking haggard and messy. Quinn sees
her, and drops phone].

Quinn: Oh my God! What happened to you!?

Daria: Uh -

[Quinn grabs phone]. Quinn: Sandi, this is a MAJOR fashion emergency,
I HAVE to go. I'll call you as soon as the situation is no longer
critical. [hangs up phone]. Daria, I know you could care less about your
looks, but you have a BOYFRIEND now, you HAVE to do SOME maintenance.
My God, you usually at least bathe --

Daria: I'm too tired to want to kill you right now. I need some advice.

Quinn: You need advice from ME!? [beat] Don't tell me Jane is still
mad at you about the Tom thing -

Daria: this is really something I can't ask Jane about -

Quinn: Is it Tom? Did he do something to you? Did you do something
with him?

Daria: no Quinn, Tom does not have a case of naughty tentacles.
Before you ask, no one ELSE does either. It's just, um, he told me something -


Quinn: What? Did he tell you he's dying? Oh that would be SO romantic -

Daria: No Quinn, he's not dying. and I for one DON'T find the idea
of dating a corpse romantic -

Quinn: Well, what did he tell you? Out with it Daria! I get so sick of
you and the way you always have to drag everything out -

Daria: Tom told me he loved me.

Quinn's mouth dropped open.

Quinn: He WHAT!?

Daria: He gave me some roses, and we were talking, and he said "Daria, I
love you." And then Tre-- someone else said the same thing to me.

Quinn: [begins pacing]. Daria, this is TERRIBLE. You have to break up
with him RIGHT NOW!

Daria: huh?

Quinn: Oh really, first he says he loves you, and then he wants to
be with you exclusively all the time -- not that you're all that
unavailable anyway, and it wouldn't make a difference for YOU, but
it's a principle --

Daria: If sleep weren't fogging my brain, I'd be out of here already.
But since I'm already too exhausted for your drivel to numb my brain,
what about the other guy?

Quinn: Oh, him? Make sure that Tom and he know about each other. Having
guys fight over you would do wonders for your popularity. Daria, are
you even going to think about what I'm saying? Daria?

[Daria is leaning against Quinn's bedroom wall, snoring].

Quinn: [to herself] Two guys? Huh - she's just delusional from lack of sleep.

Act 2: Scene 3:
Jane and Jodie are still in the lab, and they are looking at a screen.
Jodie: Perfect. Jane, you have a real knack for this stuff.

Jane: Thank you. I have to admit, I am both surprised by and really
admire this new subversive streak of yours.

Jodie: I wouldn't be so subversive if I let it show all the time.

Jane: Right you are, amiga. [stretches]. So, when does this experiment
commence?

Jodie: Tomorrow morning. I would like to borrow a test audience though -

Jane: [conspiratorial tone] Now who could we interest in watching three
hours of football and cheerleading footage?

Jodie: now who around here has a Pavlovian respone to the pigskin channel?

Jane: Hm, a certain obnoxious quarterback.

Jodie: Exactly.

Jane: I feel a need to eat and to find out exactly what Daria's adventures
were last night. Meet you back here later?

Jodie: Sure thing. I'll gather up Kevin and Brittany, and tomorrow
we should have our results.

[scene fades]

Act 2: Scene 4:
[Daria's room. She looks somewhat better rested than before, and most
of her hair is laying the directions it usually does].

Helen, OS: Daria, Jane's here.
[Jane appears at Daria's door at that moment].
Daria: [bolts upright]Yah!

Jane: And hello to you too, o paranoid one.

Daria: [sits up] I wasn't expecting anyone.

Jane: I would have called, but Trent is on this weird phones-and-tones
kick, and it was easier just to get out of the house for awhile.

[Daria blushes at mention of Trent. Jane raises an eyebrow].

Jane: So, what kept you out into the wee hours of delinquency?
Is young Thomas becoming more - adventurous? Taking morgue chat
to new levels of exploration?

Daria: No. Things with Tom got kind of intense
last night, and I needed a break. Um, considering what happened and
all with him, I'm not sure I should tell you about this -

Jane: Daria, first of all, I'm over it. Tom was far from my first
boyfriend, and while it lasted it was cool, but as  boyfriends go
he was one more memory among others. Secondly, he's YOUR first boyfriend,
and you're MY best friend. When things get weird, come to me!
[beat] Unless you want to talk to strawberry-fluff across the hall
there.

Daria: [cringes] I tried that.

Jane: Wo! The sleep deprivation made you delusional!

Daria: I'm not sure I remember the babble, but remembering being there
does make me hurt.

Jane: So talk to me - what happened?

Daria: Tom told me he loved me.

Jane: Really? Should I be happy for you, or weirded out?

Daria: I am definitely weirded out.

Jane: So what did you do? What did you say?

Daria: I got up and left. We were at the Pizza King, and he told me,
and I said I had to go and left -

Jane: So what happened that kept you out last night if you weren't
with Tom?

Daria: [mumbles]Trentpickedmeup

[beat]

Jane: Did I hear you say Trent picked you up?

Daria: Um, yeah. He offered me a ride home.

Jane: And Trent giving you a ride home somehow took all night?

Daria: Well, um, no. Trent asked to hang out with me, and we ended up
sitting in the giant strawberry all night.

Jane: Trent took YOU to the giant strawberry?

Daria: Um, yeah.

Jane: My brother, who will not share that space even with me, will not
share it with Jesse, who actually made us both swear an oath never to
send anyone up there unless he remained there for over 72 hours
took YOU, Daria Morgendorffer, to the giant strawberry.

Daria: Um, yeah. He said it was kind of his special place, and that
he knew I'd need it, too. He said...um, nevermind.

Jane: You're leaving something big out.

Daria: Trent told me he loved me, too.

Jane: [raised eyebrows] OK. [beat] So the two men that you have ever
hankered after in your life both just passed on that golden phrase
in the same night, and you are here. [beat]Panicking.

Daria: Yup.

Jane: [sits on bed next to Daria] I understand that. [beat] I for one
don't think you have a problem.

Daria: Huh?

Jane: C'mon Daria - Trent knows you're with Tom. And although he will
always be menacing towards Tom because of me, Trent really thinks
he's good for you. He certainly wouldn't try to interfere in your
relationship with him.

Daria: Well, yeah, he did give me some good advice when I broke up
with him for awhile -

Jane: Exactly. My brother is not as oblivious as people assume
he is. And he DOES care about you, at least as much as I do. You've
been HIS muse just as much as you've  been MY friend. Now that you're
almost 18, Trent's probably going to want your friendship to change.
You're more to him than just his little sister's friend, you know -- and
he appreciates that you would recognize a sacred place. I love you
means something way different coming from Tom than it does from Trent,
Daria.

Daria: Actually, yeah, That does make a lot more sense.

Jane: So, shall we readjust our cynical world views?

Daria: [grabs remote, turns on television]. I could use a dose
of the medicine we call apathy.

 From Television: UNDERWATER BASKETWEAVING: COLLEGE MAJOR, OR KINKY SPORT?
  NEXT ON SICK SAD WORLD.

Act III: Scene I:

[Mr. O'Neil's classroom. Jane, Daria and Kevin are sitting in the front.
Jodie is standing at the front of the class, giving a presentation].

Jodie: And in conclusion, we have found that mass media -- particularly
events viewed at extreme length, such as sports programming and
televangelism -- provide a dangerous opportunity for influencing the
masses through subliminal messages and preying on the cognitive dissonance
caused via the illusion of popular opinion.

Daria: you mean somebody noticed?

Jane: You might want to plug your ears and not watch this next part.

Daria: huh? Why?

Jodie: and with that said, I present to you the new Lawndale high telecast.

Jane: [sotto voce] Daria, I mean it. Take these earplugs and *don't watch*

Daria grabs earplugs, puts them in. Shot to Jane and Jodie - both are
wearing earplugs and not looking at the screen.

As Daria looks around at the classroom, we see Kevin scratching at his
football jersey, other members of the classroom twitching, and Brittany
sitting very, very, still. On a second pan, Kevin is in a seizure and
has ripped his jersey off, Brittany is glaring at him and all the other
students are looking slightly ill. Mr. O'Neil is standing at the front
of the class, looking horrified.

Back to Jane, who nods to Jodie and Daria. At her motion they all
quietly leave the classroom.

Act III: Scene II: [Pizza King. Jane, Jodie and Daria are sitting
around a booth].

Jodie: I was researching subliminal messages for a project in
psychology class, and when Ms. Li came in with her edict it seemed
like a perfect place to test the material -- and to protest the
way I'm always having everyone else's need for glory dumped on me.

Daria: I admit, it was brilliant. As evil as if Jane or I thought of it.

Jodie: Thank you.

Jane: By the way, why did you test the stuff on Kevin specifically?

Jodie: It's a sort of anniversary present to Mack. If Kevin tries calling
him Mack Daddy, he'll start itching horribly again. And every time
Brittany sees a football, or something that reminds her of football,
she'll feel like she's looking at Upchuck.

[all three laugh].

[Tom walks in and approaches the girls' table]
Tom: Hi Daria!

Tom appears at end of table.
Daria: Um, hi Tom! How'd you know I was here?

Tom: I stopped by your place looking for you, and your Mom said you
might be here with Jane. She mumbled something about you being grounded
and how you should be there, but the cell phone saved either her or
you. I'm not sure which.

[looks to other two girls] Hi Jane. Jodie, it's a pleasure
to see you again.

Jodie: likewise

Jane: hey

Tom: Do you two mind if I steal Daria for a bit?

Jane: Steal away. We'll make sure her pizza meets its proper end.

Tom: Thanks.

[cut to outside Pizza King. Tom opens car door for Daria, and she
slides in. Tom walks around and sits in driver's seat].

Tom: Daria, about the other night --

Daria: I guess I should apologize. I wasn't ready for what you had to
say to me. I like you a lot, and I'm glad you're my boyfriend, but
I'm not sure I'm willing to go that far onto an emotional limb.

Tom: It's OK. I'm sorry I spooked you like that. You understand I was
just saying how I feel -- you don't have to say anything back, and I
don't expect anything from you. It's one of those things that I know
you'll have to come to in your own time.

Daria: [looking at car seat] Thanks Tom.

[they hug].


Act III: Scene III:
[front of Morgendorffer home. Tom's car appears, and Daria gets out. As
Tom pulls away, we see Trent walking on the sidewalk towards Daria].

Trent: Hey Daria.

Daria: Um, hey Trent. [blushes]

Trent: I just wanted to talk to you after the other night.

Daria: Yeah?

Trent: Just to let you know it was really cool hanging out with you,
and I'd like to do it again sometime.

Daria: thanks. I'd like that.

Trent: Cool. [starts to walk away. Pauses, turns back]. And Daria?

Daria: Yeah?

Trent: That other stuff I said?

Daria: yeah?

Trent: I meant that, too.

[closing shot on Daria's Mona Lisa smile].
