<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It, started out like any day. I woke up to find that Quinn had beaten me to the bathroom again.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria VO:I  need to move out. And soon!  Jane had told me that I could move in with her in
Boston if I can get there.  The thing is I don't want to live with Jane and Tom. I love Jane like a
sister (unlike Quinn ) and I don't want to spoil that with her. Shit!! Enough of this.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Quinn!! GET YOUR BUTT OUT OF THE BATHROOM I NEED TO GET READY
FOR SCHOOL!!!!! </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It's the not any fun trying to get around in the morning.  My first Class is at 7:50am at LCCC. It's
a 3000 level class not bad for a new high school grad. But if her Royal Pain in the Ass  doesn't
get moving I'll be late. And I don't want to miss this class.  Trent is in it. I would've never
thought that, as much as Trent slept. And seemed to be unaware of things around him that he was
going to college all that time, and in his 3<SUP>rd</SUP>  year at LCCC. Jane didn't even know he was in
college. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Quinn: Daria, I have to get ready for school too; and to day is a very important Fashion Club
meeting; so you can try to get the shower in mom and dad's room to work, or do without a
shower, cause unpopular people like you can do that. Besides you look like shit anyway. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Daria VO: This is just what I need before school.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Fine you little Twit, I'll go to class smelling like old gym socks. But you can find another
ride to school!!   Quinn: MuOMm, Daria's being mean to me!!!  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Can it Quinn Mom is gone to work already.   </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Quinn: Daaaaaaaddddd, Daria's being mean to me again!!! </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Nope gone too, he's at a meeting in Philly. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Quinn just huffed and ran into the bathroom. After a few minutes I heard the water running so I
did what any loving sister would do, I flushed the stool. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Quinn:  AHAHAHAHH!!!!!.  Screamed Quinn as the hot water hit her back. Her fashion fiend
meeting should go well with her looking like a rock lobster.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> On that note I left, and when to Jane's old house ( someone has to wake Trent) and I can always
get a shower there.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">BGM: Rock Lobster by the B-52's</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> As I pull into the drive my Jeep stalls out. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Damn there goes the mountain cabin fund.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> As I try to start the Jeep, Trent comes up and asks if I need any help.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: Yo Daria need any help?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: It doses this all the time, it just needs to cool off.  He starts to sing;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent:  Car done died, left me flat, in the driveway of life, I don't see it Daria. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria VO: Damn Doors cover bands.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> But sense the band broke up he hasn't been doing it as much.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Daria: So Trent I came by to see if you were going to class today. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: No, I have a few things to do over the next week or so. I need to go out of town and Janey
is coming with me, she just doesn't know it yet. She should be here on Tuesday. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria:   Trent what's going on and can I help. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: I don't think you can help with this Daria.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: What brought you over this morning? </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: A large metal box on wheels.  I need to take a shower if you don't mind. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: Yea go ahead, Janey left some clothes that will fit you. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: How do you know that they will fit? I ask teasingly, </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria VO: Over the last few months Trent has learned every inch of my body.  Trent starts to
cough as he tries to answer, </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent:  Just think that they will, ok. As I look at Trent he appears lost in thought,   </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Trent today is Tuesday, did she say what time she would be here. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: 5:00 or 6:00 a.m. I think. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Well Trent it's 7:00 a.m. now lets go see if she's here.  At Jane's bedroom door I knock.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria:  Jane, you in there?  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: We're sorry the door that you are knocking on is no longer in service, if you feel you have
knocked on this door in error please go away.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Dari VO: Yea, she's here I thought,  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Jane, I need to talk to you. <BR>
Jane: Ok, Daria come on in, and you to, Trent.  As we go into the room, we see Jane sitting on
her bed, looking as big as a house --a 7-8 month house.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: Whoa, Janey, this is a new look for you. No school for today, </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Jane Who, How, Why, Tom! </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: Well Daria the how is easy, so is  who. The why, well even with the pill and a condom it
happens. And yes it was Tom.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: So where is Tom at? </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: The last time I saw Tom, he was running around with a striper chick named Lola. He told
me to get lost. I stayed in the apartment until the rent was due,  then I  came home to Casa Lane. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: So he's gone??</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: The bastard left me for a G*d damn striper.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  I look at  Trent he's seething his face going red as he cracks his knuckles. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: I'll kill the little bastard for what he's done to my little sister.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Daria: Trent, don't do any thing to Tom that would only hurt you. But he can't hear me in his
rage. I go to him and try to clam him down, he just doesn't want to listen to anyone right now.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Daria: Trent, honey please don't do any thing that will hurt you or Jane, ok.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: Daria he got my little sister pregnant! I'll rip off his nuts dip them in hot sauce and feed
them to him raw!! </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Both Jane and I say eeww to the vivid mind picture of Tom dancing around without his nuts as
Trent tries to feed them to him.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: Trent, It took the two of us to get this way, I made a big mistake by living with Tom, but
we did have some good times. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent:  Yea, I can see that Jane, Very Good times!!   </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Now Trent that is no way to talk to Jane, We need to be here for her. And besides we are
doing it too, so it could've been just as easily been me that was pregnant!</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Jane: Yo amiga you and Trent finally, way to go girl. If I had known that was all it took, I</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> would 've left a long time ago. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">We both just look at Jane. As Jane gets up and takes off the fake belly she was wearing. We look
at her in shock.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: April Fools.  At this moment Tom comes out of the closet,  laughing  uneasily, looking at
Trent. I start to laugh and after a few moments Trent also starts to laugh. When it comes to Jane,
Trent can't stay mad at her. As for Tom that is another story.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: So Jane,  I guess you're not pregnant.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: Nope, but maybe some day after we get out of college, So how long have you and my
brother been playing hide the snake?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Well we have been going out for about 4months now.  On the hiding the snake, well that
is between Trent and I.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I look at my watch, and it's almost 8:00 a.m..  I think no classes today.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Well who's up for breakfast, it's on me. But first I need a shower. Hey Trent will you do
my back?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Well two hours and all the hot water later, I'm clean and ready to (  I won't say what we did in
the shower) go to breakfast. We all go and get into my Jeep ( it starts will miracles never cease. I
may get to keep my mountain cabin fund) and drive to the I-Hop. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria:  Trent, you need any help with the paper for Professor Johnson's CJ class.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: Nah I'm cool.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> I still find it hard to believe that Trent is a Criminal Justice major but he is. I'm taking the class
so I can write real life crime into my Melody Powers novels. As we drive through  Lawndale, I'm
lost in thought as Trent plays with my hair, I really love it when he plays with it. Jane and Tom
are busy in the back seat with each other, I look at Trent, he has changed in the last year the more
visible of his tattoos are gone and he only wears one earring now. The band was history after
Jesse left and Nick got married. Although Trent still plays on Deaga Street  when he can, some
times he jams with Jesse when he's in town. Other times he and I will play, I like to sing with
Trent, but I can't do it on stage. He has asked me to sing on stage with him. But I always back
out. I can't get up in front of people.  As we pull into the parking lot I see that it's not that busy, I
take that as a sign that this won't be too bad. That is until I see Brittany's car. Poor girl she had to
drop out of college after Kevin got her pregnant, the only job she could find was as a waitress.  It
may not have been so bad for her, but as she started to look pregnant, Kevin took off.  No money,
a crappy job, no child support from mister asshole. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria VO: Yea her life couldn't be better.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Every time I see her she'll try to get me to help her try to figure out what she should do.  She
needs to learn to help herself. But on the up side she does ok as a waitress. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria VO: Yea that's the job for Brittany something, in the service industry-- heavy on the
serVice. I've been told that she has taken to doing the oldest profession. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> As we seat our selves </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Brittany : Hi everyone how are you doing today, do you all know what you want. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: O' I'll have coffee and a veggie omelet, what does everyone else want? Jane?  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: That sounds good to me. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent:  Eggs and hash browns, coffee for me. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Tom:  Soda and pancakes for me.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Brittany:  Ok I'll be right back with your orders.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Jane: How you been. Jane is still looking at Brittany.  I kick her under the table. Jane just looks
at me.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Don't ask that. In  a whisper Brittany doesn't hear. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Brittany walks off to turn our orders in. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Jane, you don't want to get her started on how her life has gone, she'll go on for hours and
it's not pretty, she only works as a waitress during the day. At night she's a call girl. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: No shit, I knew that she would be able to get a job with her "head" someday.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Tom: I wonder if she has a problem with her customers rising to meet the challenge.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Droll very droll(dryly).  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: So Jane how are things going at Boston Fine Arts. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: So far so good, better if I could get a certain boyfriend to pose for me. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Tom: Hey, Jane if you didn't want to do nudes I might pose. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane:  Hey, It was in good taste. G*d, one nude picture and he's ready to runaway. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Tom:  Jane it's not the picture you painted it's what you had me doing to you and the sheep. Not
your best work honey.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: Well then I'll never paint you again.  During all this Trent has just sat their looking at his
sister.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Is every thing ok Trent?  He answer me by giving me a long deep kiss and looking into my
eyes.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: Daria, I love you so much and never want to leave you, but.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria VO: Were is he going with this.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria:  Trent some thing is going on I want you to tell me what it is.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Trent:  Well Daria two days ago I  got a call from Vincent saying that Amanda was in Costa
Rica, and was being held by rebel forces.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: WHAT why would they do that to her? She an artist.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: No, she's not Daria mom and Vincent work for the DEA, our whole family has worked for
the Feds as long as anyone can remember. After I get out of college, I'll go to work for one of the
agencies.  Jane may work for them  in the future if she doesn't become an artist, but first she
needs to  finish college.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Jane just looks at Trent, then she screams </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: WHAT!!! How did that happen? Is mom ok, have you heard any thing tell me Trent?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: Janey mom's ok for now but the government won't help get her out, so we need to go to
Central America, and try to get her out.    Daria, I had to tell you  I was going to leave for a week
or so. But this isn't how I wanted to do it.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria:  Hey you working for the Feds after you get out of college is cool with me, but right now
you don't work for them. Just how were you going to try to rescue your mother. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent:  Daria, I'm going to Costa Rica to help get my mother back, that is why I asked Jane and
Tom to come home I need help with this. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Daria: Trent, you can't go it will be too dangerous, you need years of training in this type of
op's. Do you have any experience in this kind of operations? </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: Yes Daria I have some and so dose Janey. As for Tom, well his dad sent him to Cooper's
place.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Well damn it, I'm going too, the guy I fall in love with is not going to some ratshit country
without me. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent:  Daria you can't go it's to dangerous, So it is out of the question. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Wrong Trent I'm going. We went to J. Cooper's camps for 6+years and My Dad was in
the Israel Defense Force and made us all take tactical training. When I turned 16, I had to go to
Israel for Junior Reserve Officer Training.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane and Trent:  You mean Quinn, miss fashion has self-defense training. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria Yes, this summer she is to goto Israel for their version of JROTC training. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Tom:  I didn't know you were Jewish. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Tom with a name like  Morgendorffer!  Duh! yes we're Jewish.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Tom: How dose your dad take you dating a Goyim? </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria:  Why do you think it took so long for Trent and me  to go out? We all get quite as we see
Brittany coming with our food.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Brittany: Hi again, here's your food folks, is anything wrong? You all look like bummed out or
something. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: It's nothing Brittany we're just not hungry anymore, we need to leave. So could you get
our check please.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Tom paid the bill and we left,</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Dari: Trent we need to go to my house I have something to show you all. And I'm not taking
"any" for an answer.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane and Tom: could you  drop us off at Casa Lane? </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Dari: No, this includes you too. Especially if you're  going to Central America. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent:  Dari I can't let you go, you might get hurt.  I wouldn't be able to live with that.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Dari: I know, but you need someone who has done this before.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: No, you can't"-----     </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Dari:  Trent I don't think you understood what I said about my training.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria VO:   Do I  tell him about how I spent my 16<SUP>th</SUP> birthday in the middle east, up to my butt in
sand?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Trent, I have been in live combat; have any of you?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No one speaks after I say this. I look at their faces.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: I didn't think anyone had. As we go into my house.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Trent and Tom would you  move the furniture from in front of the stair case.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I then open the gun safe under the stairs. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Trent how are you going to get to Costa Rica, did you plan to take weapons with you. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: We have access to transport but not weapons before we get in country. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Well you now have weapons, what do you know how to use?  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Tom:  I'm good with the MP-5 and Colt .45  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria:  How about you Trent? </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent:   Fn-Fal and Browning HP. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Jane; I  like the MAC-10 and AK-47.    </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria:  Well folks we have that and more. But Tom I think you need to use a 9mm and not the
.45, because we will need to get ammo in country and it will be easier if we use NATO rounds.
And that goes for you to Jane. So, pick out what you want to use and don't forget the mags.  A
few hours late and we all have what we need for this adventure into hell.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: So, Trent how good is your intel on this, and were, do we meet your dad?  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: We were to meet up with Vincent at David, Panama, and then move north on foot  into
Costa Rica. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Ok that sounds good to me.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jake: Daria, What are you doing in the Weapons Locker? And with all these people here?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria VO: Oh shit</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Dad we have a problem and Trent has asked me  to go with him to Costa Rica. To help get
his mother back. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jake: No, you can't go I won't let you. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Dad, I'm 18 now and if I want to go, well I'm going.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jake: Why did  you open the weapons locker, you know that every thing in that safe was to be
kept a secret from people outside the family? </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria:  Dad these people as you put it are my family. Jake didn't say anything.  He just looked at
me.  I could almost hear the wheels turning in his head.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria Dad, at 18 you were up to your ass in sand and blood in the '73 war. This is something that
I must do. In another two years I'll be in the Musad  as a field agent, with that  you have no
problem.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jake:  Tell me the plan.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The thing about ol' Jake is that he tries to make others think that he is a nut, but if he lets you
know him you find that he has a sharp mind and can take the eyes out of a squirrel at 500meters. 
He knows the look of fear and death. And after  he saw that we had to do this for each other he
relented  on letting us do this mission. He knew it was something we had to do. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jake:  Ok kiddo you have a plan, but is it any good? Hey were, are you three going?    Trent and
Tom and Jane stopped in their tracks, on their way to the door. Trent: Nowhere Mr.
Morgendorffer, just sitting down.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jake: Good for you, now sit everyone and tell me the plan.  We told Jake our plan and he hugs
me.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Jake: It might just work, if you had twenty or so well trained men.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Dad, I think we can do it. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jake:  Ok, I'm going to make a few calls don't go anywhere.  Then Jake leaves the room. I goto
Trent and tell him it will be ok, he takes me in his arms and holds me close. I melt into his body
as hold on to each other. Jake walks back into the room.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jake: All right I got you some more intel on the incident, your mother is being held in Campo Del
Toro by a local drug lord named "Los  Lobo" my contact tell me that she will be executed on
Monday for crimes against the People. Trent, Jane and Tom just look at Jake.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Dad did you need to tell them that. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jake:  Listen Daria this is for real, these people don't play. So they need to know what you all are
getting into, I know you know after spending time with a settlement in Israel. But your friends
may not know how bad people can be, so indulge me ok.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Yes, Dad, you are right it is something that we need to know.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jake:  Now, Daria what weapons are you going to take?   </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Well I thought we would use AK's and MP-5's as are long guns, an 870 shotgun, then
Beretta 9mm. And I was going to take an SSG97 for long range work. And night vision gear. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jake: Daria, I know that you have a good head on your shoulders, but I'd like you to take a friend
of mine with you, Here is his name and number. Call him and tell him you're my daughter. He
will be a big help in the jungle. I love you Daria, and I hope you all come back.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Tom: Whoa Mr. Morgendorffer it's not like we won't be coming back. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jake:  Damn it Tom don't you understand you may all be killed doing this!  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Dad, I think we all know what can happen if  this goes wrong, we need to get moving. Can
I have your gold card and sat phone please?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> As Tom and Trent load my Jeep, Jane and I talk. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Jane, I know you can run but can you use firearms? </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane:  That's just it Daria I'm not that good with guns. I've only been around them sense I was 14
and then only during the summer at training camp.  I'm scared that I 'll mess up and get us killed.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Well Jane, it maybe better if you stay here and let Trent and I do this. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: No I'm Going.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Ok Jane Ok you can go. Lets give Mr. Rourke a call ok. I dial his number. He picks up on
the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> ring. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">John:  John speaking, how are you doing  Jay it's been a long time. How Helen and my kids
doing? </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria (VO):(My kids????)  Mr. Rourke this is Daria Morgendorffer. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">John:   Daria, is any thing wrong with your dad or mom?  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: No sir every thing's ok with them, my dad gave me your number. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">John: Why did Jake do that?  It took me a few minutes to tell him what we had to do. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> As my dad said, he would help us but he didn't like that we had three people in this group who
hadn't seen combat, but it could be worse. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Trent: The Jeep's loaded Daria.					</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The drive to the airport was uneventful, the only fight we could get was an old DC-3 cargo. This
is where we met John Thomas Rourke to look at him he was nothing special 5'9" 185lbs. 
medium build, thinning brown hair mid forty's, nothing about him from a distance said I'm a
killer. But when he got close his cold brown eyes, had  the look of death in them. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria VO:  Here is a man who has killed many times before.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria  How were you  able to get on the same flight as  us?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">John: Why do you think this was the only flight, we planed it that way? After you called me I
called your dad and he gave me the name of Trent's dad's sight supervisor in DEA's CA
Command, Kids we have an unsanctioned  mission, if we get back you all will be given an offer
to work for NSA. Daria the Musad will want to talk to you.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: I already have an offer from them for after college Mr. Rourke. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">John: Yes Daria I know. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Our flight had its first refueling stop at NAS Pensacola. During this stop we took on extra fuel so
as not to have to land until we get to Panama. Not bad for a plane that's over 55years old. We all
take time to check our weapons and gear because once we hit the ground it's do or die time, I just
hope that there hasn't been any leaks.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: Yo amiga I really want to thank you for helping us.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Hey I would've helped you even if I wasn't going out with Trent.  You are my best friend. 
You know freakin' friends o' partner in crime.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Jane starts to say more but is interrupted buy John who tells ever one that we need to get some
sleep as we still have over 12hour of flight time to go. I go off to find Trent in the back of the
plane.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Hey Trent you've been very quiet on this trip, are you ok  lover.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Trent: I'm cool I just wish you and Janey had stayed in the states this will be very dangerous
and I don't want to lose you or her.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Well you couldn't have kept me from coming, you go in harms way ---- so do I.  Trent I
love you more that anyone in my life, and you mean more to me that my life. So you can't keep
me out of this. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent:  Daria when we come back will you marry me. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Trent, ask me again when we get back, we need clear heads for this mission. But I'll tell
you this your safe in buying the rings.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He leans over and takes me in his arms and holds me tight so tight that I can hardly breathe or is
that how he makes me feel. I do love him so. Trent kisses me, I feel the joy of love. Never have I
felt as alive as I do with Trent.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">John:   I said sleep not screw!!! Looking at Jane and Tom, it looks like all four of us had the same
idea. Sleep comes to me  quickly in Trent's arm. It seams like only minutes but John is waking us
up saying.  We're over David in five, so everybody up and check and stow gear.  We landed in
darkness. We meet up with Vincent and start our trek. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent:  Dad, do you  know any more about mom?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Vincent is a man of few words and even fewer emotions, this is the first time he has seen any of
his children in a year or so and all he does is say hi and asks how things are in Lawndale.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Trent: Daria this is my dad.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Daria (VO):  (Not very impressing) Nice to meet you, Vincent. We   move  north from the
airport. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">John:  Their force is around 50 rebels, so ladies we are vastly out numbered.  Daria I want you on
point as we move north I'll take the six. You four in the middle and no noise.   </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: Why do you want Daria to take point? That is the one who gets shot first, and I don't want
my girlfriend killed.  So I'll take point.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: No! Trent you don't have the experience. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent:  And you do? </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">John:  Trent, I wouldn't have picked Daria  if  I did think she could do it.  Ok, Trent you see, you
have had some training and a little range time. But Daria has had real combat experience, yes I
know it was in a desert warfare and not in jungle warfare. But that is all  we have to work with. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Our trek takes us north into some of the thickest jungle in Central America. As we move through
the jungle we can see that life all around us in the multitude of animals and plants, Mr. Rourke
points out a few of the more dangerous animals and insects.  I also notice that death is around
every tree and bush. An eight-foot boa is wrapped around a spider monkey, squeezing the life
from it small body.  We move slowly in this dark place, one mistake and we could all die. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: Hey, Trent would you look at that.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: Look at what Janey?  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: That slimy thing on your neck. I think you got it from the last stream we crossed.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  I hear Jane Talking to Trent and go back to him to see if I can help. That's when I see a rebel in
a tree with a rifle pointed at Tom, I whip up my MP- 5 and fire, the built in silencer reduces the
sound of my weapon going off. I fire a short 3 round bust fpht, fhpt, fpht,  hitting the rebel in the
head and neck.  He falls soundlessly from the tree. Tom dives for the ground and cover.  Tom
rolls under a fallen tree firing at the lifeless body of the man I just killed.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The report of his silenced MP-5 going off sounds like a long fart as the fallen rebels body jerks
with  the impacts of his rounds. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">John: Tom, stop firing! Your wasting  ammo!! And put that weapon on three round burst, the
man was dead with Daria's first round.  Trent, check the body.  Trent looks at the man's body,
his face going green as he touches him, Trent vomits and sits back.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: What have I gotten into? I go to Trent.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: Look at  me. Trent, move away from the body and don't look at him.  John will you check 
the body while I take Trent over here and talk to him. Vincent comes over.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Vincent: We need to keep moving, we're in rebel territory and they will be by here soon. John
checks the body for papers and any other information.  We move away from the area, stopping
about 500 meters away.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After checking the area, we have to take stock of what just happened.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">John:  Hey, Trent was that your first dead guy.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: Yea, he still looks a little green, that was my first. And it won't be my last, I still want to
go get mom.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: Trent I'm with you, this will be kill or be killed; we just have to get mom back.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Tom:  Well folk's it's a little late to back out now anyway.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: Does anyone know how to remove this leach.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Vincent:  Hey, Trent let me  get that leach off of you. And the rest of you need to check for them. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: Can these things get inside of us? </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Jane that is why you have on biker shorts, there tight enough that bugs can't get inside
your underwear.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">John: Guys there are a few bugs out here that we need to stay clear of and leaches aren't the
worst. Just be careful where you take a piss or shit ok.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> I look at Trent and Jane- </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: I hate the jungle, lets get this done. And get outa here. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">We walk on in silence for a couple of hours still moving north. We have made good time
traveling about 14 km.   </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: John, I've not got to work with night vision how long will these last? </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">John: The ones we're using should last for just more than 20 hours in continual usage.  And we
will be at the village before sunrise.    Only a few kilometers to go. Daria I'm going to take over
as point, you need to keep a sharp eye out on our rear. Vincent help her ok.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Vincent:  We should be getting close to their patrol area so stay sharp and no talking.   We move
through the jungle staying in a close group, Trent signals everyone to get down and off the trail.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> We all melt into the surrounding jungle as a squad of rebel's walk passe, we can tell this is a
routine patrol as they are talking loudly. Tom starts to shoot them as they pass but Trent stops
him. I then see why as a smaller squad comes slowly down the trail moving in a very stealthy and
deliberate manor as if they are looking for someone. Using hand signals I tell John what we've
seen and how many in the squads that past us.  We wait until John says that it is safe to move out
again, we travel about 4km when we see the village.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> John: I'm  going to check  out the village, you all don't move until I get back. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">We all pull back a little further into the jungle and wait for John to return. I go to Trent </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: We should be able to get in and out with Amanda soon. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: This may work if we can keep the element of surprise.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">John: I think that we still have that Daria, they are not on alert.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Eep ! When did you get back? </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">John:  Just now, everybody lets regroup and go over our plan. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">We move away from the trail and quietly go over our plan, </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">John: It looks like they have about 45 people in the village.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Tom:  Does that include the ones we saw on the trail? </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">John: No that would make the count around 60, so that is a little higher than we thought but I
think we can still do it.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria:  I think we should take out the two squads, then hit the village.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">John: Daria I think we will go get what we came for and leave. It will be daylight soon and I for
one want to be gone before then. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent:  Ok, lets do it.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As we move into the village I see the building that houses Trent and Jane's mom, </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria VO:  This may work .</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> While we're making our way through the streets, we see no one on the streets.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria VO: Where are all the armed troops, I don't see any out on the street?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> We make it to the house and set up the perimeter. Still, no one is out on the streets. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: This doesn't feel right. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">That is when I hear the music coming from the small bar down the  street.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> John: Tom, check that out, be careful no noise.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Tom works his way down the street staying in the shadows quietly sneaking to a point where he
can look in the bar. As we wait, I hear a muffled noise come from the house, like a choked off
scream. I motion to Jane.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Hey Jane I think I heard something from inside. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: Yea me too.  Do you want to go look ?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Yea but we need to wait for Tom to get back. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: Jane that may be mom in there. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: Yes Trent it probably is but we need to wait. That's when we all lookup to see Tom
running back towards us as fast as he could move. Tom slides to a stop going down on one knee
bring up his weapon aiming at the door of the bar. No one comes out, Tom slowly moves into the
shadows  near us.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Tom: It looks like every armed person in this village is in side of that bar getting drunk. I
counted 45 to 50 people all of them armed I thought they saw me that's why I ran back.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">John: This maybe a good thing. If that is everyone then we take them out and get out of this
rathole. Daria I want you to take the high ground, setup in that church at the end of the street that
will be our way out of the village, you can use that Romanian SSG97.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria; Yes John I can. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">John: Good now get going and stay down. You two setup on the bar, Vincent and I will get your
mother. Jane you cover the door for us.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">We all move out to our positions, I make good time to the church and setup on the roof.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria VO:  I need to get more exercise.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> As I look through my scope, I see Trent and Tom setting up on the bar, I check the back door to
the bar,  I have a clear field of fire on the back door. From my position  I can keep an eye on the
street and the door. As a last thought I put the silencer on my SSG97, I see that John and Vincent
are moving into the house, Jane is covering the door. I see the flash of their firearms going off,
then the loud chatter of and AK-47 going off. People start running out of the bar shouting about
the prisoner, I see that Trent has opened up on the rebels taking down the fist three out the door,
this stops them from coming out the front door. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I check the back door and see two looking out, the first one I take with a head shot.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The second through the chest, I see the red foam coming from his lips as he dies in the half light
of the predawn.  Tom throws a hand grenade through the window of the bar. As it goes off
people start running from the bar into the murderous fire from Trent and Tom. The ones that try
to go out the back door I take down with relentless fire.  I eject my spent magazine, and ram
home a fresh one, slamming the bolt closed I fire on any thing that comes out of the bar's back
door. It's all over in less that five minutes. The smell of cordite and blood hangs heavy in the still
air of the village, I check to see if Trent is ok. I see him keeling by Tom, helping him up it looks
like Tom got hit in the leg.  I start to count the bodies when I see two men running from the
wreckage of the bar.  Trent doesn't see them.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: TRENT LOOKOUT. I shoot the first one through the neck and as he's going down
spraying blood every where, I aim at the second man, he dives for cover  behind an old car body.
Trent sees the man just in time to take cover leaving Tom in the open, I lay down cover fire with
my MP-5 so Tom can crawl to cover with Trent. After  Tom gets to cover both Tom and Trent 
through grenades at the car. The car explodes in a fiery ball of twisted metal and bloody spray.  
Vincent, John and Amanda exit the building, Jane meets up with them and they all start down the
street towards my position, running for their lives. I look at the house they had just come out of
and I see the house explode, the four of them hit the dirt as bits of house rain down on the
village.  A 2by4 lands only inches from my head as I roll off the roof of the church and drop to
the ground. I run to where Trent and Tom are, in the distance I hear the sound of choppers
coming in. I think we may not have to walk out of here. As I thought Tom was hit in the upper
leg but it wasn't that bad. It was a flesh wound, and if we can get him out of here it will be ok. At
least he will have a story to tell when we get back to the real world.  I can now see the choppers
and yes they are America, John sees them also and pops smoke. One of the choppers comes in
over the village and spots our position as the other chopper lays down fire on the tree line. I had
forgotten about the patrols. The first chopper lands and Vincent loads Amanda and Trent helps
load Tom as the rest of us climes in the chopper we take off and clime up to 300 ft. heading back
to Panama and then home.  As I look back at the village, it grows smaller in the distance.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria VO: A lot of people lost their lives here today, I'm glad that we got out without losing
anyone. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">John: Well folks I think that as soon as we get back to the canal zone we will all need some rest. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Amanda looks at her children and hugs them saying.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Amanda: You two shouldn't have come down here to help, I don't want you to follow in mine
and Vincent's footsteps.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Vincent: Amanda, I had to ask for their help, our people weren't going to help. The DEA had
written you off as dead. So after I found out you were alive, I call in every favor that I could. I
didn't expect Trent to get down here this fast, I thought it would take him a week or more to get a
team together. I had hoped that he would use a more experienced team. One that would tell him
to stay at home.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: Dad you said get a team together now, so I did. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Amanda: Vincent, I didn't have a week. I had until Monday then I was to be executed by those
people. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Vincent:  I didn't know, that we cut it that close.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> As he hugs her close to him and kisses her. I look at Trent and Jane, my two best friends in the
world.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria (VO): (I love both of them.) Hey Jane do you want to be the maid of honor at mine and
Trent's wedding? </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: When is it?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Oh, in a few weeks, after Trent buys the rings. I look at Trent.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Well Trent you asked me before we left the states, and I didn't say yes then but I am now. 
What do you say Trent? Want to go to a wedding. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: With you any day.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: That's cool how 'bout Thursday?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Tom: Well, mosseltoff to you two now will someone look at my leg!!!</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> John moves to check Tom's leg as we all laugh at his outburst. Leave it to, Tom to change the
mood for us all.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">John: Well Tom, what do you want me to do for your leg. The bandage is holding and we'll land
in a few minutes, so what do you need? </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Tom: I need someone to hold my hand. As he looks at Jane.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: I'll do it if I can paint you again. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Tom: Ok but no sheep this time. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Vincent and Amanda just look at him as if he had lost his mind. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane laughs : No sheep this time. as she takes his hand.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: I'll use cows and chickens  instead. Tom rolls his eyes.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Tom: I need to get a new girlfriend one that's not an artist. Jane playfully hits Tom, then they
kiss.  Everyone says in one voice GET A ROOM YOU TWO!!</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: Hey Daria sense I'm your maid of honor, you can be my maid of honor.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: That would be great, I'd like that.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: Hey we can all get married in the canal zone it's US soil. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: I think we should wait until we get back to Lawndale my parents might want to be at my
wedding, don't ya think.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Door gunner: You Morgendorffer?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria:  Yes I am, what of it?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Door gunner: Your parents are at the base we are going to land at. Your dad is the one that asked
us to go in after you all.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: My dad? How did he get the US Army to come after us? </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Door gunner: Well your dad asked but your mother ordered us, you don't fuck with a  full bird
Colonel from the AG's office. Your dad could've gotten us to do it. But it would've taken longer,
I never met a staff officer in the IDF before. what is your dad, a Colonel or a General.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria VO: My dad?? I thought he was a junior officer in the IDF. But what blows my mind is my
mother the Colonel. I knew that they waited to have Quinn and I but, who would've thought both
of them in the military.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: I knew you were a twisted little crawler Morgendorffer,  but not that twisted an Army Brat.
I can't wait to see the look on Quinn's face when she learns about this;  Quinn an army brat,
that's a laugh. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Tom:  Yea, could you see her shopping at the base PX, she  would just die.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Door gunner: Daria this Quinn is she a self-centered girl about 16 or so?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Yea that sounds like Quinn to me sgt. by the way what is your name.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Door gunner: She is back at the base. Oh the names Daniel, by the way.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Thank you and everyone for coming after us.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daniel: Your welcome Daria.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Tom: So how long before we land, Daniel?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daniel: It'll be about an hour or so, Tom. By the way how's the leg doing?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Tom: Thanks, it's ok the bleeding has stopped.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daniel: Cool, now all we need to do is get this eggbeater back to base. This far north in Panama
we need to look out for the old Panamanian Defense Forces. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: I thought that they were gone after Noriega was taken out?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Vincent: No Daria, they just moved into the jungle and became drug dealers and rebels.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daniel: Hey, Daria the pilot would like you to get a headset on and talk to her. So here, just put it
over your head and speak into the microphone.   I put the headset on and I hear a voices that
sound like my Aunt Amy and my Mother.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Amy: Dusty 17 to HQ , all packages accounted for and safe, over.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">HQ: Good work Captain, can you put the Eleve on the radio. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Amy: She should have a headset by now, Eleve you there?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria (VO):( How do I answer them? Wait she called me by my cadet officer rank in the IDF.
We are still in hostel territory) Yes Captain I'm here. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Amy: Good  Eleve the Colonel would like you to meet with her and the Tat Aluf  as soon as we
hit the ground. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Yes sir I will.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria VO: My dad is a General WOW,  Morgendorffor, get a grip this is still your 'rents. But this
explains a lot of things in Israel a couple of summers ago .</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: Daria, what's wrong? You look like you just swallowed a bug or something.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: My dad is a Tat Aluf.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: Huh??</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: A what?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Tom: No shit that's cool.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daniel: Is that a IDF General?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Yea, Brigadier General </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">John: So are you going to tell them about the wedding when we land?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: Well I think we should let them know. What do you think Daria?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Yes, we will tell them after we land. How much longer until we land?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daniel: Captain says in about ten.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daira: Cool, now we just need to land this thing and find a place to get a license and a Rabbi to
marry us.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daniel: Daria, the Captain would like to speak to you.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I put the headset back on and hear Aunt Amy's voice.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Amy: Daria, you on this com yet.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Yes Aunt Amy, what did you need? 						</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Amy: We're about sixty seconds out, and I thought we should talk. Are you and Trent going to
get married? I heard something about a Rabbi, and I think you should wait until you get out of
college.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I notice that aunt Amy has put us in an orbit over the base so that she and I can keep talking.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Yes, we are planing to get married in Panama today if we can.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Amy: Have you given any thought about Trent's religious beliefs?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: No , I've not really thought about it.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Amy: You need to ask him if he wants a Temple wedding or a civil service.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daira: I will Aunt Amy, thanks I needed the help.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Amy: That's what I'm here for.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Trent, I need to know do you want a Temple wedding or a civil service?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: Draia, Jane and I are Roman Catholic. So a civil service would be the best. I don't think
we could find a Priest to marry us on such short notice.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Yea, it would be hard to find a Rabbi too. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Tom: Maybe we should all postpone the weddings until we can get the religious stuff worked
out.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jane: That maybe for the best, we need to wait until our heads are clear. The fog of war and all.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Daria: Yea that maybe the thing to do.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Trent: Ok we'll wait a little while. We need to be thinking clearly before we do it anyway.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Amy(VO): (Smart kids, Hell their not kids anymore.) Dusty 17 to HQ.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Helen: HQ go ahead.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Amy: That mission is scrubbed, I repeat that mission is scrubbed.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Helen: Thank G*d, good work Amy.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Amy: Helen, but it may still take place.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Helen: That I know, but in a few years. That I can handle, Trent's not a bad kid and I think he
will make Daria happy.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Amy: Copy that and agree with you.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The End.   </SPAN></P>
