<p>The odor of stale beer permeated the Zen’s interior, and Quinn resisted the
urge to retch on the spot. The walls were colorless with mildew and grime, and
she walked carefully to avoid the puddles of whisky and what looked like urine
on the floor. But the worst part was that there wasn’t a person with a normal
hairdo in sight.</p>
<p>Quinn frowned at the scene before her. She had come into a disgusting grunge
club (and had had the obvious regulars scrutinizing her as if <i>she</i> was the
freak) to listen to a band that she didn’t even like. And for what? So what if
she’d written a song for Mystik Spiral? She wasn’t so narcissistic that she’d
go into a gross building just to admire her handiwork. So why was she here?</p>
<p>Trent Lane.</p>
<p>As much as she hated to admit it, Trent was really her sole reason for being
there. It was his voice over the phone that had brought her to the Zen. If it
had been any other member of the band, she’d have laughed in his face. But
Trent was different. His voice over the phone had been so soothing that she’d
agreed without even thinking about it.</p>
<p>Not only that, Quinn had spent the past two days reviewing the conversations
they’d shared, and she began to realize how comfortable he made her feel. As
she watched the technicians set up the stage, she wondered just how he’d
introduce the song she wrote.</p>
<p><i>&quot;Hi, I’d like to sing a song that my friend Quinn Morgendorffer
wrote.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I’d like to sing a song that my </i>special<i> friend Quinn
Morgendorffer wrote.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I’d like to sing a song that my </i>very special <i>friend Quinn
Morgendorffer wrote.&quot;</p>
</i>
<p>Quinn shook her head. <i>God, that was stupid. You’d think I have a crush
on him or something.</p>
</i>
<p>The crowd burst into applause as Mystik Spiral took the stage, and in spite
of herself, Quinn began to join in. <i>Well, it’s polite,</i> she
rationalized. However, the applause that the rest of the crowd was giving them
was a bit more than mere courtesy. Ever since the band’s <i>Freakin’ Friends</i>
video had gotten airplay from College Television Network, more and more people
had begun to show up for their gigs. At least that was what Trent had said.</p>
<p>Quinn rolled her eyes at herself. <i>Trent, Trent, Trent. He’s just some
grungy singer! Who cares that he’s cute and dreamy and his band is on the road
to success?</p>
<p>Wait a minute! Where did </i>that <i>come from?</p>
</i>
<p>&quot;Hey. We’re Mystik Spiral, but we’re thinking of changing the
name.&quot; Quinn quickly turned her attention to Trent as he began his
introduction. What was he going to say?</p>
<p>&quot;I want to sing a song that my friend’s sister wrote for us.&quot;</p>
<p>Quinn’s jaw dropped as she felt a sinking feeling in the pit of her
stomach. <i>&quot;My friend’s sister?&quot; Is that all I am to him?</i>
Granted that she wasn’t going to hear any of the romanticized titles that she’d
just thought about, but <i>friend’s sister</i> was just so… distant. She
should have been closer to him than that, especially after all that they had
said to each other. She had told him things that she’d never told anyone. She’d
certainly felt close to him.</p>
<p><i>I don’t like Trent. He’s just some guy that my sister knows. And the
fact that Daria knows him makes him someone completely unsuitable for dating,
period.</p>
<p>So then why do I feel so cheap now? Like when David blew me off?</p>
</i>
<p>She began to listen to the music, hoping that it would drown out all of her
thought on the subject.</p>
<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p><i>&quot;This is our encore song,&quot;</i> sang Trent. <i>&quot;We’re so
sorry, but we didn’t plan it like thiiiis, yeah!&quot;</i> The song came to a
close. &quot;Thanks for coming out, but we really have to get going. We’ll see
you next time. Good night.&quot;</p>
<p>As the members of the grunge club began milling around, Tiffany headed for
the stage. She’d already forgotten why she’d come here, but that was
understandable, since the music was loud enough to jar a few thoughts loose.
Maybe talking to some of the band members would help her remember.</p>
<p>She spied one of them: A long-haired, green-eyed burly man in his early
twenties. What was his name again? Oh, yeah. <i>Jesse.</p>
</i>
<p>Tiffany went up to Jesse. &quot;Doooooooes this make me look faaaaaaat?&quot;
she asked. It was as good a way to start a conversation as any.</p>
<p>Jesse eyed her for a pair of heartbeats. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he answered.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; frowned Tiffany.</p>
<p>Jesse pointed at her dress. &quot;Blue,&quot; he observed.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; replied Tiffany.</p>
<p>&quot;Nice,&quot; complimented Jesse.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; smiled Tiffany. Then she frowned in thought. She was
doing well, but she needed something else to spur the conversation along. Then,
it came to her. &quot;Hypotherrrrrrrrmia!&quot; she cried.</p>
<p>&quot;Cool,&quot; replied Jesse.</p>
<p>&quot;Is <i>that</i> what it means?&quot; asked Tiffany.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh… yeah,&quot; replied Jesse.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow!&quot; exclaimed Tiffany in admiration. &quot;You’rrrrrrrrrrre
smart!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tiffany?&quot; Tiffany turned to see Quinn coming toward her.
&quot;What are <i>you</i> doing here?&quot;</p>
<p>Tiffany scratched her head in thought. &quot;I forgot,&quot; she replied.
&quot;Um… What are <i>you</i> doing here?&quot;</p>
<p>Quinn rubbed her chin and pretended to think. &quot;You know what? I forgot,
too,&quot; she lied glibly. &quot;I’ll tell you what. As long as we’re
forgetting stuff, why don’t we forget that we even saw each other. Okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uhhhhhhhh…&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That’s great!&quot; cried Quinn. &quot;Now, you just keep that way
for at least twenty-four hours, okay?&quot;</p>
<p>Quinn’s words finally drilled their way through Tiffany’s thick skull.
&quot;Okayyyy,&quot; she said. She turned to Jesse. &quot;Number?&quot; she
offered.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; replied Jesse.</p>
<p>&quot;That was awesome, man!&quot; cried Max as he and Trent walked up to
Quinn, Tiffany and Jesse. &quot;No one ever asked for an encore before! I’m
telling you, man, we’re going all the way! All the way!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; agreed Trent. &quot;They really liked the <i>first</i>
song, too. Right, Quinn?&quot;</p>
<p>Quinn crossed her arms and deliberately looked away from him, frowning. Trent’s
eyes widened at her. She was obviously mad at him. But why?</p>
<p>But before he could ask her what was the matter, Max jumped in. &quot;Hell
yeah! Your muse rules! She’s gonna make it happen!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That’s great, Max,&quot; Trent said to the drummer, hoping that he’d
take the hint.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey Max, we’re all set with the equipment,&quot; Nick called from the
rear entrance.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; Max acknowledged. &quot;Meet you back at the house,&quot;
he said to Trent. He walked off.</p>
<p>Jesse turned to Tiffany. &quot;Ride?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; answered Tiffany. The twosome followed Max out the exit.</p>
<p>Trent turned to Quinn. &quot;Ready to go?&quot; he asked with an appeasing
smile.</p>
<p>With a scowl on her face, Quinn stormed out of the club.</p>
<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>In the car, Quinn continued scowling.</p>
<p>&quot;So how did you like the show?&quot; asked Trent.</p>
<p>&quot;It was fine,&quot; answered Quinn curtly, deciding to devote her
attention to the passenger side mirror.</p>
<p>Trent’s eyebrows raised. &quot;You know, you’re a lot prettier when you’re
smiling.&quot;</p>
<p>Quinn turned her head to face Trent, smiling the phoniest smile she ever had.
Then she resumed her scowl.</p>
<p>Trent’s shoulders drooped. &quot;I give up,&quot; he sighed. He glanced at
his watch. &quot;Time for dinner,&quot; he remarked, getting out his candy bar.</p>
<p><i>&quot;That’s</i> you dinner?&quot; demanded Quinn as soon as she saw the
candy bar.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; replied Trent. &quot;It’s got peanuts in it,&quot; he
noted defensively.</p>
<p>&quot;So what? It’s junk food! Do you do this every time you have a
show?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Actually, I do it a bit more often than that. Usually the kitchen doesn’t
have any food in it, and this is all I can afford.&quot;</p>
<p>Quinn’s face softened slightly, but then she began frowning all the more.
&quot;Well… that’s just too bad. We’re going to Pizza King.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don’t have any money, Quinn,&quot; replied Trent. &quot;Max
collected the pay for tonight’s gig.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fine! I’ll buy, then. But like it or not, you’re getting some <i>real</i>
food!&quot; argued Quinn.</p>
<p>&quot;Pizza is <i>real</i> food?&quot; asked Trent skeptically.</p>
<p>&quot;It’s better than what you’re eating right now,&quot; retorted
Quinn.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay… <i>Mom.&quot;</p>
</i>
<p>Quinn let him have the last word as Trent began to drive toward the pizza
parlor.</p>
<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>At Pizza King, Trent finally confronted Quinn. &quot;So, why are you so mad
at me?&quot;</p>
<p>Quinn crossed her arms and looked away.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it because of how we arranged the song? We can try some different
music, if you want.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, don’t worry about the <i>song.</i> The song’s just <i>fine,&quot;</i>
said Quinn sarcastically. &quot;Especially considering that it was written by
your <i>friend’s sister.&quot;</p>
</i>
<p>&quot;Oh, that,&quot; said Trent. &quot;I’m sorry about that. It’s just
that Max was really riding me about the fact that you’re still in High School
and that you were writing a song for us. He thought that it was kind of
fishy.&quot; Trent frowned. &quot;He can be annoying like that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Assuming you’re not too oblivious to notice,&quot; remarked Quinn.</p>
<p>Trent’s laugh trailed off into a cough. &quot;Yeah. But I guess we all have
people who get on our nerves sometimes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; remarked Quinn. Then she swallowed visibly as
the door to the pizza parlor opened. &quot;And speaking of whom…&quot; she
trailed off.</p>
<p>Sandi walked in, accompanied by one of the numerously interchangeable High
School boys of Lawndale. Quinn couldn’t even remember this one’s name, but
she had the vague impression that she’d blown him off sometime last year.
&quot;Oh hello, Quinn,&quot; Sandi greeted her. &quot;I didn’t know that you
were going out with a guy tonight.&quot;</p>
<p><i>&quot;Hi</i> Sandi,&quot; said Quinn with phony cheerfulness. &quot;I wasn’t
expecting to see <i>you</i> here. I just decided to get some pizza with my um…
my date, here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I see,&quot; replied Sandi. &quot;But <i>Quinn,</i> don’t you
normally date guys who look a bit less… sickly?&quot;</p>
<p>Quinn’s eyes flashed. the game of social chess had begun. &quot;I don’t
have a problem with it,&quot; she admitted casually. &quot;He <i>is</i> a
musician, after all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh?&quot; challenged Sandi. &quot;Isn’t he a bit <i>old</i> for boy
bands? Gee Quinn, even <i>I</i> never thought you’d sink <i>this</i> low. Why,
he must be forty-eight years older than you, or something.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gee,&quot; Trent interjected abruptly. &quot;I’m really sorry that I
don’t meet your standards as Quinn’s date,&quot; he said to Sandi. His look
grew speculative, and then he cocked an eyebrow. &quot;You must have a real
crush on her to be so concerned. Maybe <i>you</i> should take her out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; cried Sandi. &quot;Wait a minute! I’m not gay! Not that
there’s anything <i>wrong</i> with that,&quot; she added quickly. &quot;But I’m
not! I’m just looking out for my friend.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe,&quot; said Trent. &quot;But maybe you <i>are,</i> and you just
don’t know it yet. One of those weird mind things.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know for a fact that I’m straight,&quot; said Sandi. She turned to
her date. &quot;Curtis, to the car, now!&quot; she commanded. As the two headed
for the door, Quinn heard Sandi mutter to him, &quot;And you’d better have a
good make-out spot.&quot;</p>
<p>Quinn began to crack up. &quot;I’ve waited two long years for someone to do
that!&quot; she cried.</p>
<p>&quot;Make her wonder if she was gay?&quot; asked Trent.</p>
<p>&quot;No, shatter that smug self-image she’s created for herself. She’s
always been such a control freak, and she usually succeeds. Watching you shake
her up like that was hilarious!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what if she really <i>is</i> gay?&quot; asked Trent.</p>
<p>Quinn shrugged. &quot;So what? I like <i>guys.&quot;</i> Suddenly her eyes
narrowed conspiratorially. &quot;Of course, she doesn’t have to know
that,&quot; she smirked. &quot;I could have her on her knees with just a smile
in her direction.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And then she’ll ask you to make out,&quot; noted Trent.</p>
<p>&quot;Then I’ll just turn her down,&quot; replied Quinn. &quot;I do it with
guys all the time. It keeps them coming back. I could have her wrapped around my
finger like my little fan club on the football team.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whoa,&quot; said Trent. &quot;Sounds like you’ve got Lawndale High
wired. Good thing <i>I</i> don’t have a crush on you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is that so?&quot; said Quinn. She stuck her lower lip out. Then she
smiled winsomely at him and began to bat her eyelashes.</p>
<p>Trent laughed. &quot;Aw, stop. It’s not like you’re not attractive or
anything. It’s just that I have someone else in mind.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You mean like a girlfriend?&quot; asked Quinn.</p>
<p>&quot;Occasionally, yeah,&quot; answered Trent. &quot;Right now she isn’t
interested.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don’t worry about it,&quot; said Quinn. &quot;You’re cute enough
that I’m sure she’ll come around.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; replied Trent. Then his eyebrows raised. &quot;So, you
think I’m cute, huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; answered Quinn. &quot;Not that I’d want to <i>date</i>
you or anything,&quot; she tittered.</p>
<p>It was about then that the pizza came.</p>
<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>&quot;…so then after I finished my solo, everyone in the audience
cheered,&quot; Quinn told Trent as he pulled up to her house. &quot;Not
applauded, <i>cheered.</i> and up until then, I hadn’t really appreciated
being the center of attention. But then I liked it so much that I’d do almost
anything for it.&quot;</p>
<p>Quinn and Trent both got out of the car and walked up to the house. &quot;So
fifth grade chorus was the start of your singing and acting career,&quot; Trent
mused.</p>
<p>&quot;And my popularity career, too,&quot; remarked Quinn. &quot;What about
you? What made you decide to be a musician?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was like the family business,&quot; said Trent.</p>
<p>&quot;Family business?&quot; repeated Quinn.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. My entire family is into the arts and crafts thing,&quot; said
Trent. &quot;My mom and Janey are both artists, and my dad’s a photographer.
My second oldest sister, Penny, is into making these hand-crafted trinkets. My
oldest sister is a stage actress, and my older brother does voice-overs. So I
guess I got it into my head that I should be doing something like what they were
doing. I really liked music, so I decided to do that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So you don’t care about the attention it brings you or anything like
that?&quot; asked Quinn.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually, I <i>do</i> care,&quot; replied Trent. &quot;I mean, when
your parents mainly ignore you for most of your childhood, it’s kind of nice
to be paid attention to.&quot; Trent paused. &quot;You know, maybe you ought to
go back to trying to act, too,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don’t know,&quot; replied Quinn. &quot;The last time I got
humiliated really bad.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, I know what that’s like. Our first gig, some moron threw a
stink-bomb on the stage mid-set just to make us get off. It was really
embarrassing. For a while, I didn’t want to go back on stage because I was
afraid it would happen again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And when you got back on again, it didn’t happen, right?&quot;
remarked Quinn.</p>
<p>Trent nodded. &quot;Exactly. This time it was cream pies. Jesse thought that
they tasted good, but the rest of us were pretty annoyed.&quot;</p>
<p>Quinn giggled at the image. &quot;At least when I was on stage they only
threw food at me. Kind of nice of them to skip the bombing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; agreed Trent. He looked directly into her eyes. &quot;But
even if you do mess up or get stink-bombed, at least you’ll be doing what you
dream. Most people don’t even get <i>that</i> far.&quot;</p>
<p>Quinn smiled at him. &quot;That sounds like good advice.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Trent. &quot;Daria said something like that to me a
couple of years back.&quot;</p>
<p>A nasty thought entered Quinn’s head. &quot;Um… Trent? That girl you’re
hung up on… it isn’t Daria, is it?&quot;</p>
<p>Trent shook his head. &quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That’s good, because she <i>does</i> have a boyfriend, you
know,&quot; replied Quinn.</p>
<p>For a while, the two of them merely stood there, looking into each other’s
eyes. Then they began to draw toward one another, as if some rope was tied
around them, pulling them closer together. Suddenly, Quinn felt Trent’s warm
hand on her cheek, and…</p>
<p>&quot;Is that you, kiddo?&quot; Jake’s voice came from a window on the
second floor of the house.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah Dad, it’s me,&quot; Quinn called to him. Her shoulders now
drooped with relief, but the frown on her face was an annoyed one. &quot;Um… I
gotta go,&quot; she said to Trent.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; replied Trent. &quot;Me too. They’ll be wondering where I’ve
been all this time.&quot; He smiled at her and began to walk away. &quot;See you
around.&quot;</p>
<p>Quinn wordlessly waved at him, and then went inside. Once there, her eyes
widened. <i>Was I just imagining things, or did I almost kiss Trent?</i> Her
stomach gave a violent jump. <i>I’d better go to bed. This day was just </i>too
<i>weird for me.</p>
</i>
<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>Trent lay asleep in his bed, engrossed in a dream.</p>
<p><i>The flowers were lilies, her favorite. The poem he’d written her was
heartfelt, yet not excessively mushy, and with just a touch of Goth. He’d get
her back, just like he always did. For a while, at least.</p>
<p>Trent pulled up to the Zen, where the Harpies were probably finishing their
afternoon set. With his weapons of love in hand, he got out of the car and went
in.</p>
<p>There she stood: The Goddess of the Guitar, Monique, was as gorgeous as any
supermodel he’d seen. Long midnight hair cascaded down her back, with her
bangs dyed red; a sunrise after night. Her eyes were twin black rhinestones, and
her skin like milk. She was beautiful.</p>
<p>&quot;Monique!&quot; Trent called, walking up to her. &quot;Here,&quot; he
said, handing her the bouquet. &quot;These are for you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I’m allergic to flowers!&quot; protested Monique.
&quot;AH-CHOO!&quot; she cried, pretending to sneeze.</p>
<p>Trent frowned. &quot;You weren’t allergic to them last week,&quot; he
noted. &quot;Come on. They’re your favorite.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;God, Trent!&quot; cried Monique. &quot;Why are you trying to make me
out to be something I’m not? I don’t like flowers, especially lilies. Do you
have to be so controlling?&quot;</p>
<p>Trent scratched his head. &quot;Gee, I could have </i>sworn<i> you like
them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? Did you have me confused with some other woman? You cheat!&quot;
she accused. &quot;I bet it was that… that </i>Jane<i> girl.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Janey’s my sister,&quot; said Trent. &quot;And I’d never cheat on
you. I love you.&quot;</p>
<p>Monique snorted. The snort turned into a chortle, which then became a
full-throated laugh. </i>&quot;Love?&quot;<i> she guffawed. &quot;Oh God, Trent,
that is so last year!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you really want to talk about ‘last year,’ talk about that </i>outfit!&quot;<i>
Quinn Morgendorffer suddenly materialized. &quot;I mean, just look at it. Even
our school goth girl doesn’t wear stuff that’s </i>that <i>dated! Not to
mention your whole </i>attitude! <i>I mean, God! Trent’s this really nice guy
who honestly loves you, and you write it off as some trend? And here everyone
calls </i>me<i> shallow!&quot;</p>
<p>She turned to Trent. &quot;Honestly, Trent, I expected a little bit better
from you than to follow some pseudo-goth poseur around like a lost puppy. I
mean, there </i>are<i> girls that actually </i>care<i> about you.&quot; Her look
softened. &quot;You wanna go get some pizza?&quot;</p>
</i>
<p>Trent sat up in his bed, cold sweat lining the sheets. What had brought <i>that</i>
on? He scratched his head in thought. &quot;No more pizza for <i>me,&quot;</i>
he decided.</p>
<p>But what had the dream meant? Trent thought about the possibilities. It <i>could</i>
mean that on some unconscious level, Trent was coming to understand that Quinn
had a crush on him, and would be jealous of Monique. No, Quinn had <i>said</i>
that she wasn’t attracted to him. Maybe it meant that Quinn just wouldn’t
like Monique if they’d met. Or maybe, subconsciously he was still mad at
Monique for blowing him off, and some part of him wanted to see her cut down to
size. Only, why use Quinn to do it? There was no reason for her to be involved
in his problems with Monique unless…</p>
<p>Unless he was attracted to her.</p>
<p><i>Naw, that can’t be it,</i> thought Trent. <i>I certainly don’t have
anything for someone that manipulative.</i> Trent snorted. <i>She’d even lead
a lesbian on if she thought it would get her somewhere, never mind that she’s
straight. She even said so herself.</p>
</i>
<p>But even as his thoughts drifted to Quinn, Trent couldn’t picture her as a
conniving, calculating little popularity brat. Every time he had talked to her
this week, she had been nothing less than sincere. And what she had done for him
so far had been completely selfless. All she really seemed to ask was for him to
be her confidant.</p>
<p><i>Of course,</i> mused Trent sourly. <i>Why not confide in me? It’s not
like I know any of her friends.</p>
</i>
<p>He dug around his bed for his lyric notebook. <i>No, I like-I </i>love <i>Monique.
And I’ll write a song to prove it.</p>
</i>
<p>On the top of the page he wrote in big, bold letters, <i>Monique.</i> Then,
after a bit of thought, he penned some lyrics. <i>She’s a raven in flight,
with her hair like night.</p>
</i>
<p>Trent smiled to himself. She’d like that. She’d always had a thing for
ravens. He continued. <i>With pale white skin…</p>
</i>
<p>He stopped. What could he do to rhyme with skin? <i>&quot;She’s not too
thin…&quot; No, that makes her sound like she’s fat. &quot;She makes me grin…&quot;
that sounds stupid. &quot;She lives in sin…&quot; Truthful, but not exactly a
nice thing to say. What else?</p>
<p>&quot;Not as cool as Quinn.&quot;</p>
</i>
<p>Trent’s eyes widened as the thought popped into his head. Then his eyes
stared at the piece of paper he’d been jotting on. Suddenly, he tore off the
sheet, crumpled it up, and tossed it on the floor. &quot;Heck with it,&quot; he
said aloud. &quot;It can wait until morning.&quot;</p>
<p>As he lay back in his bed, staring at the ceiling, he began to see a
silhouette of a girl’s face and body outlining itself in the darkness. Her
hair was long, all the way down to her waist; and he thought he could see the
girl’s lips form a winsome (if slightly mischievous) smile. Staring at the
trick of the light, thinking about both Monique and this mysterious girl in
front of him, something happened to him that had never happened to him before in
his entire life.</p>
<p>Trent couldn’t sleep.</p>
<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>Lying in her canopy bed, Quinn dreamed as she slumbered.</p>
<p><i>&quot;Um… David… I like you,&quot; said Quinn.</p>
</i>
<p>(Oh God, not this dream again, <i>thought Quinn.)</p>
<p>&quot;I like you, too,&quot; replied David, oblivious as to what Quinn was
trying to tell him.</p>
<p>&quot;No, I mean </i>like <i>like you,&quot; Quinn clarified.</p>
<p></i>(I can’t believe I told him that, <i>thought Quinn.)</p>
<p>&quot;I mean, I never thought I could </i>like<i> like someone who wasn’t
really cute, not that you’re uncute, but you know what I mean…&quot;</p>
</i>
<p>(Geez, I sound like an idiot.)</p>
<p><i>&quot;Right,&quot; said David.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we can probably squeeze three dates in before you go off to
college.&quot;</p>
</i>
<p>(As if. <i>Quinn gave a mental snort.)</p>
<p>&quot;Look, Quinn,&quot; said David, &quot;it’s really flattering, and you’re
a really nice kid, but you’re not my type.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I already told you, I don’t care what you look like,&quot; cried
Quinn.</p>
</i>
<p>(Not this part again! Wake up! Wake up, now!)</p>
<p><i>&quot;Quinn look…&quot;</p>
</i>
<p>(Too late, <i>thought Quinn, giving a mental sigh.)</p>
<p>&quot;…when I go out, it has to be with someone who has… how can I put
this? A certain amount of depth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quinn has depth.&quot; Quinn looked over her shoulder to see Trent
standing next to her.</p>
<p></i>(Trent? <i>Quinn gaped. </i>What’s he doing here?)</p>
<p><i>&quot;She was deep enough to see past your looks and give you a chance.
And then there was this song she wrote for my band. Really cool.&quot;</p>
<p>He turned to Quinn. &quot;Don’t worry Quinn,&quot; he said. &quot;I’ll
take you to Chez Pierre if you want.&quot;</p>
</i>
<p>(Okay, this is just too weird. I’m going to wake up, now.)</p>
<p>Quinn blinked as she sought to reorient herself within the darkness of her
room. <i>This is getting serious,</i> she thought. <i>Now I’m</i> dreaming <i>about
him? No way would I go out with him. He isn’t my type! He’s so grungy and
icky and… smart and deep and thoughtful… like David. A </i>lot <i>like
David. I liked David. But he didn’t like me! Why would Trent be any different?
Plus, we’d be all wrong for each other. I mean, so what if I can talk to him
about things that I can’t even tell The Fashion Club, or that we share some of
the same interests. Or that he’s so nice and gentle and… STOP!</p>
</i>
<p>She sighed. She needed help, and badly. Or at the very least, someone to talk
to. <i>I told Daria that I’d only call on my Guardian Angel in an emergency.
Well, I think this counts as an emergency.</i> &quot;Hey, are you there?&quot;
she said to the sky. &quot;I have a little problem. Don’t worry,&quot; she
added hastily. &quot;It isn’t about some pair of jeans or low-cal yogurt or
anything like that. It’s about… it’s about a guy. You see, I’m starting
to develop a crush on him. But the thing is he really isn’t my type, and the
last time I liked a guy who wasn’t my type, he blew me off. So I’m afraid to
tell him. Yeah, I know it sounds stupid. So I was wondering, if he likes me,
could you tell me? Like some sign or something? Nothing like a bolt of lightning
or whatever, but just a little signal. And if he <i>doesn’t</i> like me, could
you… I don’t know… help me get over him? I mean, I didn’t want to like
him in the first place, so it shouldn’t be that hard, should it? So could you
help me with that? Thanks.&quot;</p>
<p>Satisfied with her conversation, Quinn closed her eyes. An hour later, she
drifted back to sleep.</p>
<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>The cold weather had kept the snow from Monday morning’s snowfall firmly on
the ground during the course of the week, and Jake Morgendorffer had managed to
construct himself a crude snow fort, with a pile of well-made snowballs for
ammunition. Now all he needed to do was wait for his targets.</p>
<p>As Sam and Chris Griffin came into view, Jake allowed himself a small
chuckle. He almost couldn’t wait to pelt those two! <i>Just a little farther,
you bastards. Steady… steady… now!</p>
</i>
<p>&quot;Ha-Ha!&quot; cried Jake as he popped up on the unsuspecting duo and
pelted them each in the chest with two snowballs at once.</p>
<p>Howling a fierce battle cry, the Griffin Brothers pulled out the snowballs
that they’d been hiding in their jackets and flung them wildly.</p>
<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>&quot;S-so you really <i>aren’t…</i> you know,&quot; Stacy timidly asked
Sandi in between third and fourth period at school. &quot;I mean, not that I’d
have a problem with it if you were, but it <i>would</i> explain a lot.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That’s what everyone’s been saying,&quot; commented Tiffany.</p>
<p>&quot;No!&quot; replied Sandi angrily. &quot;That’s just what Quinn’s <i>loser</i>
date thought. And what does <i>he</i> know? Like, he didn’t even wear decent
pants!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gee Sandi, Curtis seemed pretty sure. He said you kissed like a
guy,&quot; said Stacy.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; agreed Tiffany. &quot;He was adamant.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look, I’m <i>not</i> gay, and I <i>certainly</i> don’t have a crush
on Quinn. Not that there’s anything wrong with that,&quot; she added hastily.
&quot;But I don’t. And just to prove it, I’ll kiss the next guy I see.&quot;</p>
<p>Sandi looked to her right to see a male walking around the corner. Quickly,
she ran up to him, gripped his head as if it were a bowling ball, closed her
eyes, and mashed her lips against his.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes… and stared in horror at the person who she’d just
kissed.</p>
<p>&quot;Rowr, feisty!&quot; growled Upchuck. &quot;Oh Sandi, I’ve always
known you’ve harbored a secret burning desire for me. But I never expected you
to be so… <i>forward</i> about it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh <i>absolutely,</i> Charles,&quot; said Sandi sarcastically.
&quot;Just like I have a secret burning desire to do this!&quot; With that, she
planted her knee firmly in Upchuck’s groin.</p>
<p>As Upchuck fell to the ground screaming in a high falsetto, Sandi turned to
Stacy and Tiffany. <i>&quot;Now</i> do you believe me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gee Sandi, I’m not sure,&quot; replied Stacy. &quot;I mean, kissing
him proves that you aren’t, but wouldn’t kneeing him afterward prove that
you <i>are?&quot;</p>
</i>
<p>&quot;Buuuuuuuut Stacy,&quot; said Tiffany. &quot;It’s Upchuck. Wouldn’t
it be the other way around?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; tittered Stacy. &quot;Good point.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yoo-hoo! Sandi darling!&quot; Quinn strode toward The Fashion Club,
smiling winsomely at its President.</p>
<p>Sandi paled.</p>
<p>Quinn put her arm around Sandi’s waist and gave her a small squeeze.
&quot;You know Sandi, I was thinking, wouldn’t it be nice if you and I went
shopping tonight? Just the two of us, alone with our outfits and shopping bags.
Doesn’t that sound like fun?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um… er… well,&quot; Sandi stammered. &quot;I… I gotta go!&quot;
She quickly broke free from Quinn and ran down the hall.</p>
<p>Quinn smirked to herself. <i>That was actually worth the two weeks worth of
rumors over doing that.</i> With a smile on her face, she turned to Skyler
Feldman, who was standing nearby. &quot;Hey Trent, if you aren’t doing
anything tonight, maybe <i>you</i> can take me shopping.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My name is <i>Skyler,&quot;</i> replied Skyler scathingly.</p>
<p>&quot;That’s what I meant to call you. It’s just that I have this guy…
named… Trent… on the brain.&quot; She hung her head slightly and frowned at
what she’d just said. &quot;Oh crap,&quot; she whispered.</p>
<p>&quot;In that case, why don’t you get <i>him</i> to take you out?&quot;
demanded Skyler. He stalked off.</p>
<p>From the opposite side of the hall, Daria and Jane observed the scene.</p>
<p>&quot;Well now, wasn’t <i>that</i> interesting?&quot; said Jane.</p>
<p>&quot;What? My sister displaying ambiguous homosexual tendencies?&quot; asked
Daria.</p>
<p>&quot;No, your sister using Trent’s name as a Freudian slip. While asking a
guy out, I might add,&quot; replied Jane.</p>
<p>&quot;So?&quot; said Daria defensively.</p>
<p>&quot;So, it’d be a shame to see my brother’s budding interest in Quinn
go unrequited,&quot; said Jane evenly.</p>
<p>&quot;Fat chance of that happening,&quot; said Daria. &quot;All she’s been
talking about for the past three days is Tall, Dark, and Narcoleptic.&quot; She
frowned. &quot;Oh God.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So what are we going to do about them?&quot; asked Jane.</p>
<p>&quot;What are <i>we</i> going to do?&quot; repeated Daria dubiously.
&quot;Sorry, but I make it a point never to get involved in my sister’s social
life. Short of disrupting it by humiliating her completely. You’re on your own
on this one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So then, you wouldn’t have a <i>problem</i> if Quinn started dating
Trent? Hypothetically speaking.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jane, in case you’ve forgotten, I have a boyfriend now. And even if I
didn’t, my crush on Trent is something I’ve put squarely behind me.&quot;</p>
<p>Jane shrugged. &quot;Okay. Well, even if you <i>are</i> lying, you probably
wouldn’t have anything to worry about. And relationship Quinn and Trent might
have wouldn’t last more than two days, as Quinn is a money vacuum and Trent is
perpetually broke.&quot;</p>
<p>Daria thought back to late last summer when Quinn came into her room, sobbing
over David. &quot;Oh, come on. She isn’t <i>that</i> bad.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, she couldn’t be any worse than Monique,&quot; conceded Jane.
&quot;She still doesn’t realize that I’m his sister. But I just don’t see
how Quinn could be <i>better</i> than her, either.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because I have easy access to beat the crap out of her if she breaks
his heart?&quot; remarked Daria.</p>
<p>&quot;There you go!&quot; said Jane brightly. &quot;Just remember to invite <i>me</i>
over to watch.</p>
<p>The twosome walked to class.</p>
