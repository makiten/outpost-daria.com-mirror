<div align="CENTER"><b>The Omega Cynic</b><p></div>
<div>Daria woke late, rolling over to gaze blearily at her alarm clock.  It read
11:28, far later than she usually slept on a Saturday.  She liked sleeping in,
but usually her family had other ideas. Quinn had been at a sleepover with Stacy
last night, but her parents were early risers and often noisy ones.  She
suspected they did it on purpose, out of some misguided idea that if she got out
of bed she might socialize.<p>Either they were being quiet this morning, or
she'd slept more soundly than usual.  She knew that they would want her to join
them for lunch if they knew she was up. Instead, she pulled on her glasses and
picked up the book she'd been reading before falling asleep: I am Legend, by
Richard Matheson, a short novel about the last human on Earth, beset by
vampires.  Although well written, it wasn't exactly her usual type of
literature, and she'd been careful not to mention to Jane that she was reading
it; Jane would tease her unmercifully if she knew.<p>Several hours later hunger
set in, as well as a vague concern about her parents.  It wasn't like them both
to take off for the day without mentioning it.  She rose, and wandered
downstairs looking for a note.<p>Walking across the kitchen, dirt crunched
under her feet.  Dad and his potting soil; he was continually trying to prove he
had a green thumb by bringing plants home from the store and re-potting them for
his office.  They all died, probably because he forgot to water them.<p>
Daria
put together her breakfast, mentally thanking her father for not leaving the
table covered with dirt as he usually did.  As she put the cereal bowl down, she
noticed her mother's bathrobe under the table.  It looked like her father had
been using it to sweep spilled dirt into a pile. He did have this tendency to
grab the first useful object that came to hand, rather than spend time looking
for the right one. Mom would kill him if she saw it.  She decided to be nice,
and save him some grief.<p>
Daria picked up the robe and shook the dirt out of
it, intending to take it down to the laundry room.  But when she shook it, her
mother's underwear fell out.  A literal chill ran up her spine.  She'd never
believed that expression had a physiological basis, but it did.  This was just
like that really bad movie that had been on cable last night, with people
turning to dust because of radiation.  In real life, death by radiation was slow
and painful, and left a body.  But why was her mother's clothing full of
dirt?<p>
She shook her head.  She'd been reading a horror novel all morning, and
it had her in a weird mood.  There was a perfectly rational answer for this, and
her parent's absence, even if she didn't have a clue what it was.  She dropped
the robe and walked to the phone.<p>
Two dozen rings, and either Jane or her
brother Trent should have woken up, but nobody answered.  The Lanes had never
felt in need of an answering machine, so Daria hung up the phone.  Frustrated
and worried, she hurried into the living room to turn on the TV.  Even if her
parents and best friend were acting odd, cable would be full of inane activity,
and she needed something to reassure her that the world was fine.  But it
wasn't. Most of the channels were dark, with a few running cartoons that were
probably pre-programmed to run unattended.  The 24-hour news channel just showed
an empty newsroom, with what might have been some brown dirt on the anchors
desk.  She turned the television off with a sour feeling in her stomach.<p>
She
ran up to the bathroom.  Entering, she saw her father's suit in a pile of dirt
next to the sink. She lost the little that had been left in her stomach into the
sink, and sat down hard on the floor, surprised to find she was crying.  She
hadn't cried since she was twelve.  She'd been angry, scared, bored, and just
about every other emotion, but never strong enough to bring tears.  But her
parents were gone, dead, dust.  They hadn't been the best parents by any
standard, but she loved them and they were gone.  She sat there and sobbed into
her hands for some time.<p>Eventually she rose, dusting dirt, her father, off
the shorts she wore for sleeping.  She went downstairs and returned with a paper
bag and a dustpan.  Carefully sweeping all of the dirt into the bag, she placed
her father's clothes on top of the pile.  Then she went to the kitchen and did
the same for her mother.<p>She walked out into the back yard with the two bags
and a shovel, and dug two small holes. One of her sayings, or maybe Jane had
said it first, ran through her head: shallow graves for shallow people.  But
they weren't shallow, merely self-absorbed, and who was she to call that wrong?
She continued digging, although it was hard to see the shovel through her tears.
When the holes were deep enough, she upended the bags into them, and filled them
with normal dirt.  She'd have to make some kind of marker later.<p>She looked
up at the clear, blue sky.  "God," she said, "I don't believe in you, and I
don't think my parents believed in you, although we never talked about it, so I
could be wrong.  But I don't understand any of this.  It makes no scientific
sense.  So maybe other things that make no sense are real too.  Anyway, I'm just
saying, they were good people, who never intentionally hurt anyone.  If you're
real, and there's anything to this Heaven business, you'd better take good care
of them." She lowered her head, and stood there, looking at the ground.<p>After
a long time, she walked back into the house.  She should go do the same for Jane
and Trent, and her sister, but right now she couldn't face that.  And she was
hungry.  She didn't think she could keep much down, but she made some toast and
forced herself to eat it.  It sat like a lump in her stomach.  Preparing it had
made her realize how little food was left.  She should gather food, and plan how
she was going to survive once the canned stuff ran out.  The electricity
couldn't last forever, sooner or later the generators would run out of fuel, or
wear out.  Probably soon.<p>She drove her mother's SUV down to the supermarket,
and loaded it up with things that appeared to have a long shelf life, and toilet
paper.  Starving to death would be horrible, but running out of toilet paper
seemed worse somehow.  Thinking of things biological, she visited the drugstore
across the plaza from the supermarket, and stocked up on antibiotics, cold
medicine, and other necessities.<p>As she finished loading the car, she noticed
the gun shop a few doors down.  She'd seen it before, but never paid much
attention.  Just because she hadn't seen anyone yet, didn't mean that there
weren't other survivors, who might be less than polite about acquiring supplies,
or worse. She walked in.<p>Several hours later, after reading most of the
magazines on the shelves, and a couple of books, she walked out carrying a
shotgun, and with a handgun in a shoulder holster under her jacket.  She went
back and returned dragging a large, and very heavy, carton filled with
ammunition, cleaning supplies, and several spare weapons of the same type she
carried.<p>She drove to the quarry on the edge of town, and practiced with some
targets she'd brought from the store.  At first the noise and recoil scared her,
but after a while she became used to them, and could hit the target reasonably
well if she took the time to aim the pistol.  She wasn't sure she'd have the
time in a real fight, and resolved to use the shotgun if she couldn't run
away.<p>She drove home cautiously, thinking that all the noise she'd made would
have drawn out anyone in town.  But she saw nobody.<p>At home, she stored the
supplies in a dark corner of the basement, just in case there was anyone left to
be looting.  When she was done, she looked around the empty living room, and
decided that she couldn't stand to be alone here right now.  Funny, she'd often
wished the rest of the world would go away and leave her in peace.  Well, her
wish had been granted, and she wasn't enjoying it at all. Solitude was fine, as
long as there were other people around, and wasn't that a fine thing to discover
now? She grabbed the shovel, and headed over to Stacy's house in the SUV.  It
was time to take care of her sister.<p>Once there, she made her way up to the
bedrooms, shotgun slung over one shoulder, wondering which one was Stacy's.  It
was obvious when she opened the door to the second room. It looked just like her
sister Quinn's room, only less pink.  On the floor dirt was scattered, and four
sets of clothing could be seen, but there were no neat piles; an open window had
blown the dirt all over the room.  She searched the house until she found a
vacuum, put a fresh bag in it, and returned.  In life, the four had been
inseparable; it seemed fitting that they should be buried together.<p>Tamping
the dirt down, later, she thought about her sister.  Quinn was, had been,
annoying, conceited, and an embarrassment, but she missed her terribly.  Not
with the deep grief that she felt for her parents, but with a sadness that
they'd never find out if they could be friends.  Recently, Quinn had been
showing signs of growing into a real person, and not some kind of cardboard
cutout fashion doll.  Now she'd never get to know that side of her
sister.<p>She walked out to the car, and drove slowly off.  She really wasn't
looking forward to visiting Jane's house, but they'd been best friends for
years, and she thought she owed Jane and her brother Trent a decent burial. 
Heh, Jane would have told her she was being sentimental, and then used the pile
of dirt for an art project.  She was really going to miss Jane.<p>She parked
the car in the Lane's driveway, and climbed out.  She left the shotgun on the
passenger seat: she still hadn't seen anyone, and it was awkward to carry
anything else while lugging it around.  She walked up to the door, and out of
habit knocked on it.  The door swung open, unlatched.  That was normal enough:
they never locked the door, and didn't always close it securely.  Nonetheless,
she stuck her head in, nervously, and called out.<p>"Jane... Trent...  anyone
home?"<p>Silence greeted her, and she shrugged.  Of course they weren't home,
they were dead, just like everyone else she'd ever known.  She hadn't even seen
any birds in the sky, or stray dogs.  She wondered briefly how long it would
take for the plants to die if every animal on earth was gone.  Maybe starvation
wouldn't be a problem after all; she'd die of carbon dioxide poisoning when the
plants went.  There was a thought to brighten her day.<p>She walked upstairs,
and down the hall to Jane's room.  Inside she could hear the television playing
softly, a familiar, comfortable, sound.  It made opening the door all that much
harder.  She pushed the door open, and a figure on the bed turned to
her.<p>"Jane!" she screamed, and then realized that it wasn't.<p>Charles
Ruttheimer the third, Upchuck to all who knew his lecherous nature, turned
towards her and stood up.  "Daria!  You're alive!"<p>Daria stood in the
doorway, looking at him, stunned. She'd wanted company, but not Upchuck. She
noticed he was walking through a pile of dirt topped with Jane's signature red
jacket.  He didn't seem to notice.  In fairness, it was impossible to walk
across Jane's room without stepping on something, but it still made her angry.
<p>"Upchuck, what the hell are you doing in Jane's house?" she snarled.<p>"Why
sweetness, I'm doing the same thing you are, looking for survivors," he replied,
with a smug smile.  "And I've found you!"<p>"I'm not looking for survivors, you
moron, I'm burying my friends.  One of whom you happen to be standing on right
now."<p>"Oh!" he looked down, surprised, and stepped quickly to one side. 
"That's what all the dirt around town is. I'd wondered."<p>"Charles, you can't
possibly be that stupid."<p>"Dear Daria, you called me Charles!" He
smiled.<p>"A slip of the tongue.  Now, why don't you get the hell out of here,
so I can bury my friends in peace."<p>"I'll help you."<p>"No, I don't want
your help.  This is personal.  Go loot a Victoria's Secret or something, just
stay away from me."<p>"But Daria, we're the only people left.  We need to work
together for survival."<p>"If that's what survival takes, I'd rather be dead. 
Go away, Upchuck, and don't come back."<p>"But, but...  You're the only one
left.  I've been all over town.  We're Adam and Eve.  Without us, the human race
is over."<p>"It was more a march of lemmings than a race anyway.  Good
riddance. Besides, you and me?  Not even if you really are the last man on
Earth," she snarled the last, disgust plain in her voice.<p>"Daria, you don't
mean that!" he said, with a note of desperate pleading.  "It's fate, we're meant
to be together!" He started to walk towards her, arms held out.<p>She pulled
the handgun from under her jacket.  "Stop, Charles!  I'm not kidding."<p>He
stopped.  She held the gun, aimed carefully at his face. He stood still for a
brief time.<p>"No!" he yelled.  "This can't be happening!"  He lunged forward. 
She fired.  His corpse slammed back onto Jane's pile of dirt.<p>"Damn.  Sorry
about that Jane.  Spending eternity with Upchuck's blood mixed in with you
wasn't what I'd intended."<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>Charles Ruttheimer III woke screaming, drenched in cold sweat.  He'd fallen
asleep, fully dressed, watching some science-fiction movie about radiation
killing everyone on Earth.  On the floor next to him was his photo album of
Daria, fallen open to pictures of the school trip to the paintball range.  Oh
God, what a nightmare.  Did she really see him like that?  Probably. His cheek
still smarted from where she'd slapped him in school yesterday, after telling
him she wouldn't kiss him if he were the last man on Earth.<p>He needed a
shower; a long, hot one.  And then he needed to find some way to convince Daria
he really was a nice person.  Obviously, the suave approach wasn't working.  She
was too smart to fall for an act, and he was too inept at it anyway.<p>Maybe
flowers would work.  Lots of flowers.  He staggered off to the shower, trying to
decide if she'd prefer roses, or something else.<p></div>

Well, that was a bit more depressing than
usual.  I suppose in part it reflects my sadness that the TV series has ended. 
Hopefully getting this out of my system will allow me to go back to writing the
more upbeat stories I prefer. 
			<p>
The genesis of this story is that I woke one
Saturday morning with the germ of an idea for it, and since I didn't have to get
up immediately, I lay there trying to assemble the rest of it.  Any idea was
welcome: I've been short on inspiration lately. It started out as idle
speculation, not something worth writing down, but when I realized how to end
it, I knew I had to write the actual story.  I got up and started
typing.<p>
This story owes nothing other than the title and a vague concept to
the 1971 movie The Omega Man, starring Charlton Heston.  I haven't even seen
that movie (a lack I plan to correct shortly), although I know the general plot.
But the idea of a lone, post-apocalyptic survivor has been a staple of science
fiction for years, and can probably be traced back to Robinson Crusoe, if not
some older source.  The movie itself was based on a short novel, I am Legend,
written in 1954 by Richard Matheson (which I read after writing the first draft
of this story).  Another film with a similar plot is an eighties B-movie, The
Night of the Comet, where radiation from a passing comet turns most of the
Earth's population into piles of dust, except for a pair of valley girls and a
few others.  This was the movie Upchuck had seen the night before, and it's one
that I saw on cable many years ago, so it's a probable source of
inspiration.<p>
One staple of these stories, and others like them, is that not
everyone dies, some become inhuman monsters (vampires in the original story,
flesh-eating zombies in 'Comet).  I deliberately tried to build in some suspense
along those lines with Daria's concern about other survivors being hostile, as
well as the mention of Matheson's story.  Discovering that the "threat" is
merely Upchuck may seem anticlimactic to some, but I wasn't trying to write a
horror story, so a more melodramatic climax is unnecessary.<p>
To me, the story
is really about Upchuck, for all that the majority of it revolves around Daria. 
It's his dream, and his own insecurity that turns fantasy into nightmare. It's
also a character study of Daria, or rather a slightly idealized Daria as seen
through Upchuck's perception (and is that really any different from how most of
us fans treat the woman we call Our Heroine?).  She's often wished to be alone,
in one form or another, but even as antisocial as she is, she probably wouldn't
really enjoy eternal solitude if she found it. <p>
Anyhow, maybe now I can
finish that sequel to True Cynicism that's been half written for the last three
months...<p>
