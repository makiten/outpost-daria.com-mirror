THE PLEDGE OF ALLIGENCE, DARIA STYLE

Remember the classic pledge of alligence we 
used to do in our school of old? What if I 
came up with a new pledge and set it in the
Dariaverse?

I pledge alligence to Daria Morgendorffer,
and to the united members of Mystik Sprial
and to Laaaaaaawndale High, for which it stands:
One cartoon, under MTV,
and for sarcasm and The Fashion Club for all.

OWARI (THE END)
