Daria- (Walking down the street with Jane): So you are going on tour with Trent<br>
Jane- Yep, you know you should come to.<br>
Daria- And miss the everyday hell pit, I call Lawndale. Forget it<br>
Jane- What Jake and Helen won't let you go?<br>
Daria- not in a million years<br>
<br>
{Helen and Jake in the living room}<br>
Helen- (going though the mail) Look Jake, Daria got a letter from Genovia<br>
Jake- Where the hell is Genovia?<br>
Helen- Never mind that, I think we need to tell Daria our secret.<br>
Jake- (watching the football game) Come on guys make a touchdown<br>
Helen- Jake, are you listening? We need to tell Daria our secret.<br>
Jake- (watching the game) Yes, score<br>
Helen- oh forget it<br>
(Quinn walks down stairs talking on the phone) Quinn- I told Sandi, I told Stacy that stripes wasn't her. <br>
Helen- Quinn, where is Daria?<br>
Quinn- (She put her hand over the phone) Mo-ther, I don't know. <br>
(Daria and Jane walk in.)<br>
Helen- Hi Daria, we need to talk.<br>
Jane- Bye Daria. I can tell this will be important.<br>
Daria- Bye, Jane.<br>
(Jane then walked out the door)<br>
Daria- I don't want to talk.<br>
Helen- Just sit down. You got a letter from Genovia.<br>
Daria- Where the hell is Genovia?<br>
Helen- That's not important Daria. The point is Your grandmother is coming.<br>
Daria- I don't have a grandmother in Genovia.<br>
Helen- Daria, you are adopted. You grandmother wants to tell you about your father. You see he just died.<br>
Daria- Mom, why the hell are you telling me this. I already knew I was adopted just look at my so-call family.<br>
Helen- Daria, the point I'm trying make is that you are royal. You know a princess.<br>
Daria- What? Tell my grandmother I don't to because a princess so I can be as idiotic as Quinn. Then again I can always destroy Lawndale. Let me think as good as my second choice is, I'll have to choose not to be one.  You see I became a princess then I will live in a Royal Hell Hole. <br>
Helen- Can't you tell her that , when your grandmother comes in an hour. <br>
Quinn- It is not fair Daria gets to be a princess and I don't even get that sweater I want.<br>
Helen- Quinn, remember the last sweater you bought last week. You spent tthree hundred dollars because you needed matching shoes and a scarf to go with it. <br>
(A knock then appeared at the dollar. Quinn answers it.)<br>
Grandmother- Daria, look at you.<br>
Quinn- (pointing at Daria) I'm not Daria. That's her.<br>
Grandmother- oh boy, we have a lot of work to do.<br>
Daria- I'm not going to be a princess.<br>
Grandmother- Excuse me<br>
Daria- I'm not going to be your princess.<br>
Grandmother- Oh, yes you are.<br>
Helen- Ok, this is what is going to happen Daria will go to lessons and dress like a princess, but once the ball or whatever happens she can decide.<br>
Both Daria and Grandmother said at the same time- Fine<br>
(Daria then got up and went upstairs. She got on the phone and called Jane. )<br>
Jane_ Damn, now this. I tell you when will this pain and suffering end. <br>
Daria- What else happened?<br>
Jane- the tour has been canceled because the van broke down and it cost five hundred dollars to fix.  <br>
Daria- Worst of the whole princess thing is I have to dress like a princess.<br>
Jane- Dress, You mean like wearing what Quinn wears.<br>
Daria- Afraid so.<br>
Jane- Boy, someone need to tell her that Daria Morgendorffer don't do that.  Too bad she's a queen. Otherwise I'll tell her for you.<br>
(Quinn then picks up the other end)<br>
Quinn- Daria get off the phone. I got to call Sandi back.<br>
Daria- Jane, I will kill you if you tell anyone.<br>
Jane- I have no one to tell. Except for Trent.<br>
(Daria hung up with Jane.)<br>
