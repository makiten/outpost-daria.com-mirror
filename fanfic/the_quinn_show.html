<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Summary: Inspired by &ldquo;The
Truman Show&rdquo;, as well as the IC: Hidden Nature, Quinn realizes
that her life isn't what she thought it was.
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Disclaimer: MTV owns Daria
and the assortment of characters used.


<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chapter One


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn sat at her desk, trying to finish
her math assignment so that she could get to the more important
matter of getting ready for her date.  She couldn&rsquo;t understand
why it made any difference what the cosine of something was.  She
absently turned on the radio.  Her usual station was on commercial,
so she spun the dial to find a better station.  She sorted through a
country station, some hip-hop junk, one of those oldies stations
where anything after she was born was forbidden, and settled on what
seemed to be a talk radio station.  &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m going to
listen to people talk, they might as well not be selling something.&rdquo;
 She listened as the person talked about filming something, so she
figured it was about a movie.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s probably the most
difficult to film, because there are so many tempting options.  All
the others look best in a certain light, but she&rsquo;s so special,
she looks good from practically any angle.  I mean, you could film
Quinn&rsquo;s knee and it would be adorable.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the mention of her first name, Quinn
spun to look at the radio.  Another voice came on quickly after a
mess of static.  &ldquo;Um, yes, Adrian Quinn will certainly look
amazing in her new movie.  Now back to another half-hour boy band
sweep on WTQS!&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn was puzzled.  Wasn&rsquo;t she
listening to WTQS before she started scanning?  She looked at the
dial.  No, it&rsquo;s at 103.9, where WTQS usually was.  She could
have sworn she was on 94 or so.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s weird.&rdquo;
Quinn said to nobody in particular.  It really sounded like they were
talking about her.  &ldquo;Ah well, I&rsquo;ll have to get used to
that when I get famous.&rdquo;  She got up and headed down to the
kitchen for a glass of water and some celery sticks.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As she stepped down the stairs, she
noticed a fresh bunch of flowers in a vase next to the stairs.  &ldquo;Ah,
at least Mom knows to get fresh flowers from time to time.  They
smell so nice.&rdquo;  She inhaled deeply, closing her eyes, then,
upon opening them, wrinkled her nose a bit.  &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s
a weird looking stem&hellip;&rdquo;  She trailed off as she realized
she had found a microphone in the bouquet.  She thought for a moment,
and then her eyes went wide.  She stumbled over her next words.  &ldquo;Oh,
never, um, mind, that&rsquo;s just a bud that didn&rsquo;t open.
Well, off to get that water and celery.&rdquo;  The wheels in Quinn&rsquo;s
head were turning, but she felt it best to try to look normal.  Her
nerves were steady enough by the time that she got to the
refrigerator that she barely flinched when she noticed the camera
behind Daria&rsquo;s TV dinners in the freezer.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn took her ice water and a plate of
celery sticks up to her room, took a drink of the water, and lay down
on her bed, gnawing on one of the sticks.  She started piecing
together a few of the things that hadn&rsquo;t made sense, both today
and before.  Both Daria and she had been asleep for most of the move
up from Highland, and when they woke up, they were pulling into their
new home.  Back then Daria had mentioned to her, when she thought
nobody else would hear, that she saw cameras at school and whenever
she ran into those two idiots around town.  She said she felt like
she was a walk-on for some TV show.  Quinn had laughed and told her
she was being silly, but respected her wish not to tell Mom and Dad.
Later, Quinn could have sworn her house was covered in spider webs,
and she could smell cookies baking, but she chalked it up to
exhaustion from keeping her parents from having another kid.  She
even thought she saw Santa Claus, if Santa was a blonde teenage hunk.
 Maybe that was just some guy wearing a hat.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn heard the door slam.  Quinn sat
up, jotted some words down on a piece of paper, folded it, and stuck
it into her pocket.  As Daria walked up the stairs to her room, Quinn
approached her in the hallway between their rooms.  &ldquo;Hi Daria.
Gee, thank you for your notes in history.  They really helped me get
a good grade on that test,&rdquo; she said, thrusting the paper into
Daria&rsquo;s hand.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;But, I didn&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t know how
<B>important</B> these notes were.  Well, I&rsquo;m off to get ready
for my date.  Bye!&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria watched Quinn as she went into
her room.  Daria looked at the folded note in her hands, then, as if
struck by a bolt of realization, hurried into her room with a worried
look on her face.  She opened the note partially, so that only she
could see what was written.  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a camera in the
freezer; what do I do now?&rdquo;  Daria smirked as she went over to
the window where she had a crude ashtray, ostensibly for burning
incense cones, and burned the part of the paper with writing on it.
She then walked over to her desk and wrote down a note the way she
had practiced, making sure no camera angle would get a good shot of
it.  She worried that Quinn would open it wrong and let them see it,
but she had to take the risk.  She folded the paper and walked over
to Quinn&rsquo;s door.  &ldquo;Hey, did you want next chapter&rsquo;s
notes?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Well, okay.  I guess it&rsquo;s
better than asking you for them next month.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn nonchalantly took Daria&rsquo;s
note, and went back to her primping.  When she went into her closet
to try a new outfit, she unfolded the paper and read.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Football bleachers, after
school, bring this note.  Trust nobody.&rdquo;


<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chapter Two


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn tried to look calm as she walked
towards the football stadium.  Tonight was yet another big sale at
Cashman&rsquo;s, but she had asked Sandi, Stacy, and Tiffany to go
first so that they would get the best picks available, and they had
seemed to buy the excuse.  She tried to suppress her newly-found
instinct to search all over for cameras, but she couldn&rsquo;t help
looking around every now and then to see if anyone was following her.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She approached the bleachers.  Daria
was sitting there, reading a book while the football players
practiced.  She silently sat down next to her sister.  She then
thought to pull a Waif magazine out of her backpack and thumb through
it absently.  &ldquo;So, now what?&rdquo; Quinn asked.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Now you tell me what you&rsquo;ve
seen.  Then I tell you what I&rsquo;ve figured out, and we go from
there.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Well, I was listening to the
radio, and I thought they were talking about me.  When I noticed, it
was as if the radio knob turned itself back to WTQS on the other side
of the dial.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;WTQS?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my favorite
station.  All boy bands and teen pop singers.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Of course.  That explains WTDS,
the all-angst station.  Go on.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Well, I saw the new bunch of
flowers Mom got, and one of them, um, wasn&rsquo;t a flower.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;The old mic-in-the-flowers
trick.  You mentioned a camera?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Behind your frozen dinners.  I
never saw you eating those before.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because they were
meant to block the camera.  I&rsquo;m sure I look terrible when I&rsquo;m
scrounging for food.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Daria, since when do you care
what you look like?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Since I figured out why there
are all these cameras around.  Since I realized why those two jerks
from Highland seemed to be everywhere I turned back then.  Since I
determined why Lawndale&rsquo;s Football team plays year-round; why
the same group of people always seem to end up on the same stupid
trips and activities; why Kevin and Brittany keep passing classes
despite having the IQ of those tackling dummies; why we always have
the same exact teachers for English, History, and Science; why there
are no drugs around here other than alcohol and caffeine.  Quinn,
either everybody here is even less sane than us, or we&rsquo;re on
TV.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn froze in realization.  Her mind
was processing the myriad of repercussions this would have on her
life.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Quinn, we can&rsquo;t spend too
long here or come here too often.  They haven&rsquo;t seemed to catch
on to this place, and when I come here, I just pretend to read while
I figure things out.  I&rsquo;ll let you know when this place is
safe.  Anything you want to say, I suggest you condense it down to
the next few minutes before the coach arrives.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s with the radio
stations?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria sighed.  &ldquo;WTQS.  The Quinn
Station.  Three guesses what WTDS stands for.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Oh, duh.  That time where you
said something about the Holidays staying in your room?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;I figure by then they knew I was
onto something, or maybe they were testing to see if I would break.
I just took it in stride that the personifications of like seven
holidays were in my home, and that they came from a high school on
Holiday Island to form a band. I figured it would at least be a
change of pace.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;I knew I remembered our house
filled with cobwebs.  Anyone else you think isn&rsquo;t in on the
whole show thing?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;I know Jane&rsquo;s in on it.
I&rsquo;m betting that your Fashion Club and the J&rsquo;s are in on
it too.  Jodie and Mack are in, and even if Kevin and Brittany aren&rsquo;t
in on it, they aren&rsquo;t going to be much help.  The adults are
right out.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure we&rsquo;re on our own.  In fact, I
was starting to wonder if you were in on it, but I remembered that I
told you those things in Highland, and you kept your promise not to
tell anyone.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;This does explain why the J&rsquo;s
are still going after me after how little I&rsquo;ve given to them.
Why Sandi&rsquo;s always trying to goad me into a reaction.  Why
Stacy&rsquo;s always taking my side and never stands up for herself.
Why Tiffany talks like a stoner, when she was fairly normal when I
met her.  So, what are you doing about it?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve done what I can
to hide what I know, but I&rsquo;m sure they have an inkling that I&rsquo;m
aware of the whole deal.  I&rsquo;m just riding it out to see where
it goes.  If this means that I&rsquo;ll end up a celebrity, maybe I
can turn it into a successful business or at least a lawsuit.
Overall, I guess this is a better life than growing up on the
streets, or to a welfare mother-of-twelve, or staying in Highland
forever. There are just two things that worry me.&rdquo;  Daria
motioned at the football coach coming onto the field, and started
packing up.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Quinn
asked, gathering up her backpack.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;When does this end and what
happens to us when it does?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn had no answers, and a part of her
wasn&rsquo;t sure she wanted to know what the answers were.


<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chapter Three


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The days passed quickly as Quinn wound
down her junior year.  She had gotten a job after her parents noticed
a larger-than-usual credit card bill, &ldquo;just happened&rdquo; to
meet a cool friend with a definite drinking problem, then left the
job after she had made enough to pay off the bill and have a little
left over to go somewhere if she needed.  Daria was graduating,
second in the class behind Jodie, big surprise there, and Quinn had
been called to a conference with Daria that night at the bleachers.
She told her to pack a backpack with a few essentials.  Quinn was as
nervous at this point as she was back when she found the microphone.
Daria had mentioned going through a few dry runs for escape, but this
was the first time she had called for a test.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn packed a couple changes of
clothes, her toiletries, her cash stash, and a couple sandwiches she
made last night.  She felt it was best to keep a couple extra on
hand, in case it turned out her money was no good on the outside.
She threw the bag on her back, and walked out the front door.  Her
parents were nowhere to be seen, which made it easy to slip out.  She
figured they were off doing whatever it was they did when Quinn and
Daria weren&rsquo;t there.  She walked towards school, but when she
passed by Jane&rsquo;s house, she heard someone calling her name.
She looked around, and saw Daria next to a hedge just before Jane&rsquo;s
house.  Jane was there too, her hands tied and a gag over her mouth.
Quinn wandered around to Daria&rsquo;s area, and then ducked down to
talk with Daria and Jane.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Something tells me the news is
not good.&rdquo; Quinn whispered, as she let her eyes go wide at the
sight before her.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Quinn, it&rsquo;s over,&rdquo;
Daria replied.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Over?  Now?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Yes.  My graduation speech was
the big ending for the series.  Some of the people have already left
for whatever their headquarters is.  I&rsquo;m sure you noticed the
lack of J&rsquo;s around you.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;I wondered where Joey and Jeffy
were.  Jamie was still there, but he seemed more nervous than usual.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Quinn, we need to move fast.  I
saw things happening, and I decided to put the question to Jane.  She
denied everything at first, but a little torture did the job.&rdquo;
Daria loosened Jane&rsquo;s gag.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Torture?&rdquo; Quinn asked.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;What can I say?  She knows where
I&rsquo;m ticklish,&rdquo; Jane replied, then sighed.  &ldquo;I might
as well tell you too.  This place is getting packed up.  I was just
getting my paintings packed away when Daria burst in.  She wasn&rsquo;t
supposed to be over until tomorrow, and by then it&rsquo;d be done
with.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;The move?&rdquo;  Quinn asked,
hopefully.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;And us,&rdquo; Daria replied.
&ldquo;Their plans were to tell the outside world some story about us
moving on with our lives, while they kept us locked down.  Eventually
we&rsquo;d be &lsquo;eliminated&rsquo;, while all the actors would go
back to normal lives.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Well, something tells me that my
normal life isn&rsquo;t happening,&rdquo; Jane replied.  &ldquo;The
powers that be will not be happy with me, whoever they are.  I just
hope I can get out of here alive.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Wait, wouldn&rsquo;t your
parents report you if you didn&rsquo;t come back?&rdquo; Quinn asked.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an orphan; so&rsquo;s
Trent.  They wanted it for realism since we would practically be
living on our own.  Also, since I&rsquo;m not technically a ward of
the state anymore, it would be easy to &lsquo;lose&rsquo; me in the
shuffle.  At the very least, I&rsquo;ve probably breached my contract
royally and will probably come out of this with jack squat.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria was taken aback by this.  &ldquo;Jane,
I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane interrupted her.  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
start Morgendorffer.  I felt terrible keeping this from you.  I felt
like Judas taking the money while who knows what happened to you.  I
probably would have come over and told you tonight if you hadn&rsquo;t
beaten me to the punch.  Now I don&rsquo;t even have to make the walk
and try to talk myself out of it.  I&rsquo;ll just sit back and await
my fate.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn spoke up.  &ldquo;Why not come
with us?  You said they might do to you what they were going to do to
us.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane sighed.  &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.
I&rsquo;ve been implanted with an RFID tag.  Legally they can&rsquo;t
force anyone to be tagged, but it was part of my contract.  Your
clothing has been tagged, but you have not.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria untied her friend.  &ldquo;Jane,
if our clothing has been tagged, what chance do we stand of getting
out of here?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane got to her feet.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll
be a lot better when you change into my clothes.  I&rsquo;m tagged,
so my clothes don&rsquo;t need to be.  The people running this were
looking to cut any costs they could.  I think it&rsquo;s airing on
cable.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The trio walked into the house, and
into Jane&rsquo;s bedroom.  Jane pulled out a set of clothes
identical to hers, as well as a set of track pants with a hooded
sweatshirt.  Whispering, she said, &ldquo;Quinn, you take my
cold-weather running getup.  They never did have me use it.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Ewww, you want me to wear that?&rdquo;
 Quinn asked in as low a tone as she could manage.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria shot her a look to kill.  &ldquo;If
you&rsquo;re wearing something fashionable and bright, it&rsquo;ll be
that much easier to spot you, now won&rsquo;t it?  Besides, you need
something to obscure your bright red hair.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn gulped, and laughed nervously.
&ldquo;Oh yeah, I forgot.  It&rsquo;s going to be hard to be
incognito.  I&rsquo;ve been trying to be seen since I was little.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane smiled as she whispered.  &ldquo;I
think that&rsquo;s part of what drove them to move you guys to your
own show.  Daria was always the star, but you were a perfect foil for
her anti-social tendencies.  Plus, you helped cover the male demo
they pursued.  You two change in the bathroom, and, uh, when you&rsquo;re
done, just slip out the bathroom window.  They don&rsquo;t film
anything too risqu&eacute; since it&rsquo;s aimed at teens, and
filming your naughty bits could land them in deep trouble while
you&rsquo;re underage.  I took the screen out yesterday in case of
such an eventuality.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria looked at Jane stunned.  &ldquo;So,
this is it?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane smiled.  &ldquo;Yep, you&rsquo;re
on your way to Raft.  I envy you, but I&rsquo;ll be up at BFAC soon.&rdquo;
 She hugged Daria and whispered &ldquo;Microphones everywhere, get a
move on.&rdquo;  She then said, &ldquo;Well, you two should be
getting home soon, so see ya tomorrow!&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn waved to Jane and ran off.  Daria
gave Jane a worried look, which Jane returned with a touch of
anxiety, before Daria joined her sister.  Daria and Quinn quickly
swapped clothes, dug all their stored clothes out of their bags, and
then hoisted themselves out of the window and into the Lane&rsquo;s
back yard.  They started walking back to their house, and then made a
turn for a side street; one they hadn&rsquo;t gone down before and
figured they wouldn&rsquo;t go down again.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trent watched as Daria and Quinn turned
away from their home.  He held his hand to his ear and spoke in his
normal, gravelly voice.  &ldquo;Sir, it&rsquo;s Trent.  I think we
have a problem.&rdquo;


<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chapter Four


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria and Quinn continued walking in
silence down the sidewalk until Quinn started to talk.  &ldquo;Daria,
why are we walking?  Why don&rsquo;t we run or find a car or
something faster?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria spoke.  &ldquo;We may need our
strength to run later.  You don&rsquo;t want them to find us tired
out.  As for a car, all the cars these days have tracking systems in
case of an accident.  I figure it&rsquo;d be a small matter to hook
up these powers-that-be to every car in town.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;I suppose.  I just feel like
we&rsquo;re out in broad daylight.  I mean, it&rsquo;s night time and
the streetlights are out, but one car goes past and we&rsquo;re
caught.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we dive for
cover at the first sound of a car.  How are you holding up?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Okay I guess.  I kinda knew this
day was coming, but I expected to have more than my toiletry kit,
some money, and a couple sandwiches with me.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Yeah.  I&rsquo;m sorry about
yelling at you back there about the clothes.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry.  We&rsquo;re
both on edge, and I&rsquo;m sure if I thought something you were
doing would risk us getting caught, I&rsquo;d let you know too.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;I know.  Do you remember when I
almost crashed the car a while back?  I decided to go to Tom&rsquo;s
house, even though it was fairly obvious they didn&rsquo;t want me to
go.  I was so distraught, I decided to get out, and that was the only
place I knew to run off to.  I called Tom&rsquo;s mom to let her know
I was coming.  After that, the rain got bad, the cars backed up, and
then I almost got killed in that big pileup.  I knew then that they
would keep me from going anywhere, even if they had to resort
to&hellip;drastic measures.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn winced at the thought, then
sighed.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how we&rsquo;re getting out of
here.  If they can set up a traffic accident, how do we know if
anything&rsquo;s safe?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;We really don&rsquo;t, but I
know somewhere we can at least sit for a while.  When I recovered
from the accident, I told Jane to meet me at a diner.  Since they
haven&rsquo;t used the diner since, I imagine that they&rsquo;ve
either stripped it down or left it sit.  There should be a few
corners without microphones at least where we can talk this over.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Daria, thank you for believing
in me.  I know I&rsquo;ve made your life hell at times, but you were
still able to trust me enough to take me with you.  I know you&rsquo;re
my sister&hellip;well, actually, I guess we don&rsquo;t know that
right now.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Maybe not, but even if we don&rsquo;t
share DNA, I&rsquo;d be proud to call you sister anyway.  I&rsquo;ve
done my share to make your life hell too.  That&rsquo;s what sisters
do.  To be honest, even though you didn&rsquo;t tell anyone what I
told you back in Highland, I still thought you might be one of
&lsquo;them&rsquo;.  When I got that note, I was happy that for once
I wasn&rsquo;t alone.  With both of us together, I know we&rsquo;ll
make it.  Just remember, DTA: Don&rsquo;t Trust Anyone.  The people
we knew and others we never met will probably be coming after us in
the next few hours once our &lsquo;parents&rsquo; report us missing.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;I know, DTA.  We&rsquo;re on our
own now, and we have to make it out of here. I&rsquo;m not even sure
that anyone knows we&rsquo;re real people or not.  It might be a
selling point to have real people on the show, but if they just
figure we&rsquo;re actors too, we&rsquo;ll just be two more actors
who never went anywhere after their big break.  They&rsquo;ll
probably even do some &lsquo;Where Are They Now&rsquo; assuming they
can get people to take our places.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been 5 years since
Daria, so why&rsquo;s the misery chick the maitre&rsquo;d at this
fancy restaurant?  Angst on the half-shell: next on Sick Sad World!&rdquo;
 Both laughed at that.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From a television control room, a man
also laughed.  His features were obscured by shadow, and his voice
was familiar, but not immediately recognizable.  &ldquo;Oh Daria,
Quinn, if only we could afford to air this little conversation.
Sadly, it will have to be for our ears only, as you have been
cancelled, or at least, you soon will be.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a radio transmission came
through on a nearby walkie-talkie.  &ldquo;Sir, Trent Lane has called
in that the Morgendorffer girls have left their normal path home and
are headed towards parts unknown.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The shadowy figure picked up the radio.
 &ldquo;Thank you, Johnson.  I trust you told him to stand pat for
now.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Yes sir, and I have contacted
Helen and Jake that Daria and Quinn will be a bit late tonight, as
you asked.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Excellent.  This situation
should take care of itself, but if it does not, make sure the backup
squad is on their toes.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Yes sir.  Over and out.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The man put away his walkie-talkie and
clasped his hands together.  &ldquo;Everything is going according to
plan.&rdquo;


<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chapter Five


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria and Quinn made their way to the
roadside diner after about a half-hour walk.  Thankfully, only one
car had passed them during their trip, and they were able to duck
behind a brick wall being used to fence in a yard.  The diner was
empty, as predicted, and only a handful of lights were on inside.
After creeping up to it and ensuring nobody was there, they entered
the building through the back door, which had a wooden wedge holding
it open.  Quinn mused that they must have left this place in a hurry.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria walked inside first, and after a
cursory check, waved Quinn in.  Daria went over to the refrigerator
and, finding it barren, said &ldquo;Like I figured, they only brought
enough food for the day&rsquo;s shooting.  At least there&rsquo;s
coffee to brew.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn perked up at that.  &ldquo;Coffee,
thank God.  I don&rsquo;t care about puffy eyes now, and I&rsquo;m
going to need to stay alert if we&rsquo;re going to make it out.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria started working on the coffee,
while Quinn checked out a few cabinets for anything useful.  Short of
a box of saltines, the few things remaining were either too big to
carry with them or useless to bring.  Quinn did find two canteens on
one of the tables, and rinsed and filled both before sitting down.
Daria brought a tray with both cups.  Quinn looked at the tray and
stood.  &ldquo;Thanks.  You know, we may not have another moment to
stop, so I just want to say I&rsquo;m honored to be with you on this
journey.&rdquo;  With that, she hugged her sister.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria hugged Quinn back, a smile on her
face from this show of emotion.  &ldquo;If you had told me last year
that you&rsquo;d be hugging me in a public place, I would never have
believed it.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;If you had told me last year
that we were on TV, I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed that.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;All right, now let&rsquo;s go
over our plans for the next leg.&rdquo;  Both girls sat down and
started drinking their coffee while Daria pulled out a map.  &ldquo;Now,
going north of here is where they stopped me, but if they don&rsquo;t
know we&rsquo;re there, we might be able to get there without a
roadblock.  Alternately, heading east might be riskier, but there are
no roads for them to follow us on.  West and South will head back
into town, so they&rsquo;re right out.  What do you think?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn took another sip of coffee.  &ldquo;I
think this coffee isn&rsquo;t working.  I&rsquo;m half a cup down and
I&rsquo;m more tired than when I started.&rdquo;  Quinn tried to set
down her cup, and ended up spilling it over the map.  Her eyes
drooped as her face fell into her hands.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Quinn?  Wake up, Quinn!&rdquo;
Daria shouted.  Quinn tried to stand up, but in the process fell flat
on her face.  Daria stood over her sister looking concerned, then
reached into her backpack and pulled out a walkie-talkie.  &ldquo;She
took the bait, just like you said.  Get here when you can.  She&rsquo;s
not going anywhere.&rdquo;  Daria started walking over to the coffee
pot to pour another cup.  As she reached the bar where she had left
the coffee, she felt the room start to spin.  &ldquo;Whoa,&rdquo; she
managed to say.  She couldn&rsquo;t walk, and standing was becoming
impossible.  Had they poisoned the coffee itself as a precaution?


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Oh, Daria, the old
poison-the-coffee trick?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria turned to Quinn, who had gotten
back onto her knees and was standing up.  Daria tried to speak, but
couldn&rsquo;t say a word.  Quinn must have switched the cups while
they were hugging.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;You said it yourself, &lsquo;DTA:
Don&rsquo;t Trust Anyone&rsquo;.  Why would the bleachers be safe
only until the coach came out?  If they were going to kill us, why
would Jane divulge the information after a round of tickle torture
when they could kill her too?  Why did we only see one car on the way
here, when if we were really off the reservation, they&rsquo;d be
hunting us down in droves?  Why would this diner be abandoned, but
the door wedged open and the electricity and water running?&rdquo;
Quinn crossed to her &lsquo;sister&rsquo; who was now writhing on the
floor, trying to maintain consciousness and losing.  &ldquo;Daria, or
whatever your name is, I had to test you.  If you would have tried to
wake me up or even left me here, you would have passed, but this is
one test you flunked miserably.  Now I really am an only child.&rdquo;
 Quinn sighed as she ran her fingers through Daria&rsquo;s hair.  &ldquo;I
hope you were just told to knock me out, but if not, may God have
mercy on your soul.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn rifled through Daria&rsquo;s
backpack.  She grabbed the canteen she had given Daria and left the
other things &ndash; books, walkie-talkie, even Daria&rsquo;s
sandwiches in case those were poisoned too &ndash; in the pack.
Quinn grabbed her pack and a mop that was lying around.  She removed
the mop head and headed out of the diner.  North was the best way to
go.  If she got nabbed on the road, she might be dead, but if some
wild animal nabbed her in the woods, there would be no question about
it.  She looked back at the diner when she was about 100 yards away.
She felt tears coming over Daria&rsquo;s betrayal, but she stopped
them quickly.  There would be plenty of time to cry when this was
over.


<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chapter Six


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three matching minibikes and three ATVs
rode up to the diner.  The bike riders took off their helmets,
revealing Joey, Jeffy, and Jamie.  The ATV riders also removed their
headgear, proving that they were Sandi, Stacy, and Tiffany.  They
cautiously walked in, and as they feared, Daria was lying on the
ground, alive but unconscious, and Quinn was nowhere to be seen.
Stacy radioed in, her normally sweet voice uncharacteristically
tinged with anger.  &ldquo;Stacy here, sir.  Daria&rsquo;s out and
Quinn&rsquo;s gone.  I knew we couldn&rsquo;t trust her.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the other end, a familiar voice
responded.  &ldquo;Patience, Stacy.  Daria did what she needed to.
Quinn&rsquo;s in the running clothes, and she took off from the
diner.  If Daria had gotten Quinn, it would just be an added bonus.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe she was
able to trick Daria like that.&rdquo;  Sandi said to nobody in
particular.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Yeah, who knew she could
outsmart the brain?&rdquo;  Tiffany added.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy glared at her two female cohorts.
 &ldquo;Unlike you two,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;I actually read
those Melody Powers stories she wrote.  None of that crap would make
any sense in a real-life situation.  Sure, she could pass through a
real high school with straight A&rsquo;s, but I trust her operational
judgment about as far as I could throw her.&rdquo;  Stacy clicked the
button on her radio.  &ldquo;Awaiting orders, sir.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;As we planned, the ATV&rsquo;s
will fan out along the east pathway, while the bikes can take the
northern road.  Remember, I want her alive if possible.  I won&rsquo;t
hold you responsible if lethal force is necessary, but if there&rsquo;s
any chance to get her alive, do so.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Understood, sir.  Stacy out.&rdquo;
 Stacy turned to her five cohorts.  She forced herself not to roll
her eyes at the three J&rsquo;s roughhousing while Sandi and Tiffany
were working on their makeup.  She knew that she was cast as the
cowardly follower as a punishment, and that having to lead this group
of Hollywood rejects was part of the job.  However, she would have
had more trust in her superiors if it had been the other way around.
&ldquo;All right, knock it off, losers.  We have to find Quinn, and
find her alive.  We&rsquo;ll take the woods, and you three take the
highway.  If any of you spot her, radio in before you pursue.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll knock her out for
you, Stacy!&rdquo; said Joey.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tie her up with my
bolo!&rdquo; countered Jeffy.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;I can pick her up from my bike!&rdquo;
added Jamie.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Just get her!  We get her and we
can finally go home.  Remember, alive!&rdquo;  Stacy rolled her eyes
when she knew nobody was watching.  Three idiots trying to top
themselves for her, a drugged out waif and a complete bitch that
still believed she <B>was</B> Sandi Griffin.  Stacy Rowe&rsquo;s
Zeroes, and not a brain cell among them.  She considered trading
vehicles with the J&rsquo;s, but she knew the ATV&rsquo;s could
outrun their little bikes any day, and that Quinn would probably take
the woods.  After all, if she was smart enough to see through Daria,
she probably believed that nobody would expect her to go through the
woods, priss that she was.  &ldquo;Quinn,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;you
better hope we&rsquo;re not alone when I find you.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back in the control room, the shadowy
figure watched the two posse&rsquo;s fan out.  &ldquo;Ah, Stacy, do
you actually think she was dumb enough to go through a path in the
woods, or did you think she was trying to guess what we&rsquo;d
think?  For your sake, I&rsquo;ll assume the latter.  It looks like
the boys get first crack at her after all.  I hope they at least
remember to radio for backup.&rdquo;  He pushed a button on the
console, and a fortified gate appeared on the screen, guarded by
about 15 men in fatigues, each carrying a weapon of some sort.
&ldquo;Good, my backups are in place.  If the J&rsquo;s and the Club
don&rsquo;t catch her, the riot squad will have her.&rdquo;  He
reached again for the walkie-talkie.  &ldquo;Everything ready,
Jordan?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A man on the monitor looked up towards
the camera.  &ldquo;Yes sir.  All weapons are live with non-lethal
force.  If she makes it here, she&rsquo;ll go no further.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Excellent.  I don&rsquo;t want
her killed that close to freedom.  If someone outside sees what
happens, it&rsquo;ll be hard enough to suppress it as it is.  Letting
civilians witness her death might implode the whole operation.  She
could be there within the hour, so be ready.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Thank you, sir.  Over and out.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The figure set down his walkie-talkie
and lounged in his chair.  Leaning back, his mouth was illuminated,
and a smile was on his lips.  &ldquo;Well played, Quinn, but the next
move is mine.&rdquo;  He then frowned.  &ldquo;Ugh, no wonder the
critics thought I wasn't believable.  I really should have let the
writers script my lines.&rdquo;


<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chapter Seven


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn had chosen to walk the trench
alongside the road.  The ground was firm, and it offered at least a
bit of cover should something happen.  The sky was quite dark now,
and she had been up since 8 AM that day.  She was tired, but she knew
she needed to traverse more ground before she could rest.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She thought back to simpler times.  She
wished she could talk to Stacy about all this, if Stacy wasn&rsquo;t
on their side.  Tiffany would listen, and occasionally understand
what she was saying.  Sandi might cut her off, but at least she could
think critically about the situation.  Hell, even Joey, Jeffy, and
Jamie would get her a soda and make her feel wanted.  Wanted.  Quinn
shuddered at that word.  She already was wanted, and so many people
would be after her.  She could swear she heard their engines in the
distance getting louder.  Wait a minute; she did hear engines getting
louder!


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn turned around, and saw three
minibikes coming her way from about half a mile back.  She ducked
down into the trench and watched them approach.  They didn&rsquo;t
slow down any, so she assumed they didn&rsquo;t see her.  She looked
at the mop handle in her hand and got an idea.  As the bikes got
closer, she moved into position.  Just before the bikes passed she
threw it like a javelin towards the bikes.  It slammed right into the
near biker&rsquo;s midsection, causing him to turn into the other
two, and all three tangled together as they skidded to a stop.  Joey
and Jamie stood up and removed their helmets, while the third rider
lay motionless.  Jamie looked towards the fallen rider while Joey
looked around to determine what had happened.  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all
right.  He doesn&rsquo;t seem to have broken anything, but he&rsquo;s
out cold.&rdquo;  Jamie called out.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Good, this job&rsquo;s not worth
dying over.  Oof!&rdquo;  Joey was cut off by a blow to the head from
what was left of the mop handle.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;My feelings exactly,&rdquo;
Quinn said, twirling her weapon and shooting a glance at Jamie.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Quinn!  Um, thank heaven we
found you!  Can I get you a soda?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even think about it,
Romeo.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jamie!  That&rsquo;s
not even close!&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo;  Quinn crossed
over to where Jamie was standing.  &ldquo;We can do this the easy way
or the hard way.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Um, what&rsquo;s the easy way?&rdquo;
 Jamie replied, as Quinn took the opportunity to bring the mop handle
down on his head.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have liked
the hard way.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn leaned over the Jeffy&rsquo;s
body and made sure that Jamie&rsquo;s assessment was correct, which
thankfully it was.  As she looked him over, she heard a familiar
voice, and saw a small radio in Jeffy&rsquo;s pocket.  &ldquo;Joey,
Jeffy, Jamie, come in!  Is anyone home, you morons?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn smiled and picked up the radio,
as well as the microphone from his headset.  Pushing the only button
on the radio, she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Stacy, but Three J&rsquo;s
Thug Service is closed for the night.  If you&rsquo;d like to leave a
message, simply wait for the crunch.&rdquo;  She then placed the
microphone on the ground, held the talk button down, and crushed the
microphone with her makeshift staff.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy, Sandi, and Tiffany, who
thankfully had been stopped at the time, grabbed at their ears and
pulled their helmets off, the squeal of the dying radio still ringing
in the implanted headsets.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Ooh, that bitch!&rdquo; Stacy
yelled.  &ldquo;We need to get back to the road pronto.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;But, what if she went by the
trail?&rdquo; Tiffany asked.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy was about to respond, but Sandi
beat her to the punch.  &ldquo;Tiffany, if she went this way, we
would have bumped into her, not the J&rsquo;s.  Besides, we need to
get out of this wilderness.  My designer windbreaker is getting full
of pine needles and mud, and I&rsquo;ll never get these stains out.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy was ready to explode.  &ldquo;Stop,
Sandi; just stop.  I&rsquo;m sick of this.  It&rsquo;s always &lsquo;what
about my clothes&rsquo; and &lsquo;why would I wear that&rsquo; and
&lsquo;I should be the leader since I&rsquo;m the President&rsquo;.
You couldn&rsquo;t lead us out of a paper bag if you had a map!  And
Tiffany, since you decided to take your payment for the series by the
dime bag, have you had one coherent thought?  When we get out of
here, I don&rsquo;t want to see either of you again for as long as I
live.  Not on TV, not on a billboard, and definitely not in person.
Now let&rsquo;s get Quinn so that I can get away from both of you!&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy shoved her helmet on and revved
her ATV angrily.  Sandi and Tiffany knew better than to talk back
when Stacy got like this.  They followed their orders, and joined
Stacy on the trail back.  Sandi wished she could have just one more
day of pretending that Stacy was under her thumb.  She hoped that
Stacy wasn&rsquo;t really threatening her future acting and modeling
career.  Tiffany just wanted to go home and eat.  Getting off the
show meant she didn&rsquo;t have to deny herself the munchies trying
to stay thin.


<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chapter Eight


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn walked away from the tangled
minibikes.  She tried to salvage even one of them for herself, but
Jeffy&rsquo;s was too mangled to ride, and the other two were wedged
together so tightly she couldn&rsquo;t break them apart.  She
continued on foot, leaving the bikes strung across the road, hoping
that at least they could slow down her next pursuers.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had gotten about another third of a
mile down the road, when she heard engines coming her way.  These had
seemed even louder than the bikes.  Sure enough, as they came close,
she heard two separate crunching sounds.  There was some high-pitched
conversation, then the motors started up again.  She tried the same
trick with the mop handle, but by the time she noticed the two ATV&rsquo;s
and realized it wouldn&rsquo;t do anything, it was too late.  The
near figure swerved a bit, then stopped, while the far rider saw the
first stop and turned her vehicle around as well.  The handle was now
trampled and broken into pieces too small to be useful.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi took off her helmet.  &ldquo;Damn
it, Quinn, you almost hit my face!  If anything happens to this face,
my career will be over.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn smirked, &ldquo;Gee, Sandi, I
would never do something to ruin your career; unless, of course, it
meant saving my life.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi jumped at Quinn, and the two
wrestled around while Tiffany watched, trying to see what would do
the most good.  Sandi was able to land two good punches to Quinn&rsquo;s
face, but Quinn kept the upper hand for the next minute straight.
Sandi looked dazed, and Quinn stopped long enough to say, &ldquo;Good
night, Sandi,&rdquo; before head butting her into unconsciousness.
Quinn then stood up and looked at Tiffany, who really wasn&rsquo;t
sure what to do now.  &ldquo;Tiffany, you don&rsquo;t want to fight
me.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany gulped.  &ldquo;No, but they
said if I don&rsquo;t they&rsquo;ll stop paying me, and then I&rsquo;ll
have to get a real job.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn walked up to Tiffany.  &ldquo;Well,
then just tell them you fought hard, but I was just too much.
They&rsquo;ll believe you.  Now forgive me.&rdquo;  Quinn then
punched Tiffany hard in the face, and the violent uppercut was enough
to knock Tiffany out.  Quinn wiped her hands together and surveyed
the scene.  &ldquo;Hmm, Sandi, Tiffany, so where&rsquo;s
StacyEEEEEEEE!&rdquo;  Quinn&rsquo;s thoughts were cut off by a sharp
electrical shock coming from her right leg.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy holstered her taser after
adjusting the settings, and stepped off of her ATV.  &ldquo;Right
here, Quinn.  That was a level three burst.  The next one I hit you
with will be level eight.  It might even be fatal if I hit you in the
right spot.  I have to say thank you for taking out Sandi and Tiffany
before I got here.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn pulled the barbs out of her leg
once she was able to regain control.  &ldquo;Why, because you were as
sick of dealing with them as I was?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy smiled.  At least someone else
noticed.  &ldquo;Well there&rsquo;s that.  But more importantly, if
there were any witnesses, we would have to take you alive.  Now, if
you don&rsquo;t survive, I won&rsquo;t get in trouble.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn gasped.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
actually going to kill me?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; Stacy
replied.  &ldquo;Death may be too good for you.  Let&rsquo;s just say
I won&rsquo;t be holding myself back.  I would hope you wouldn&rsquo;t
hold yourself back either.  I&rsquo;d hate to think I beat you
because you still thought of me as the meek, scared, sheep you tried
to prop up through high school.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn grinned in spite of herself.
&ldquo;Nope, that Stacy wouldn&rsquo;t taser me and threaten my life.
 After Sandi and Tiffany, I expected you to be cowering in a corner.
At least one of my friends isn't as shallow as I knew them to be.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even know the
half of it, but then again, you never will.  Say good night, Gracie.&rdquo;
 Stacy drew her taser, and shot it at Quinn.  Quinn rolled to the
right, and narrowly missed the probe.  While Stacy tried to reload
the taser, Quinn took the initiative and lunged at Stacy.  She
succeeded in disarming her assailant just as it reloaded, but was
quickly punched in the stomach and pushed to the ground.  Stacy was
certainly better skilled than Sandi had been, and she wondered if
Stacy had taken martial arts or military training classes over last
summer.  Quinn had taken several blows to the body, and had scored
only a few lucky shots on Stacy, which failed to even slow her down.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn knew she would lose a straight-up
fight with Stacy, so she rolled her way out of her grasp and dived
behind one of the four-wheelers.  Stacy came around to Quinn, and
Quinn hit Stacy with Tiffany&rsquo;s discarded helmet.  This stunned
Stacy a bit, and Quinn used the moment to go after the taser.  Stacy
saw this and dived at Quinn, catching her as she reached it.  Stacy
and Quinn rolled around, trying to wrest it from each others grasp.
Suddenly, both girls started to convulse.  Quinn rolled Stacy off of
her and shook off what energy had gotten to her.  Stacy was not so
fortunate, for the probe had struck her right in the middle of her
chest.  She didn&rsquo;t even have time to scream before the
electrical current short-circuited her heart.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn finally recovered, and turned to
Stacy, whose body finally stopped convulsing and went limp.  Her eyes
bulged out, and her mouth was wide open.  Quinn touched her arm
tentatively, then checked for a pulse.  Finding none, and hearing no
breathing, she crawled over to the ditch along the road and threw up.
 She had never seen somebody die, and even if Stacy was trying to
kill her, she was still a person, and Quinn still thought of her as a
friend.  She finally calmed herself down, saying, &ldquo;It was her
or me.  She would have done the same to me, and almost did.&rdquo;
She then gathered herself and tried to think of a plan.  Struck by a
bolt of realization, she went to her pack and grabbed her makeup and
mirror.  She then looked for weapons.  &ldquo;Where is that taser,
anyway?&rdquo;  Then she saw it in Stacy&rsquo;s hand.  Even if Quinn
had pointed the gun, it was Stacy who pulled the trigger.


<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chapter Nine


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dennis Jordan stood along with the rest
of his squadron.  His trusty rifle was in his hand, but he would have
felt better if it wasn&rsquo;t filled with rubber bullets.  He knew
that they were just supposed to stop a little girl, but if she was
good enough to get past Stacy, whom he had trained in combat in her
off time, she was a force to be reckoned with.  Then again, Stacy had
always been headstrong.  He knew the big boss wouldn&rsquo;t let him
teach her discipline the way he had been taught, and Stacy had proven
arrogant and overconfident in her abilities.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Off in the distance, he heard a motor
start up again.  Just one motor.  Maybe Stacy had succeeded anyway.
Sandi and Tiffany were hardly worth throwing out there, but maybe
they had kept Quinn occupied for Stacy to strike.  &ldquo;Men, that&rsquo;s
one of the ATV&rsquo;s.  Let&rsquo;s look alive.&rdquo;  Even if he
hadn't been the troop leader, he was respected enough to keep the men
in line regardless.  Everyone raised their weapons and waited for the
ATV to approach.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rider of the SUV was decked in
Stacy&rsquo;s suit, with her helmet obscuring her face.  Behind her
rode an unconscious figure in Jane&rsquo;s hooded sweatshirt and
running pants.  Her arms were around the waist of the helmeted rider,
and she was slumped forward towards the rider&rsquo;s back.  Dennis
called to his men.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Stacy, and Quinn&rsquo;s on the
back.  Stand down.&rdquo;  The men lowered their weapons.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rider came to a stop in front of
them and put up her visor.  &ldquo;I got her, but I&rsquo;m not sure
if she&rsquo;s alive.  Tiffany and Sandi are knocked out back there.
They&rsquo;re alive, so I guess you should send people for them.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The voice had sounded like Stacy, but
Dennis felt something wrong.  As two men moved the second passenger
off the ATV, he asked, &ldquo;Stacy, something wrong with your
voice?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rider grimaced.  &ldquo;Yeah, the
little bitch got me with a lucky punch.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dennis could see the bruise on her face
just to the side of her mouth.  &ldquo;That she did.  Well, at least
it&rsquo;s over now.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the men who had taken the
passenger off was checking vitals.  &ldquo;Sir, this girl is dead.&rdquo;
 He took down the hood from the sweatshirt, revealing Stacy&rsquo;s
brown hair.  &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not Quinn!&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With that, Quinn put down her visor and
revved her ATV.  The gates had been opened to let medics through,
just as Quinn had planned, and she plowed through the couple people
unfortunate enough to be in front of her.  She had made it through,
and she kept going, trying to make sure they didn&rsquo;t catch her
from behind.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back in the control room, the figure in
charge was upset.  &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t even make sure who it was
before you opened the door?  Imbeciles!&rdquo;  The man grabbed his
walkie-talkie.  &ldquo;Quinn, do you hear me?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn heard him all right.  Stacy must
have been half deaf when she set the volume on her helmet.  She found
the talk button on her wrist and pressed it.  &ldquo;Tom?  Honestly,
you&rsquo;re the boss here?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The man known to the public as Tom
Sloane smiled.  &ldquo;I have been ever since the beginning.  I just
figured I would give myself a cameo on the show as Daria&rsquo;s and
Jane&rsquo;s love interest.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; Quinn replied.
&ldquo;Like Daria or Jane would ever go out with you in real life.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Actually, Jane&rsquo;s my lover
right now.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Maybe the actress playing Jane,
but not the Jane I've come to know.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Enough.  You will come back here
now or else!&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Or else what?  If I come back
you&rsquo;ll kill me.  What worse could you do if you have to catch
me?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Quinn, we&rsquo;re not trying to
kill you!&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn slowed her ATV.  &ldquo;Ok, then
what are you planning?  Obviously my life has been a lie.  You don&rsquo;t
expect me to think you&rsquo;re turning this escape into some sort of
game show pilot?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re planning a new
series with you as the star!  Following Daria&rsquo;s spin-off
success, we&rsquo;re moving on to The Quinn Show!  The Fashion Club
follows you into college, with, apparently, a replacement for Stacy.
You get to learn about frat parties and sorority life.  People find
out how smart you really are.  You&rsquo;ll be the star, you hear me?
 The star!&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn rolled her eyes.  Like she
trusted a word that man said.  &ldquo;While that sounds very
generous, I&rsquo;m going to have to say no.  I&rsquo;ve had it with
this life, and your offer doesn&rsquo;t interest me in the least.
I&rsquo;m going to find out who I really am, and I can&rsquo;t inside
your little world.  You&rsquo;ve been keeping me a slave for as long
as I can remember, and you&rsquo;re not going to stop me.&rdquo;
Quinn looked at the landscape, and nothing seemed to be changing for
miles.  &ldquo;Why are you still asking me to reconsider anyway?  I
broke through your little welcoming party and got out of the gate.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;That you did.  But think: are
you really free?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn sighed.  &ldquo;Let me guess: not
really?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, princess!
Your Mario is in another castle!  Just up ahead is the real gate,
with real mercenaries and real ammunition.  You could still go back
and turn yourself in.  I&rsquo;m sure you weren&rsquo;t 100% to blame
for Stacy&rsquo;s death, and an Involuntary Manslaughter charge
wouldn&rsquo;t tie you up in prison for too long.  At least you&rsquo;d
be alive, and you could still be on TV.  Just imagine, the former
Fashion Club diva forced to serve six years in prison, now enters the
real world with no money, no friends, and no family to turn to.  How
will she find the will to pull herself out of the gutter?  Find out
on &lsquo;Quinn&rsquo;s Life on the Skids&rsquo;&rdquo; Tom laughed
thinking about the idea.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn took stock of her situation.
&ldquo;Tom, that proposal made death sound like a good idea.  I&rsquo;ve
got another thought, but if it doesn&rsquo;t work, you better be
prepared to kill me, or you won&rsquo;t like the show I give you.&rdquo;
 With that she clicked off the radio and tore the wiring out of her
helmet.  Repositioning her helmet, she sped up until she could see
the gate on the horizon.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom stewed in his chair.  &ldquo;I was
so hoping to keep her on the schedule, but if I must, I must.&rdquo;
He picked up the walkie-talkie once more.  &ldquo;Omega team, it&rsquo;s
down to you guys.  You know what to do.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A husky voice came through the radio as
a man carrying a high-powered rifle spoke.  &ldquo;Yes, sir.
Terminate on sight.  Over and out.&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom watched as the tracer on Stacy&rsquo;s
ATV got closer and closer to the gate.  Finally, it got within range,
and the command to fire was given.  Each man poured their first
rounds into the ATV, before the captain called off the shots and
ordered every man to scatter.  However, the call had come too late.
The empty ATV crashed into two men before ramming the wall next to
the gate.  The throttle had been tied wide open, and while the ATV
missed the gate itself, the event caused enough confusion to scatter
the gathered force.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Off to the west, Quinn approached the
wall.  As she figured, the wall was impossible to climb and covered
with barbed wire.  Even if she got over it, the regrouped men would
be all over her like the cuts she would have from the barbed wire.
However, since Stacy had kept wire cutters on her ATV, Quinn found
the mesh easy enough to cut through.  She climbed through the small
hole she made, then ran away at top speed.  She wasn&rsquo;t sure she
could trust Tom&rsquo;s declaration that the wall was the real wall,
but she couldn&rsquo;t stop now.  All she knew was she had to find a
real town.  When she found a road 5 minutes later, she looked at the
first sign she came to.  Big Pool, Population 1055.  Her exhaustion
faded somewhat, and she ran with renewed vigor to find the local
sheriff or police station.


<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chapter 10 - Epilogue


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn relaxed in her tiny apartment,
finishing up talking on her cordless phone.  &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not
upset that the rest of the cast wasn&rsquo;t charged.  Sandi and
Stacy were the only ones who attacked me, and really, the damage I
did in self-defense was punishment enough for Sandi.  Well, just that
I&rsquo;m ready to start searching for my real parents and get some
kind of high school diploma to start college.  They&rsquo;re not sure
if I&rsquo;m 17 or 18, but my lawyer was able to convince them I was
able to live on my own until I find my parents.  Oh thanks, it&rsquo;s
been great talking with you too.  Bye!&rdquo;  She thumbed off the
phone and rolled her eyes.  &ldquo;God, who&rsquo;d have thought I&rsquo;d
get sick of talking to people?&rdquo;


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She stretched out on her overstuffed
sofa.  It was a bit threadbare, but it was so comfy.  She may not
have gotten a lot initially from her settlement, but it was enough to
live on for now.  She even heard about cameras set up in her
bathroom, and if they found that evidence, she&rsquo;d be getting
even more.  For now, though, she was going to relax, unwind, and
start figuring out college and how to find her real family.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quinn stood up and got herself a soda.
This Diet Pepsi she found tasted pretty much like Diet Ultra Cola;
maybe even a little better.  It would take a while for her to adjust
to the weird brand names everything had.  She got funny stares when
she asked where the nearest Cashman&rsquo;s was.  She took a can of
soda out of the fridge and crossed over to the latest batch of
flowers she&rsquo;d received, this one from those nice cops in Big
Pool.  She smelled the bouquet; at least flowers still smelled as
sweet as sweet as she remembered.  She looked at one of the flowers.
She thought it odd that one of them had a black center.  Suddenly,
recognizing the shape, she froze.  A Microphone?  Here?  Her mind
raced as she recounted the last mic she had found in a bunch of
flowers, and all the events that spiraled out from that moment.


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Then, a smirk came to her face as she
noticed a wire leading from the bouquet to her front door.  This was
not exactly what she would call high-tech.  Quinn took the microphone
out of the bouquet slowly, grabbed a pan that was sitting on the
counter, and smashed the microphone with the pan.  Immediately, a man
let out a high-pitched shriek just outside her door.  &ldquo;Thanks
for playing!  Please don&rsquo;t try again!&rdquo; she yelled in the
direction of the scream.  These Paparazzi were as bad as the J&rsquo;s
and Upchuck combined.
