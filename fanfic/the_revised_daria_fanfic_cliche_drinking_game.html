<p><br>
<p>Clich&eacute;s are organized by category below. Daria, Jane, Trent,
Tom and Quinn are involved in most of these already, so they do not have
categories. This is meant for parody purposes and not to endorse alcoholism.
Overindulgence in alcohol is not a good thing, much like overindulgence
in other matters.
<p>ALCOHOL
<ul>
<li>
Take a drink if Daria drinks anything alcoholic at a party and wakes up
naked in Trent's bed.&nbsp; If she's naked, take two drinks.&nbsp; If Trent's
in bed with her, empty the bottle. [ASA]</li>

<li>
Should any character develop an alcoholism problem, stop drinking. [DH]</li>
</ul>
AMY
<ul>
<li>
Take a drink when Aunt Amy enters the script as the loving, supportive
older mentor.&nbsp; Two drinks when it turns out she has a high powered
job.&nbsp; Take crack if she shows up as a scientist. [M]</li>

<li>
If Amy gets involved with Trent or Tom, drain the bottle. [DH]</li>
</ul>
ANDREA
<ul>
<li>
If Andrea is friendly to Daria and Jane (relatively speaking), take a drink.
[ASA]</li>

<li>
If Andrea is in the fanfic, and she has five or less lines, take a drink.
[D]</li>

<li>
If Andrea is drinking, drink the whole bottle. [CN]</li>
</ul>
ART
<ul>
<li>
Take a drink if Daria appears naked or nearly naked on any piece of artwork.
[ASA]</li>

<li>
Take a drink if Jane is working on a piece of art. Take two drinks if that
art ends up publically displayed. Take two more drinks if that art becomes
a center of a public controversy. [DH]</li>

<li>
Take two drinks if anyone but a Lane is creating art. (Music doesn't count)
Double this if this art is not for a class. [DH]</li>
</ul>
AUTHOR ECCENTRICITIES:
<ul>
<li>
Take a drink if the fic includes the opening credits.&nbsp; Take two&nbsp;
drinks if you actually change the opening to fit your fic/universe.&nbsp;
Empty the bottle if you actually change the color of the background every
fan season you have. [DM]</li>

<li>
Take a drink if you write a fic parodying all these damn cliches polluting
the world of Daria fanfic (though there's often a reason they became cliches
in the first place...). [R]</li>

<li>
Take a drink every time Peter Guerin references anime outside of a crossover.
[DH]</li>

<li>
Take a drink if an author is using fanon [fan canon] on facts never established
on the show. Take two drinks if the author is referencing the Daria books.
[DH]</li>

<li>
If a renowned shipper author writes a work with Daria &amp; Trent not getting
together or vice versa, drink. [DH]</li>

<li>
Sip each time an author writes in which musical interludes should be playing.
[DH]</li>

<li>
Drink if the author is presenting their piece using formal screenplay style,
indicating camera cuts and such. [DH]</li>

<li>
If the "fanfic" is a drinking game, take a drink.&nbsp; If the drinking
game covers any topic included here, take two drinks.&nbsp; If the drinking
game contains at least one really obvious topic (e.g., the Daria-Trent
relationship and where shippers desperately want it to go), empty the bottle.
[ASA]</li>
</ul>
BRITTANY

<p>COUPLES
