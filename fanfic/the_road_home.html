<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-GB>Northern California</span></i><i><span
lang=EN-GB>, April 1969</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A painfully thin young woman in
a blue calico dress ran a hand through her long, thick, dark-brown hair. She
stood amid a haphazard circle of ramshackle VW buses, small cars, vans, and motorcycles
that ringed a makeshift campsite butted up against a grove of trees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;"All that I am
saying is," she said struggling to keep her voice level. "That we need to be
organised. We need a more equitable sharing of the tasks."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A blurry-eyed man with a scraggly
beard took one last tote from his joint before flicking the roach into the
flames of the small fire that he sat before. "Mellow out, Helen. We're free. We
aren't mindless robots shackled to routine."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You like eating every day,
Bilbo," Helen countered. "It would help if we knew who was going to cook that
night. Neither Wren or E.Z. has bothered to lift a finger since we left </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Florida</span><span lang=EN-GB>."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You sound like my mother.
That's messin' with my buzz," Wren lethargically replied flicking her hand at
her from when she lay on the thick grass. Helen was amazed that she had the
willpower for even that small gesture. Wren downed phennies by the handful and
was rarely awake for more then ten hours in any given day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, Helen," E.Z. added. "You
don't have to bring us down. Things work out, ya know."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They work out because I work
them out," Helen retorted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, as I said, things work
out," laughed E.Z. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helen growled in aggravation.
She spun on a heel and stormed from the camp. Bitter, angry tears clouded her vision
as she stomped through the dry grass entering the trees. It was not suppose to
be like this. She was supposed to be following in Jack Kerouac's footsteps
finding adventure on the open road in the company of poets and musicians, far
from her stifling, mind-numbing </span><span lang=EN-GB>Virginia</span><span
lang=EN-GB> gentry upbringing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, the last ten months
found her with people who were usually too stoned to carry on a coherent
conversation let alone create music or poetry. She crossed the country crammed
in the back of a van with an ever-changing cast of characters that had only
their desire for sex and drugs in common. There was never any money for enough
food but they never ran out of grass no matter how much they smoked. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She viciously swiped at the
tears that ran down her cheeks. She refused to let any of them see her cry. Not
that any of them would understand why she was crying anyhow even if they
noticed. They were footloose gypsies who had reached the promised land of </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>California</span><span lang=EN-GB>. They would be mystified if
Helen told them how unhappy she was.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trees ended at the edge of
the cliff. A hundred odd feet below, the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Pacific Ocean</span><span
lang=EN-GB> crashed endlessly onto the shore. Without bothering to take in the
vista, she plunged rapidly down the narrow trail. The sea would not sympathise
with her plight but the sound of the surf was far preferable to the tedious
voices of her companions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An errant wind crept past her.
Her nose wrinkled in disgust. Away from the massed bodies of the camp, the rank
odour from her own unshaven armpits assailed her nostrils. She needed to bathe
but like everything but weed, soap was in short supply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As she reached the end of the footpath,
she heard someone yell, "Dammit!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helen's head spun about
searching for the voice. At the base of the cliff, a wiry, naked young man with
shaggy hair and long sideburns was standing beside a small waterfall that fell
from the cliff. He was washing himself and suds had evidently gotten into his
eyes. Near him, a large, ten-gallon, metal pot sat on a ring of rocks. Flames
licked the pot from the pit below it.&nbsp; Two smaller cheerfully coloured plastic
pails rested on the sand close by the fire. A course, green-grey blanket was
spread on the ground.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Score," Helen thought. "Soap <i>and
</i>shampoo." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time she crossed to him,
the young man had rescued his stinging eyes. They were bright red but not
unfriendly when he looked up at the sound of her approaching steps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hi," he grunted unabashedly
indifferent to his nudity.&nbsp; He noticed her yesterday when he and his girlfriend
rode into the camp. She looked vaguely familiar but he could not place her.
"I'm sorry but I can't think of your name."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Helen," she replied. "You're
Thumper, right?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He snorted as he shook his
head. "My name's Jake. Thumper was just...just call me Jake, please."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thumper was a pet name that
your girlfriend gave you, then?" Helen asked</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake chuckled ruefully as he
towelled himself dry. "You would think that tagging me with that would have
been warning enough," he sourly replied. "I should have run like a scalded dog
the first time Rain called me that. I'm not going to miss her or that dumb ass
nickname but I tell you, her taking my bike was low."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helen nodded. She was one of
several people who had to dive out of the way as Rain recklessly tore out of
camp earlier in the afternoon on the back of Jake's Triumph Thunderbird.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake snorted again. "Rain. Her
name was really Roberta. Everyone seems to adopt the most ridiculous aliases on
the road. It's not like anyone gives a damn enough to look for any of us so why
bother?" </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helen cleared her throat
uncomfortably. For the first few months that she was on the road, Helen called
herself 'Breeze'. In hindsight, it was as ridiculous as he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jake, I really need a bath but
I'm out of soap and shampoo. Can I borrow some of yours?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake smiled. "Sure but I don't
think that borrow is the right word."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She smiled back at him. He had
a dry sense of humour. "No, I suppose not."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All that you need is right
there," he answered pointing at the bar and bottle resting on a rock. "Help
yourself." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thanks for sharing, man,"
Helen said gratefully.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're welcome," he replied
casually. "Nobody has anything out here. We can only get by with everyone
helping each other."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There's a few that haven't
learned that yet," growled Helen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinking it best not to ask
about her comment, Jake ignored it.&nbsp; "I'm about to wash my clothes.&nbsp; I can add
your dress to the mix if you like."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Keep being this nice and I'm
going to have your baby," Helen kidded. "Thanks again. It needs washing as bad
as I do. We came up through the desert."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She pulled the dress over her
head. She wore no undergarments. Inwardly she laughed at the ease with which
she stripped outdoors in front of a man who was a near complete stranger. Not
too long ago she had been uncomfortable changing for gym class and there was
naught but girls present in an enclosed room. "I was a lot of things not too
long ago," she thought. "With uptight virgin being at the top of the list."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry but I have only the one
wash cloth," he said accepting her thin dress.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Beggars can't be choosers."
She answered shoving her head under the cascading water. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake tossed her calico dress
into the pot of boiling water.&nbsp; Humming to himself, he stirred their clothes with
stout piece of driftwood.&nbsp; He paid no attention to the woman scant feet from
him narrowing his focus to his simple task. With the rhythm of an ancient
galley oarsman, he slowly raised and lowered each article of clothing, suds
bubbling up and bursting as he worked. Like the dirt leaving the clothes, each
stroke drained a bit more of the residue anger over the theft of his motorcycle
from him.&nbsp; By the time he was satisfied that the laundry was clean, the ire was
gone leaving only some mild regret and steadfast determination in its place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After meticulously rinsing the
clothes in the small buckets, he draped them over some bushes. Only then did he
turn to Helen who was still luxuriating under her improvised shower. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"Whoa," he
thought, truly looking at her for the first time. He gazed at her raptly for a
few moments before shaking his head. "Forget it, clod. A woman like her would not
have anything to do with a loser like you."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was about to walk away when
Helen noticed him. "Will you scrub my back, please?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure," he squeaked. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He coughed. "Yeah, sure," Jake
replied in a steadier voice taking the cloth from her. He winced secretly as he
moved his hand firmly over her body. He could feel every rib easily. The girl
had been through some lean times. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young woman peered over her
shoulder as Jake washed her back. "So what caused you and Rain to break up?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake exhaled in a loud sigh. "I
guess you can say a divergence of opinion as to future direction."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What? She wanted to go to </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>L.A.</span><span lang=EN-GB> and you wanted to go to </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Alaska</span><span lang=EN-GB>?" </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake bent down and swirled the
washcloth in the water before wringing it thoroughly. "Somewhat more involved
then that," he finally replied. "But I just don't have the energy to go into it
right now."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Left all of it in D.C. trying
to raise the Pentagon last summer?" Helen quipped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>Jake blinked in
confusion before bursting into laughter. "You were there, weren't you?" he
said. "I remember you now."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"Yes, I was."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>Jake chuckled at
his own foolishness. "I was so high on mescaline I really thought that I could
levitate the building. Just further proof if any more was needed that I am a
complete idiot."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey man, the power of positive
thought and all of that, you know," Helen answered.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake shrugged. "I'm positive
about some things."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And one of them cost you a
girlfriend today," Helen guessed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake grinned. The scrawny girl
was nothing if not tenacious. She would not be satisfied until she had her
questions answered. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I would hasten my escape from
the windy storm and tempest," he quoted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's from Psalms," she
replied. "Religious differences broke you apart?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," Jake replied. "But the
sentiment behind that line did. The thing is Helen; I'm tired of drifting. The
Old Man showed me the door nearly four years ago and I've been on the road
since then. It was cool for a while. I backpacked across </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>Europe</span><span lang=EN-GB>; cruised through a good chunk of </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>North America</span><span lang=EN-GB> on my bike. Even got as far
as </span><span lang=EN-GB>Australia</span><span lang=EN-GB> working as a deck
hand but now I'm just so damn tired travelling. All I want to do is find a job
so that I can sleep in my own bed every night instead of whatever patch of
ground I find myself on when the sun sets. That might make it easier for the
government to find me if you want to draft my ass but I'm willing to take that
chance. Rain thought that made me some kind of sell-out to the man." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helen nodded at him but did not
say anything as she dried herself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake frowned. Suddenly and
inexplicably, it was very important to him that she understood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that it's not about
things but look at that," he said pointing at his clothes hanging on the
bushes. "Thanks to the light-fingered Rain, that's all I own in the world; two
pairs of jeans, three tee shirts, and a pair of boots. I mean, damn, I don't
even have any socks. I've become the bum my old man always said I was."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fact that you're willing
to work to make a better life for yourself I think proves your father wrong,"
she said. "And Rain was wrong also. Wanting a home doesn't make you a cog in a
fascist machine. There is always a middle ground."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah," Jake agreed. "The
problem is that the ground keeps crumbling under me. I haven't known anything
solid since I've been on my own." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So you're going back to your hometown?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Never!" Jake roared. "I'm only
going back there when that son-of-a-bitch is dead so I can piss on his grave." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helen took a step back in the
face of Jake's sudden fury. She had disagreements with her parents and sisters
but nothing to excite the sort of passion that exploded from Jake. "I really
hit a nerve," she thought to herself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look, I'm sorry," Jake
apologised seeing Helen's frightened reaction. "It's...I'm just screwed up,
okay?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure, it's cool," she replied.
Jake might have some problems but her intuition told her that he was harmless.
"So what are you going to do?" </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hitch a ride with my buddy
Coyote," Jake replied. "He's heading for </span><span lang=EN-GB>Boulder</span><span
lang=EN-GB> in a couple of days. His brother started a commune near there. I'll
stay with them for a while, find a job, save up a few bucks then get a car or
another bike and go back east."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And then?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake chuckled. She was
definitely tenacious. "Like I said, I'll go the bourgeois route and find
another job and work for the rest of my life. It's pure establishment but
that's what I'm going to do."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"So why a job and not
college?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "College?" Jake laughed. "Are
you kidding me? What college would accept me? Trust me, one look at my high
school grades and I'd be chased off any campus for having the audacity to try."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're wrong," Helen replied.
"I think that you are intelligent."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, maybe not but it
doesn't matter," he said. "I don't have the bread and I'm too old."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now that's a cop-out," Helen
countered. "You're what? Twenty-two? Twenty-three? Many men came home from
World War Two and Korea older then that and went on to college and more then
one person has worked his way through school."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake started to say something
but stopped himself. Instead, he eased his body down onto the blanket. Helen
sat down beside him but it was several long moments before anyone spoke. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why aren't you in college?" he
finally asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helen exhaled slowly, regret
written large on her face. "Because I was a spoiled brat who, when she did not
get what she wanted, scorned what she had."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't understand."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I applied to five schools,
Jake," Helen answered. "Only my safety, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Middleton</span><span
 lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>College</span><span lang=EN-GB>, accepted
me. Instead of going there, I stuffed some crap into a backpack and split." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And now you're here."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah," she sighed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah," Jake quietly echoed
watching two sea gulls squabble over something that washed up on the shore. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helen joined him in his silent
contemplation of the seascape. From time to time, she would steal a covert
glance at the young man sitting by her. He was so lost in his own thoughts that
she was not sure if he even remembered that she was even there after a while. When
it became evident that Jake was not going to make a move, she decided to seize
the initiative. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jake, can I go with you to </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Boulder</span><span lang=EN-GB>?" she asked hopefully.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go with me?" he asked in
surprise. "Sure, if you want to. We'd have to ask Coyote. It's his car but I'm
sure it'll be cool with him."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you," she said sliding a
hand across his thigh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A small gasp of pleasure
escaped his mouth as her hand slid even further. His kindled desire
notwithstanding, he, nevertheless, lifted her hand from him. "Look, Helen, when
I said that I didn't mean to imply that there were any strings attached. You
don't have to do anything you don't want to."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And if I want to?" she asked leaning
over to kiss him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun was a fireball on the
horizon when Coyote made his way with trepidation down the trail to the beach.
He hated heights so he kept his eyes resolutely on his feet until the ground
mercifully levelled out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, Jake," he shouted. "You
around here, man?" </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He laughed as he spied his
friend untangling himself from a woman. "Damn, dude, that was quick work," he
said as he walked over to the couple.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is it, Coyote?" Jake
asked not completely successful at keeping the irritation out of his voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Change of plans, hoss," he
replied. "We're splitting tonight."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, okay," Jake said as he
stood. "Can I bring Helen along?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Helen, I assume, is that
lovely girl beside you," Coyote chuckled. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I am," she replied. "May
I join you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hi, Helen," Coyote said with a
friendly wave of his hand. "Yeah, sure, no problem. you'll be company for </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Willow</span><span lang=EN-GB>."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who's </span><span lang=EN-GB>Willow</span><span
lang=EN-GB>?" Jake asked</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, man, you're not the only
dude the chicks find irresistible," joked Coyote. "She's a girl that rolled into
camp t a couple of hours ago. The people she's with want to stay here but she
wants to go on to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Colorado</span><span lang=EN-GB> so I
offered her a ride. See you in a few minutes."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be right there," Jake said to
his friend's back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He helped Helen to her feet. "I
thought that it would be cool with him. Coyote's all right."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;"He's cool but he
was wrong," she said. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake frowned. "What was he
wrong about?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"That wasn't quick
work," Helen answered puckishly patting him on the buttocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She giggled
when he actually blushed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"Thanks," Jake
gushed. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>Helen was slightly
taken aback. "He jumped on that compliment like a dog on a bone," she thought.
"Just how bad has his life been to make simple praise so precious?"&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>Jake started to
pull on a tee shirt when Helen stopped him. "Coyote and </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Willow</span><span lang=EN-GB> might appreciate it if we washed
first."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, the smell
of rut..."Jake began. "I'm sorry that was crude. I don't want you to think
...you're not just..."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"A piece of ass,"
Helen supplied. "A warm body."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah," Jake stammered.
"I mean...yeah, you're more then that. Damn, I ..."&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"I understand what
you're trying to say," Helen said walking toward the waterfall. "Now, will you
wash my back again?" </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"My pleasure,"
Jake quipped joining her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>It was nearly dark
as Jake threw on a sky-blue tee shirt, a pair of jeans and boots before quickly
folding his remaining clothes forming a neat pile with them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"Are you sure you
weren't in the army?" Helen asked watching him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"No, just six
years of military school," he replied. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>Helen nodded but
before she could speak, Jake continued in an increasing strident voice.
"School, my ass! Freaking prison. The Old Man wanted me to be trained as cannon
fodder but Jakey wouldn't cooperate would he, Mad Dog? He would not go along
with your plans to get him gloriously killed!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>He spun and
savagely kicked one of the plastic pails sending it bouncing across the beach.
Helen took a cautious step back but Jake made no further move other then
hanging his head and taking several deep breaths. Such outbursts were beyond
Helen's realm of experience. Uncertain as to what to do, she stayed still. The
silence lengthened uncomfortably until Jake finally broke it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;"I'll understand
if you would prefer not to come with me," he said quietly keeping his eyes away
from Helen. "You're probably afraid to be with someone as messed up as me." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"Where does your
father live?" she asked in a harsh, savage voice. "Have Coyote drive us there
and we'll kill him."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>Jake whipped
around. "Are you nuts?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>Helen abruptly
laughed pulling him into a hug. "If you won't harm someone you hate that much,
I think that I'll be safe around you. I don't think that you'll hurt me."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"Hurt a woman!" a
horrified Jake exclaimed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>Helen cocked her
head inquisitively. "You really respect women, don't you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"What few decent
people that I've ever know have all been women," he replied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"Whether or not I
still qualify as decent is open to debate," Helen said. "But now, let's grab
everything and go find Coyote. He and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Willow</span><span
lang=EN-GB> are probably ready to leave."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"Ah, yeah, Coyote
did sound impatient," Jake stammered. The girl had him confused. She saw him at
his worst yet it did not seem to perturb her, at least not enough to scare her
away. Was she that desperate to leave or did she ...no, he dared not hope that
she truly liked him. A man like him does not have a girl fall into his lap, a
better girl then what he had yet here she was. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"Just run with it,
idiot," he thought as he followed her up the footpath. "Sooner or later, she'll
figure out that you're not good enough for her. Until then, enjoy the ride.
It's not like you have anything else to lose."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"Where is Coyote
parked?" Helen asked as they reached the top.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"Over there," Jake
pointed. "That blue Beetle. Go get your stuff and we'll be off."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"This is it,"
Helen answered, waving a hand over her ensemble. "What little I brought with me
on the road has long since been ripped off and there is no one here I care to
say good-bye to so we can just book. What's so funny?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"Nothing, really,"
Jake replied stifling his mirth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"C'mon, out with
it," Helen said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>Jake shrugged his
shoulders. "I just thought that if we ever had kids, we could honestly tell
them that we started with nothing."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>Helen smiled
enigmatically at him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>Coyote was
standing beside a tall teenaged girl with long auburn hair. A large brown
shepherd with a red bandana tied around his neck sat between them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"You guys ready to
go," Coyote called out. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, man," Jake
shouted back. "On the road to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Boulder</span><span
lang=EN-GB>."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"No, Jake," Helen quietly
said squeezing his arm. "We're on the road home."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>
