<h1><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>The Sound and the QB </span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Synopsis: </u>&nbsp;A tale told by Kevin Thompson,
signifying nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>On the field, through the cheering crowd spaces,
I could see them throwing. The team in training. They had already begun without
me. As QB, that should have been me throwingthe ball. Yet they went on, without
me being there. Time had passed too quickly. I continued walking and soon
arrived at the field. While the team trained Coach spoke to me;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;Late again? What are you, some sort
of moron?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;Uh, sorry Coach!&#8221;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;Look at you, nineteen years old and
still unable to pass high school.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;Going on nine for ten years,more
like.&#8221; added another angry voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;It&#8217;s not my fault&#8221;, I
said, &#8220;Keeping track of time is really hard.&#8221; Then I began to run,
to take my place. As I ran, the white lines passed beneath me in their routine
order. One by one. The ball is in the air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-AU>Running along the field, the ball began
to drop...</span></i><span lang=EN-AU> The ball landed in Mack&#8217;s hands
and he scored, grinning broadly. My mouth also turned upright, smiling. I could
feel the shouting, passing through the ground. There were lots of people there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;Kevvie! Go team!&#8221; said
Brittany and the squad. 21-17 said the board. My team was now ahead. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;Great pass&#8221; said a J.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m the
QB&#8217;, I said, my smile even larger. People dig my smiles, and like to copy
them, I think. Everyone was smiling, bright faces all around me. The bell rang,
and we shook hands and then I drank. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8216;Well done Kevin! A match winning
pass in your first game!&#8221; said Coach. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-AU>Coach&#8230; </span></i><span
lang=EN-AU>Sitting in my cold seat, frozen, I gave an answer, or tried to. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8216;Uh&#8230;Coach?&#8221;. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;No Ke<b>vin</b>&#8221; said
DeMartino, &#8220;Coach was <b>not</b> a rank used in the Vietnam <b>War</b>!
Many men, <b>good</b> men died there,and this is all the <b>respect</b> you can
<b>give</b> them?&#8221; Soon, I heard lingering laughter from all corners, but
still sat there, smiling. I had tried my best, and could do no more. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>My past is my present. Or is that &#8216;my
present is my past&#8217;? Whatever. Like it really matters... History never
came to me like some, like Daria and her friend, they know about that stuff, or
Mack Daddy and Jodie, or even Brittany. <i>Brittany</i><i>.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>She stood in the parking lot, looking hot
like she always does. But something was wrong; her voice had an edge to it that
usually wasn&#8217;t there. Was something wrong? I ask;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;Um, Brit... remember when you said
you'd still be my babe, no matter where I went to school?&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>Her look is still weird. She looks puzzled,
which is weird, as I&#8217;m the one who gets puzzled. Not Brittany. Her
silence makes me speak again;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;See, um, my grades were so good,
they want to see if I can do it again!&#8220;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>She doesn&#8217;t believe me. I&#8217;m not
even sure if I believe me.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-AU>It had worked before</span></i><span
lang=EN-AU>, but DeMartino still talked, &#8220;Are you an <b>idiot</b>?&#8221;
&#8216;Coach?&#8221; I said, still smiling. &#8220;Kevin! This is not football!
Is that the only thing you know?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;Um&#8230; Yes?&#8221; I respond,
saying the truth. His eye comes forward out of his head. Looks pretty cool, if
a bit gross.&nbsp; He is really angry. But I was only speaking what I thought.
Is there something wrong with that? I get that look a lot. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>About the only time I don&#8217;t get it is
when I&#8217;m on the football field. There I know what I&#8217;m doing, and
people look up to me. And not just the short dudes. I have seen players on the
other team be scared. They don&#8217;t look like that when I&#8217;m not out
there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-AU>I&#8217;m still there.</span></i><span
lang=EN-AU> After three years, I am still the QB. I&#8217;m the QB! That sounds
right. I wonder how long I can keep it up for? Will I still be here in a year?
I really don&#8217;t know, that question is like the others, hard. Really hard!
Makes me think like a little monkey and hey, they are cool. Especially thatone
who got in trouble. I think his name was George. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-AU>George</span></i><span lang=EN-AU>.
It&#8217;s funny, another guy called George came to school yesterday. He
didn&#8217;t look like a student though, dressed in brown and wearing metal
medals. They were in a row, like a well-arranged pack. He walked up and began
to speak;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;Kevin Thompson? I&#8217;m here to
offer you an exciting opportunity.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;What?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;You like football, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;Sure! It&#8217;s like my favourite
thing man!&#8221;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;Yes. Well, how would you like to
join the team?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>I was puzzled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;Uh what team?&#8221; I asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>George looked happy, like he had scored the
winning touchdown or had fun in the back of a car;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;Oh, the best team. The <i>United States of America</i>. We want to spike our opposition, but need recru&#8230;.
Uh, volunteers, to join the team. Will you help?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>I must have made the national team.They
wouldn&#8217;t ask me otherwise. Whoa! This is pretty cool. Better say
something&#8212;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;Sure!&#8221;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>He shakes my hand and hands me papers.
I&#8217;ve made the right choice. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-AU>The right choice</span></i><span
lang=EN-AU>. I am still running, and am happy, even if Coach shouted at me.
It&#8217;s too late to change that now, and he won&#8217;t do it. I&#8217;m
still the QB, whatever he says&#8230; Although I still have to tell him about
George and the national team. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;Where will we go?&#8221; I think,
looking at a paper. The paper has some country called Iraq onit. Where is that place anyway? Hope there&#8217;s a big stadium there, and good
cheerleaders, or babe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-AU>Babe<b>. Brittany</b></span></i><span
lang=EN-AU>. She kisses me softly, but still looks funny. And for some reason,
her hand is gone, like she&#8217;s hiding something. Then the thought goes
away, as I start to kiss her and the shapes around me disappear leaving only
us, us in the middle of lines passing everywhere in a blur. And then she left.
The shapes returned to how they are when I&#8217;m not with Brittany. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>It&#8217;s funny, but something still seems
wrong. Why wasn&#8217;t she proud of me? Even Mr O&#8217;Neill said I couldgo
to any college <i>in the country!</i> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>I&#8217;m in a new country. The shapes are just
one big lot of sand. This uniform isn&#8217;t what I thought it was meant to
be. They didn&#8217;t even give me shoulder pads. Another lecture. The captain
talks and keeps on talking. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>People talk to me a lot. Even DeMartino
would go on talking to me, saying loud words and shaking, looking angry. When
they use big words, I try to listen, but they go through me like a dropped
pass.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-AU>Dropped pass.</span></i><span
lang=EN-AU> As I walk up the field the ball goes to ground. This is easier to
think about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;You should have caught the
ball!&#8221; I call out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>No one thanks me. Sometimes it makes me
angry, but that red anger passes quickly, and I try to smile. Maybe that will
help.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;Pay a<b>ttent</b>ion!&#8221;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;Pay attention!&#8221;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>It isn&#8217;t helping, and some angry guy
is shooting. All around me, the team is shooting. I never had to do this onthe
football field, and now the sky is filling with sound and light, shells are
flying and the sand is getting in my way. Someone sees a backpack near us, that
seems to be making little noises, one by one,in some regular path. The noise
keeps getting louder, until I can see the shaking; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:18.0pt'>&#8220;Company! <b>DUCK!</b>&#8221;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>A duck? Where&#8212;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>I fall, and get put on a stretcher.
It&#8217;s like when I broke my leg, only I don&#8217;t remember all this blood
all over me. Ouch! The light is now swimming through the air, and getting
darker, just as.. Just as.. I want to be somewhere else. Football never hurt
like this. Maybe if I think I can go somewhere else, while the light keeps
moving past me, and it won&#8217;t stop or slow&#8212;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>Brittany</span><span lang=EN-AU> is waiting
for me, and smiling. She holds me tight, and I hold her back. Everyone is happy
after my game tonight, even Mack Daddy. The shouting isn&#8217;t angry now.
Soon I drift into a bed, and the light is gone, but Brittany is herewith me,
breathing fast. The air is warm and I want to sleep like this now, for however
long, until the sun wakes up again. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;Kevvy, I love you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;You too,Babe. We&#8217;ll be like,
forever right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>&#8220;Yes Yes Yes!&#8221; </span></p>
