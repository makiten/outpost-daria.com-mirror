<P>Summary: Why exactly do Daria and Tom keep breaking up 
and<BR>
making up?</P>

<P>Soundtrack: Dave Matthews Band, 7-25-2001, 
AmSouth Amphitheater,<BR>
Amazing show, the Flecktones always make 
great guests.</P>

<P>"The Space Between our wicked lies is where we 
hope to
keep safe<BR>
from pain."</P>

<P>The Space 
Between</P>

<P>"Well if that's the way you feel about it maybe we 
should
call it<BR>
quits!"</P>

<P>"That would be fine by me, if you 
keep insisting on being
so<BR>
pig-headed!"</P>

<P>"Fine, it's 
over."</P>

<P>"Good, I don't know why I ever thought going out 
with
such a<BR>
stubborn person was a good idea!"</P>

<P>"Oh just 
get out of my sight before I hurt you."</P>

<P>"All right then, get 
out of my car and I'll do just that."</P>

<P>A door slammed and a 
car drove off, leaving a figure standing
on<BR>
the curb.  The girl, 
for it was a girl who got out of the car,<BR>
watched it drive away. 
She sighed and walked up to the house<BR>
she'd been left in front 
of.  She sighed a second time and walked<BR>
into the 
house.</P>

<P>&lt;Daria&gt;</P>

<P>I tried not to slam the door 
after I let myself in, and was
only<BR>
marginally successful in not 
doing so.  Fortunately I doubted<BR>
that anyone was home to ask any 
questions I didn't want to<BR>
answer.  Foremost on that list being 
"How's Tom?"  Because
quite<BR>
frankly, at that moment I didn't give 
a rat's ass if Tom lived
or<BR>
died...no, that's not true, I would 
have cared if he died, but<BR>
mostly in a guilt-ridden I don't want 
to decide who lives and<BR>
dies sort of way.</P>

<P>I reached for 
the phone to call Jane and rail to her about
what a<BR>
flaming ass 
her ex-boyfriend was.  "No, damn, she had a thing<BR>
with Ryan 
tonight. Two years ago who would have thought that we'd<BR>
each have 
a date on the same night?"  I asked myself.  I<BR>
certainly wouldn't 
have, in fact if anyone had told me that I<BR>
would've laughed in 
his or her face.  But life is a funny thing<BR>
and we did have 
dates, just mine ended a little sooner than I<BR>
expected.</P>

<P>I 
sighed, standing around in the living room wasn't 
accomplishing<BR>
anything, so I decided to at least go upstairs to 
my room and
get<BR>
some homework done.  As I walked down the hall to 
my room I saw<BR>
the light on under Quinn's door, it seems she was 
home.</P>

<P>"Crap," I muttered to myself and walked into my 
room,
again not<BR>
quite succeeding in not slamming the 
door.</P>

<P>&lt;Quinn&gt;</P>

<P>I heard Tom's car drive off, 
believe me if you've heard Tom's
car<BR>
once you'll never forget it, 
and then the front door slam shut.
<BR>
I groaned since I knew that 
could only mean one thing; Daria and<BR>
Tom's date hadn't gone well. 
The oddity of the situation wasn't<BR>
lost on me, Daria out on a 
date and me home studying.  Now that's<BR>
not quite fair.  I did 
have a date for the night, but he came<BR>
down with a sudden case of 
food poisoning and was in the<BR>
hospital.  By that time my 
fall-back date was already out with<BR>
Stacy, and I'd already 
stolen, not on purpose mind you, one of<BR>
Stacy's dates that week 
so I figured I'd be nice to Stacy and
not<BR>
poach her date, again. 
So there I was, in my pajamas no less,<BR>
doing a chemistry 
assignment when I should have been at Chez<BR>
Pierre, when Daria 
came storming into the house.  And boy, Daria<BR>
can storm like 
nobody else, I think it's her boots.  I heard her<BR>
stomp up the 
stairs and march into her room, slamming that door<BR>
too.</P>

<P>I 
slowly counted to ten then got up and walked over to 
Daria's<BR>
room, chemistry book in hand.  Yeah, it wasn't exactly 
the<BR>
smartest decision I've ever made, but what else was I going 
to<BR>
do, my homework?  Besides, she'd welcome the 
distraction.</P>

<P>I knocked on the door, "Hey Daria, mind helping 
me out
with<BR>
something?"  I asked the door.</P>

<P>"Why sure 
Quinn, I'd love to, come on in," she replied.
 Well,<BR>
not really, 
she actually said, "No way in hell, go away."
 But I<BR>
knew what 
she meant; you don't spend your entire life living with<BR>
a grouch 
and not pick up on some of her moods.  I opened the<BR>
door, ready 
to use my chemistry book as a shield; after all I'm<BR>
not 
stupid.</P>

<P>"Quinn, I told you to stay the hell out," Daria 
growled.</P>

<P>"But Daria, I really need help with this problem,"
I 
pleaded. <BR>
Actually, I didn't need the help that badly, but I 
wanted to know<BR>
what this fight was about.</P>

<P>Daria sighed, 
"All right, what's the problem?"</P>

<P>"I'm having trouble 
balancing this equation."  I
held out my chem<BR>
book, indicating a 
problem at random.</P>

<P>Daria took the book from me and looked at 
the problem.  "You<BR>
can't be serious, you're having trouble with 
this problem?"</P>

<P>"Uh yeah."  I couldn't really remember which 
problem
I had<BR>
pointed to.</P>

<P>"This one's easy, just count 
the hydrogen, even you could
figure<BR>
that out."  Daria handed the 
book back to me.</P>

<P>"Oh right, heh, thanks."  I took the book 
and looked
at the<BR>
problem.  Sure enough, it was one I'd already 
solved.  "I
never<BR>
remember how those ones go," I said quickly to 
cover my butt.</P>

<P>"Why are you here Quinn?"  Daria asked, her 
eyes
narrowing in<BR>
suspicion.</P>

<P>"Like I said, I couldn't 
figure out that problem/"</P>

<P>"No, I mean why are you here at 
home?  Don't you have
a date?"</P>

<P>"Oh, Jamir came down with a 
case of botulism, and Jeffy
had<BR>
already left on a date with 
Stacy, and I didn't want to steal<BR>
another one of Stacy's dates, 
even though the first time this<BR>
week really was an accident.  But 
still it wouldn't be fair to<BR>
Stacy, which isn't to say that she 
needs the help or anything,<BR>
but you know, it's always so rude to 
steal someone's date."
 Yes,<BR>
I was babbling, but it's a great way 
to get Daria to do what I<BR>
want.  For some reason she claims she 
can't stand the sound of
my<BR>
voice, I don't understand why, but 
there it is.</P>

<P>"Quinn, get to the point, if you have one," 
Daria
snapped.</P>

<P>"The point is, what are you doing home so 
early?  I know
you had<BR>
a date with Tom, and I also know he has 
more sense than to eat<BR>
rotten food..."</P>

<P>"We had a fight," 
Daria said simply.</P>

<P>"Oh, about what?"</P>

<P>"I don't want to 
talk about it."</P>

<P>"Damn, she's not going to say, maybe if I try 
a different<BR>
approach," I thought, "So, when are you two going 
to
get back<BR>
together?"  I asked her.</P>

<P>"Who says we are?" 
Daria replied as she sat down
on her bed.</P>

<P>"Because you two 
always get back together, you have a
fight, talk<BR>
things out and 
move on, that's the way things work."</P>

<P>"But why does that have 
to be the way things work?  It
looks to<BR>
me like things aren't 
working very well at all."</P>

<P>"Oh, so you're really broken up 
for good this time?"
 I asked.</P>

<P>"Sure, why not," Daria 
grumbled.  "Tom's proven
he's nothing more<BR>
than an insufferable 
ass, so why keep going out with him?"</P>

<P>I wanted to say because 
the two of them were a great couple,
but<BR>
I knew Daria wouldn't 
listen to me.  "Want me to set you
up with<BR>
someone else then? 
You know, to help you forget about Tom?"
<BR>
When all else fails ask 
a stupid question.  It's worked before.</P>

<P>"Why on earth would 
you think I'd want to go out with
anyone you<BR>
picked out for 
me?"</P>

<P>"A change of pace?"  Yes, I knew she'd say that,
and I 
also knew<BR>
she'd hate going out with anyone I'd set her up with. 
But I<BR>
liked having a sister who dated; it made her seem 
more<BR>
accessible.  So anything I could do to get Daria back 
together<BR>
with Tom was worth it.</P>

<P>"Get out Quinn, I'm not 
in the mood to deal with you."</P>

<P>I've got enough sense to know 
when not to push things, and
then<BR>
was not a time to push.  "All 
right, sheesh, just offer some<BR>
sisterly advice and you get your 
head bitten off, some<BR>
gratitude."  I walked out of the room and 
went back to my
room to<BR>
finish my 
homework.</P>

<P>&lt;Daria&gt;</P>

<P>I watched Quinn walk out of 
my room then shoved a chair against<BR>
my door to make sure she 
didn't come barging back in.  It wasn't<BR>
that I didn't want to 
talk to someone - just not her.  Talking
to<BR>
Quinn was a big 
enough drain on my intelligence under the best<BR>
conditions and 
when I was in an especially bad mood, like just<BR>
then; it could be 
a deadly mix, for Quinn, not me.</P>

<P>I stretched out on my bed 
and tried to make sense out of the<BR>
evening.  The reason I hadn't 
told Quinn what Tom and I were<BR>
fighting about was because I 
couldn't really remember, my anger<BR>
had driven the cause of the 
fight right out of my memory, and<BR>
that's what really upset me, if 
something so inconsequential that<BR>
I couldn't even remember a 
half-hour later caused Tom and I to<BR>
have a nasty fight then what 
would happen when something really<BR>
serious came 
up?</P>

<P>Whatever that fight was caused by might have been a petty 
reason<BR>
to break up, but it pointed to a more serious flaw in 
our<BR>
relationship.  One that I thought was a fatal 
flaw.</P>

<P>"Then again, do I really want to break up with Tom?"
 I 
asked<BR>
myself.  "Quinn's right, we have had more than a few 
fights,
but<BR>
we've always gotten back together, so why should this 
be any<BR>
different?"  I toyed with my sheets as I waited for the 
answer<BR>
to arrive.  I looked over at the drawer I keep my family 
pictures<BR>
in and then it hit me.</P>

<P>"That's the exact sort of 
relationship Mom and Dad have.
 One<BR>
minute they're as 
dysfunctional as the Mansons and the next<BR>
they're making out on 
the couch."  I winced at the imagery
that<BR>
thought called to mind, 
but it was there nevertheless, and long<BR>
ago I had made a promise 
to myself that I would never get<BR>
involved in that sort of 
relationship.</P>

<P>I sighed, "Well hell, I've been so good at 
letting everyone
else<BR>
down why not myself as well?"</P>

<P>I 
stared out my window as all these thoughts ran through any<BR>
mind. 
The one thing that did seem clear to me was that I didn't<BR>
want to 
be my parents.  That was something I'd been trying to<BR>
avoid that 
my whole life and I wasn't about to change now.  It's<BR>
not that I 
don't love my parents, but for as long as I remember<BR>
they've 
provided me with guidance on how not to live my life.
 I<BR>
wasn't 
about to give up on a perfectly good guiding principle<BR>
just 
because of Tom.</P>

<P>"Well, it was fun while it lasted," I 
thought, still
I couldn't<BR>
shake a nagging feeling that maybe, 
just maybe I was wrong.</P>

<P>&lt;Tom&gt;</P>

<P>"I didn't go 
straight home after I left Daria at her house.
<BR>
Instead I drove 
around Lawndale for a while, trying to think<BR>
things out.  I just 
don't get it, we're two smart individuals,<BR>
why do Daria and I 
have to get into these stupid arguments on
a<BR>
regular basis? 
She's always so damn ready to seize on any little<BR>
thing I say and 
blow it all out of proportion.  This time was
no<BR>
different.  For 
whatever reason our discussion turned to the<BR>
topic of vision 
correction, and Daria admitted that last year<BR>
she'd briefly 
experimented with wearing contacts.  So I said,<BR>
jokingly that I'd 
like to see that.  Then she just went off on<BR>
me.  I don't quite 
know why but she did, and goodness knows I<BR>
didn't react well to 
that.  So I dropped her off at her house
and<BR>
we exchanged a few 
parting shots, and now I guess we're broken<BR>
up."  I took a deep 
breath, "So, what do you think?"</P>

<P>"I think," Elsie said 
slowly, "that you are
a world class idiot."</P>

<P>"Gee, thanks," I 
grumbled.  I found Elsie sitting
in the kitchen<BR>
eating cookies, 
naturally I joined her, and just as naturally<BR>
started talking 
about the latest blow up with Daria.  Elsie<BR>
always was willing to 
listen to me complain about my love life.
<BR>
She said it was more 
entertaining than television.</P>

<P>"I also think you've got some 
decisions to make."</P>

<P>"Like?"</P>

<P>"Like whether or not this 
is how you want to end your<BR>
relationship with Daria you chowder 
head!"  Elsie shouted.</P>

<P>"Oh, right," I mumbled into my glass 
of milk.</P>

<P>"Do you really want some silly argument over contact 
lenses
to be<BR>
what breaks you two up?"  I didn't respond because I 
didn't
have<BR>
an answer.  "It's a really stupid reason to stay 
broken up."
 She<BR>
added.</P>

<P>I shrugged, "It's not my decision 
to make, it's Daria's."</P>

<P>"But what do you 
want?"</P>

<P>"That's not really relevant is it?"</P>

<P>"The hell 
it's not," Elsie said angrily.  "Tom,
you've been<BR>
dating Daria 
longer than any of your other girlfriends, you<BR>
introduced her to 
Mom and Dad, and you've gotten back together<BR>
with her after 
arguments that would have annihilated some of your<BR>
former 
relationships.  You're a smart guy, do the math.  Plus
I<BR>
kind of 
like her, she doesn't take any crap from you.  I 
respect<BR>
that."</P>

<P>"Maybe because it's a trait the two of you 
share,"
I said wryly.</P>

<P>"Could be," Elsie said.  "Seriously 
Tom, Daria's
a good girl,<BR>
don't screw this one up."</P>

<P>"I 
think I've already have," I muttered.</P>

<P>"How, from everything 
I've heard you've been a font of<BR>
moderation."</P>

<P>"I went out 
with her in the first place."</P>

<P>"Huh?"</P>

<P>I stared at 
Elsie a long moment before answering, "Jane."
I<BR>
finally 
said.</P>

<P>"Jane Lane?  What about her?"</P>

<P>"Daria is 
intensely loyal to Jane, there's no question
in my mind<BR>
that if 
she had to choose between me or Jane she'd pick Jane."</P>

<P>"But 
she did pick you," Elsie protested.</P>

<P>"And she's felt guilty 
about it ever since.  She probably
thinks<BR>
our relationship is 
tainted because it nearly cost her 
Jane's<BR>
friendship."</P>

<P>"Damn, now that's some 
friendship."</P>

<P>"Yeah, I get the impression that Daria was in a 
pretty
dark place<BR>
when her family moved to Lawndale and that Jane 
was the first<BR>
good thing to happen to her in a long 
time."</P>

<P>"So all that exquisite psychobabble means what 
exactly?"</P>

<P>"It means that Daria's been looking for excuses to 
bolt
from our<BR>
relationship from day one.  That's why I've gone 
out of my way
to<BR>
try and be as supportive as 
possible."</P>

<P>"Which she generally takes the wrong 
way."</P>

<P>I sighed, "Yeah."</P>

<P>"Well, all of this does raise 
an excellent question."</P>

<P>"What's that?"</P>

<P>"If she is 
just looking for an excuse to bail why don't
you 
let<BR>
her?"</P>

<P>"Because I think that would be a mistake," I 
quietly
said.</P>

<P>"And why is that...you're in love with her, 
aren't you?"</P>

<P>I nodded, "It's a definite 
possibility."</P>

<P>"This is new territory for you isn't 
it?"</P>

<P>"Pretty much."</P>

<P>"Damn, you're in love with Daria, 
and she's looking to
break up<BR>
with you because she feels guilty 
about how the two of you hooked<BR>
up.  Damn Tom, your love life 
never fails to entertain."</P>

<P>"I'm so glad to hear that," I 
grumbled.  "Do
you think I should<BR>
sell the rights to MTV as the 
basis for a new show?"</P>

<P>"You know, that's a really good idea. 
I bet you'd make
a whole<BR>
bunch of money."</P>

<P>"Oh just shut 
the hell up Elsie, if you don't have anything<BR>
constructive to 
say..."</P>

<P>"Actually I've had a lot of constructive things to 
say,
big<BR>
brother, and I hope you've been paying 
attention."</P>

<P>"Yeah, you're right, I'm sorry 
Elsie."</P>

<P>"You're forgiven, you just owe me some cookies, you 
ate
most of<BR>
these."</P>

<P>"Like you were going to, Ms. 
Eats-like-a-bird."</P>

<P>"At least I won't weight three hundred 
pounds when I'm
twenty."</P>

<P>"Hey, I work out," I 
protested.</P>

<P>"Yeah, right changing the channel doesn't 
count."</P>

<P>"All right, I'll prove it.  Let's arm wrestle, right 
here,
right<BR>
now."  I placed my arm on the table as a 
challenge.</P>

<P>"Tom, what the hell are you doing?"  Elsie 
asked
as she started<BR>
to laugh.</P>

<P>"Challenging you to a game 
of arm wrestling?"  I
hesitantly said.</P>

<P>"Do you remember what 
happened the last time you challenged
me to<BR>
play a 
game?"</P>

<P>"That was different," I countered, "Twister
is a game 
of finesse;<BR>
arm wrestling is a test of brute 
strength."</P>

<P>"Put your arm down, Tom, before you embarrass 
yourself."</P>

<P>"Chicken," I said as I put down my 
arm.</P>

<P>"Believe what you want tough guy, I'm going you a 
favor."
 Elsie<BR>
stood up.</P>

<P>"Where are you going?"  I 
asked.</P>

<P>"Contrary to what you might think I do have a life 
outside
of<BR>
listening to you moan about your love 
life."</P>

<P>"You could have fooled me."</P>

<P>"Oh bite 
me."</P>

<P>"Gee, a life spent in exclusive prep schools and 
'bite
me' is the<BR>
best you can do?"</P>

<P>"Ok then, how about 
'kiss my ass, elder brother'.  I'm
going to go<BR>
read about Carl 
Sandburg."</P>

<P>"Enjoy."</P>

<P>"I'm sure I won't."  Else started 
to walk out of
the kitchen. <BR>
"Oh, and Tom, good luck, you're 
going to need it."</P>

<P>"Thanks Elsie."  I stared at the empty 
kitchen, then
at the plate<BR>
of cookies.  I grabbed the plate and 
walked up to my room.</P>

<P>&lt;Jane&gt;</P>

<P>I knew my day was 
in trouble when I saw the look on Daria's
face<BR>
as she walked up 
to meet me on our way to school.  Now I'm sure<BR>
most people would 
say 'what expression?', but I'm an artist. 
I can<BR>
spot the subtle 
differences between hues, Daria's face is no<BR>
different.  You can 
convey a lot of depth with just shades of<BR>
gray.  I think Daria 
would appreciate that metaphor, but I've<BR>
never told it to her. 
Anyway, on that day her face was telling
me<BR>
one thing, Tom, and 
it wasn't good.</P>

<P>"Crap," I muttered, "This is not going to 
be
fun."  It wasn't<BR>
that Daria and Tom dating really got to me, 
but it did...rankle
a<BR>
little.  I'd given it a lot of thought, 
obviously, and I was<BR>
convinced that Tom and I had been close to 
breaking up without<BR>
any outside help.  I also recognized how well 
matched the two
of<BR>
them are.  I guess I just wish that they 
could've kept their<BR>
hormones in check for at least another week 
to give Tom and I
a<BR>
chance to break up properly.</P>

<P>I 
sighed, "Not like that would have changed anything.
 I 
still<BR>
would have suspected they were cheating on me.  Oh well, 
it's
all<BR>
in the past, besides it could be worse, Tom could be 
going out<BR>
with Kevin or something," I shuddered.  As I was 
thinking
about<BR>
these pleasant topics Daria walked right past me, 
heading for<BR>
school.</P>

<P>"Hey Daria!"  I called out, "wait up 
for me."</P>

<P>Daria stopped and turned around, "Oh sorry, Jane.  I 
didn't
see you<BR>
standing there."</P>

<P>"Yea, because I'm sure a 
master of camouflage.  Last night's
date<BR>
with Tom didn't go 
well?"  It's never worth it to try and
coax<BR>
things out of Daria; 
beating it out of her is the more 
effective<BR>
approach.</P>

<P>"How'd you guess?"</P>

<P>"Well, 
judging from the look on your face it was either
that or<BR>
your 
parents gave Quinn your room for use as a closet."</P>

<P>"My life 
is an open book.  Yes, Tom and I had a 
fight
last<BR>
night."</P>

<P>"About what?"</P>

<P>"It's 
nothing..."</P>

<P>"Daria, you and I both know you're lying.  Out 
with it."</P>

<P>Daria sighed, "For some reason I mentioned I'd 
tried wearing<BR>
contacts and Tom asked if he could see me wearing 
them."</P>

<P>I groaned, "Tom you can be a monumental jackass,"
I 
thought to<BR>
myself.  "And you took this request in the good 
humored manner
it<BR>
was made correct."</P>

<P>"Well no," Daria 
admitted.</P>

<P>"Of course not," I thought, "You reacted in
the 
worst possible<BR>
way which put Tom on the defensive, and after that 
everything<BR>
either of you said only made matters worse."  Daria 
could
be so<BR>
predictable at times.  "So, what's the damage?"  I 
asked
her.</P>

<P>"We broke up.  For good this time I 
think."</P>

<P>That was something different, but not totally 
unexpected, I
think<BR>
Daria really thought she and Tom really had 
broken up in the<BR>
past.  Tom just saw things differently most 
times.  "Oh really?"
<BR>
Was all I managed to say.</P>

<P>"Yeah," 
Daria said.  "Last night I was so mad
at Tom I couldn't<BR>
even 
remember what the argument was about."</P>

<P>"That does sound 
pretty pissed off," I agreed.  "Where
the hell<BR>
is she going with 
this?"  I wondered to myself.</P>

<P>"So I was thinking about this 
afterwards when I realized
what<BR>
really bothered 
me."</P>

<P>"She's going to say her parents," I thought with
a flash 
of<BR>
insight.</P>

<P>"Tom and I have a relationship like my 
parents,"
Daria said<BR>
sourly.</P>

<P>"Bingo," I thought.  Not 
that it was very hard to
deduce the<BR>
problem.  Who isn't afraid of 
becoming their parents?  I know
I'm<BR>
scared to death of becoming 
my folks.  Not that I regret the<BR>
freedom they give me, but their 
choices of subjects, as Quinn<BR>
might say, ew.</P>

<P>"I love my 
parents, after a fashion," Daria continued,
"but I've<BR>
always 
promised myself I'd never get into a relationship like<BR>
theirs, 
it's just not healthy."</P>

<P>"C'mon Daria, a little disagreement 
is healthy."</P>

<P>"Jane, how many times have Tom and I 'broken up' 
since
we started<BR>
going out?"</P>

<P>I shrugged, "I don't know, I 
haven't been keeping track."</P>

<P>"My point exactly, if all we do 
is fight, break-up and
reconcile<BR>
why are we still going out? 
Wouldn't it just be easier to stay<BR>
broken up?"</P>

<P>I must 
admit she did have a point.  Of course I'd always thought<BR>
those 
two were go to stay together, Daria's so stubbornly loyal<BR>
that I 
figured it's take a massive act of stupidity on Tom's part<BR>
to 
wreck things.  "Well I guess that's that huh?"</P>

<P>"Yeah, and I'm 
sorry."</P>

<P>"What?  Run that by me again."</P>

<P>"I nearly 
destroyed our friendship over a relationship
that<BR>
didn't even 
last a year."</P>

<P>"Oh please, that's old news Daria, I don't want 
to hear
any<BR>
apologies from you about that ever again.  Save your 
apologies<BR>
for future screw ups."</P>

<P>"Your faith in me is 
overwhelming."</P>

<P>I shrugged, "Hey, we all make mistakes from 
time to time.
 So, how<BR>
does it feel to be a single woman 
again?"</P>

<P>It was Daria's turn to shrug, "What sort of response 
are
you<BR>
looking for?"</P>

<P>"Don't feel much either way 
huh?"</P>

<P>"That's about it."</P>

<P>"Any regrets, bitter 
feelings, revenge fantasies?"
 I asked as we<BR>
walked into the 
school.</P>

<P>Daria shook her head, "Not really, except maybe a 
vague
feeling<BR>
I'm making a mistake."</P>

<P>"Oh really, you make 
a mistake?  Do tell."</P>

<P>"It's nothing, forget I said 
anything."</P>

<P>"Oh no you don't.  Talk, Morgendorffer."  There 
was
no way I was<BR>
going to let her off the hook that 
easily.</P>

<P>"It's just, I don't know, part of me kind of wants 
to
get back<BR>
together with Tom, but then I think about all the 
work required<BR>
and that we were probably going to break up in a 
couple of months<BR>
anyway when we go to college, so why 
bother?"</P>

<P>"It's good to know that this romantic entanglement 
hasn't
dulled<BR>
your razor-keen apathy," I said as we came to a 
stop in front
of<BR>
my locker.  I was pleasantly surprised to see 
Ryan, my current<BR>
beau, waiting for me there.</P>

<P>"Hi Daria, 
hello Jane," he said cheerfully before
giving me a<BR>
hug. 
Different people are good at different things, and Ryan
was<BR>
a 
good hugger, a skill he liked to share.  He even tried to 
hug<BR>
Daria once.  I'm still amazed he survived that.</P>

<P>I 
kissed him on the cheek, "Hello yourself.  What 
brings
you<BR>
here?"</P>

<P>"It's a funny story, I was walking down 
the street and
the truant<BR>
officer told me I had to go to school, 
so I figured if I had to<BR>
spend the day here I might as well spend 
it with my girlfriend."
<BR>
He leaned over and kissed me; he's also 
a good kisser, a talent<BR>
he has not shared with Daria.</P>

<P>"I 
like the way you think theater boy," I said happily.
 Signing<BR>
up 
for the theater was one of the smartest decisions I've made
in<BR>
a 
long time, and not because of the extra time I got to spend<BR>
with 
Mr. O'Neill.  Ryan's a fun guy and we were both enjoying<BR>
seeing 
each other.  We knew it wouldn't last, but that's not what<BR>
either 
of us was looking for.  We were having fun and that's 
what<BR>
matters.  I looked over and saw Daria walking down the 
hall.</P>

<P>"Hey Daria, where are you going?"  I called 
out.</P>

<P>"To class, I don't want to intrude on your quality 
time."</P>

<P>"Daria, you're not intruding..."</P>

<P>"Yes I was, 
don't worry about it.  I'll see you in class."
Daria<BR>
continued on 
her way down the hall.</P>

<P>"What was that all about?"  Ryan 
asked.</P>

<P>"Oh, Daria and Tom broke up last 
night."</P>

<P>"Really?  Bummer."</P>

<P>"Don't get too emotional 
just yet, those two have a history."</P>

<P>"Combustible 
huh?"</P>

<P>"Oh yeah, but up until now they've always gotten 
back
together."</P>

<P>"You think something's changed?"</P>

<P>I 
shrugged, bumping into Ryan in the process.  "Yeah I
do, but<BR>
I'm 
not sure how it will change things in the end."</P>

<P>"What's 
that?"</P>

<P>I frowned, "this time Daria actually has a good 
reason."</P>

<P>"At the risk of sounding like a broken record, 
what?"</P>

<P>"She thinks her relationship with Tom mirrors her 
parent's<BR>
relationship."</P>

<P>"Whoa, that is one hosed 
relationship."</P>

<P>"My thoughts exactly."</P>

<P>"Want to go 
make out?"  Ryan asked after a long moment
of 
awkward<BR>
silence.</P>

<P>"I thought you'd never ask."  I grabbed 
Ryan by the
hand and<BR>
dragged him into the 
theater.</P>

<P>&lt;Daria&gt;</P>

<P>I spent the rest of the 
morning trying not to think about Tom,
or<BR>
the hickey Jane was 
sporting.  "You're shameless," I
told Jane<BR>
after she sat down 
next to me.</P>

<P>Jane shrugged, "There was time to kill before 
class and
you<BR>
weren't around, what was I supposed to 
do?"</P>

<P>"You two are getting to be as bad as Brittany and 
Kevin,
you know<BR>
that right?"  We both looked over at Kevin and 
Brittany,
who were<BR>
at that moment trying to examine the contents 
of the other's<BR>
stomach.</P>

<P>"Jeez, Daria, there's no need to 
be so hostile, I mean
saying<BR>
something like that is downright 
harsh, even for you."</P>

<P>"You're right, I'm sorry, that was 
uncalled for wasn't
it?"</P>

<P>"Damn straight it 
was."</P>

<P>"Just blame it on Tom."</P>

<P>"All right, I'm always 
a fan of blaming Tom for just about<BR>
anything.  He makes a good 
punching bag and I mean that both<BR>
figuratively and literally. 
Did you ever beat on him?  It's<BR>
great, he doesn't fight 
back."</P>

<P>"I can't say my tastes run that way, but I suspect 
if
I see him<BR>
anytime soon I just might."</P>

<P>"No you 
won't."</P>

<P>I sighed, "No, you're right, I probably 
won't."</P>

<P>"Want me to beat him around for you?"</P>

<P>"I 
don't think that will be necessary."</P>

<P>"You sure?  I'd be more 
than happy to lay the smack down
on his<BR>
punk 
ass."</P>

<P>"Please, never say that, ever again."</P>

<P>"What, 
you'd don't think I'm down with the lingo?"</P>

<P>"You can be down 
with whatever you want, but you sound
stupid<BR>
saying 
it."</P>

<P>"Ok, point well taken, I'll shut up now."</P>

<P>Class 
started then, cutting off any further conversation on
the<BR>
topic. 
For the rest of the morning Jane and I didn't speak much.<BR>
 Like I 
said, I didn't really want to think about Tom and lapsing<BR>
into a 
lecture-induced coma was the best way to keep 
from<BR>
thinking.</P>

<P>At lunch Jane and I ended up sitting with 
Ryan and the rest
of<BR>
the theater crew.  They're not bad people, 
though Mike is<BR>
something of an ass, Greg is a true oddball, Ann's 
friendly with<BR>
Quinn for some reason, and Wylie is, well, 
Wylie.</P>

<P>Dave was the person to sit down at the table next to 
me.  "Hey<BR>
guys guess what, my 5.1 recording gear arrived from 
Germany<BR>
yesterday.  We can try it out at that bandconcert next 
week."</P>

<P>"Whoa, slow down there taper-boy, what the hell are 
you
talking<BR>
about?"  Jane asked.</P>

<P>"I ordered a special set 
of microphones and this really
cool box<BR>
that records 5.1 surround 
sound.  It's really nifty, it's got
a<BR>
pair of omnis and a pair of 
figure 8 mics and then the processor<BR>
calculates the center 
channel..."</P>

<P>"In English, please."</P>

<P>"If you've got a 
5.1 receiver the tapes will really smoke."</P>

<P>"And how much did 
this little toy cost you?"</P>

<P>"Oh, around 8 grand or so, buying 
direct from Germany
is so much<BR>
cheaper than buying in the 
States."</P>

<P>"Ok then, taper-boy shut the hell up.  We don't need 
to
be<BR>
reminded that you burn money to stay warm in the 
winter."</P>

<P>"But I wasn't..." Dave protested, "I just 
thought
the guys would<BR>
want to hear about the new gear I'm going 
to be using."</P>

<P>"I know I did," Ryan said 
cheerfully.</P>

<P>"See, just because you're not a geek doesn't mean 
I can't
talk<BR>
about geeky things."</P>

<P>"Ann, Daria, back me up 
here," Jane said.</P>

<P>"Oh no, I'm staying out of this, I learned 
a long time
ago not to<BR>
get into this debate," Ann said, clutching 
Mike's arm.</P>

<P>I really did not feel like talking just then, 
especially in
front<BR>
of this group, "Uhm, I have to go to the 
restroom, excuse
me."  I<BR>
stood up and walked out of the 
cafeteria.  Once in the hall I<BR>
debated where to go.  Obviously I 
didn't really have to use the<BR>
bathroom, but I also didn't want to 
talk to anyone, Jane<BR>
included.  I settled on the library.  Jane 
would figure I'd go
to<BR>
the roof, but since she'd know that I knew 
that she'd go the<BR>
bathroom, since that was my stated destination, 
and nominally
the<BR>
last place anyone not wanting to be found would 
go.  The library<BR>
seemed like a nice compromise, plus Jane never 
went into the<BR>
library.  I took a copy of "A Bright Shining Lie" 
off
of a<BR>
shelf at random and settled into a chair.  I had hardly 
started<BR>
to read when I felt a hand tap me on the shoulder, I 
looked up,<BR>
expecting to see Jane, and was surprised to instead 
see Ann.</P>

<P>"What do you want?"  I asked her.</P>

<P>"I wanted 
to talk to you.  It looked like you wanted to
talk 
to<BR>
someone."</P>

<P>"I wouldn't be too sure of that," I 
grumbled.</P>

<P>"Jane seemed pretty sure you did," she 
countered.</P>

<P>"Then why isn't she here?"</P>

<P>"Because, and I 
quote, 'I'm trying to enjoy my lunch and
I'll get<BR>
all the details 
from her after school. But if you want to go try<BR>
and talk to her 
be my guest, it's your funeral."</P>

<P>"How'd you find me?"   I 
asked as I digested Jane's
statement.</P>

<P>"You can blame Jane for 
that as well.  She said you'd
be in the<BR>
library because she knew 
you'd know she'd know you wouldn't be
on<BR>
the roof, and you also 
wouldn't be in the bathroom because she<BR>
knew you'd know she'd 
look there because it was the least obvious<BR>
place, which left the 
library because she knew you know she'd<BR>
never come here..." And 
paused, "Great, I just confused
myself<BR>
saying that and I even 
drew a diagram."  She held up a scrap
of<BR>
paper with a lot of 
scribbles written on it."</P>

<P>"That's ok, I guess I didn't really 
need to know after
all."  The<BR>
explanation made my head swim about 
as badly as ramble from<BR>
Quinn, no wonder the two liked to hang 
out together.</P>

<P>"So, what's bothering you?"</P>

<P>"Who said 
I'd talk to you about it, or anything else 
for
that<BR>
matter?"</P>

<P>"It's about Tom isn't 
it?"</P>

<P>"What did Jane tell you about that?"  I demanded.
 The 
thought of<BR>
Jane talking about my personal life with a person who 
was a<BR>
virtual stranger to me was more than a little 
upsetting.</P>

<P>"Whoa there, Jane didn't tell me 
anything."</P>

<P>"Then how?"</P>

<P>"Quinn told me all about you 
and Tom, well Jane did tell
me some<BR>
things, but that was mostly 
to explain why she joined the tech<BR>
crew way back."</P>

<P>"Oh," 
Quinn talking about me behind my back was a
little 
more<BR>
tolerable, though not by much.  "And just why did Quinn 
tell
you<BR>
this?"</P>

<P>Ann shrugged, "It's how we work on 
accents, she tells
me the<BR>
latest gossip in the accent of my 
choice."</P>

<P>"You're a veritable Henry Higgins," I muttered, 
"You
know Quinn's<BR>
perfectly capable of doing that without any 
help.  Accents are<BR>
just like another form of accessory to 
her."</P>

<P>"I know that, but the trick is getting her to speak 
with
an<BR>
accent in character, the gossiping puts her at 
ease.</P>

<P>"Plus it gives you easy access to all the latest 
dirt,"
I pointed<BR>
out.</P>

<P>"There is that too," she 
admitted.</P>

<P>I sighed, "Well you'll be hearing this soon enough 
then.
 I broke<BR>
up with Tom, who is as you know my boyfriend, last 
night."</P>

<P>"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."</P>

<P>"It's for the 
best really, there was no future in it."</P>

<P>"Still, that's too 
bad.  How are you doing?"</P>

<P>"Me?  I'm fine, in fact I'd be 
doing better if a certain
nosy<BR>
junior would leave me 
alone."</P>

<P>Ann smiled, "Sorry, I've just always wanted to get 
to
know you a<BR>
little better."</P>

<P>"Yeah, sure," I 
scoffed.</P>

<P>"I'm serious, I've always wanted to know who exactly 
you
were and<BR>
why you acted like you were so damn superior to 
everyone else."</P>

<P>"Oh really."</P>

<P>"Yeah, imagine my 
surprise when I found out you were no
better<BR>
than me," the bell 
rang, "Bye Daria."</P>

<P>"Yeah, bye," I told the departing teen. 
"Well
that was<BR>
different," I muttered to myself as I walked to my 
next class.</P>

<P>On my way there I ran into Jodie and Mack, no not 
literally.</P>

<P>"Hey Daria," Jodie said, "How are you 
doing
today?"</P>

<P>"I can't complain to much," I said 
noncommittally
Of all the<BR>
people to talk to the perfect couple 
were low on the list.</P>

<P>"I, uh, hear that you and Tom had a bit 
of a falling out."</P>

<P>"Is everyone so bored they have nothing 
better to do but
talk<BR>
about me?"</P>

<P>"Well yeah, we are," 
Mack answered.</P>

<P>Jodie elbowed him in the ribs, "No, that's not 
it at all.
 We're<BR>
just interested in how you're doing."  She 
glared at Mack,
daring<BR>
him to contradict her.</P>

<P>"Your 
concern is touching, but I'm fine."</P>

<P>"But you and Tom did 
break up right?"</P>

<P>"Yes, we did."</P>

<P>"And you're feeling 
fine?"</P>

<P>"It's not the end of the world you know," I 
pointed
out.</P>

<P>"Well no but still it is pretty big news for 
you."</P>

<P>I shrugged, "I think I'm the arbiter of what is big 
to
me," Jodie<BR>
meant well I'm sure, but when I don't want to talk 
about<BR>
something I mean it.</P>

<P>"Well if you're sure," Jodie 
hesitantly said.</P>

<P>"I am," I replied curtly.  "Look, Jodie, 
I'm
not about to do<BR>
anything rash if that's what's bothering 
you."</P>

<P>"You sure?"</P>

<P>"Yes, I'm fine."</P>

<P>"Ok, then 
would you be interested in helping me out with
a<BR>
recycling 
drive?"</P>

<P>I smirked, "Very clever, I have a built-in excuse 
with
Tom, but<BR>
if I use it then I'm not fine and you can press me 
for<BR>
information.  However, if I really am fine then I don't have 
any<BR>
excuses for not helping you out with this recycling drive. 
Quite<BR>
the Gordian Knot you've constructed for me."</P>

<P>"Uh, 
thanks."</P>

<P>"Of course there was a very simple solution to the 
Gordian
knot,<BR>
cut it in two; just like I can tell you that I'm 
not interested<BR>
in your recycling drive, so my emotional stability 
is<BR>
irrelevant."</P>

<P>Jodie sighed, "So there's no way you'd 
help out with a
recycling<BR>
drive?"</P>

<P>I shook my head, "I'm 
afraid not."</P>

<P>"Well, it was worth a shot.  Good luck with Tom, 
Daria."
 Jodie<BR>
waved and walked off.</P>

<P>"Uh sorry about 
that," Mack apologized.  "She's
just been working<BR>
extra hard on 
this recycling thing.  I think she actually cares<BR>
about this 
cause."</P>

<P>"You're just trying to make me feel guilty and 
change
my mind."</P>

<P>"A little," Mack admitted, "but mostly to 
try
and make sure I<BR>
don't end up doing most of the 
work."</P>

<P>"Why don't you just get the football team to help 
out?"</P>

<P>"Like I said, I don't want to end up doing most of 
the
work."</P>

<P>"Oh, I'm sorry," I hesitated for a moment, a 
plan
beginning to<BR>
form.  "Why don't you suggest to Jodie that she 
ask Ann Raeder<BR>
for help."</P>

<P>"Who's that?"  Mack asked, 
frowning slightly.</P>

<P>"She's a junior, a real over achiever like 
Jodie, I'm
sure she's<BR>
on the look out for ways to enrich her 
college applications."</P>

<P>"Ok great I'll do that."  Mack paused, 
"Wait
a second, how do you<BR>
know a junior?"</P>

<P>I shrugged, 
"She knows my sister, don't worry, she's not
a<BR>
fashion-ite, she 
has a functioning brain."</P>

<P>"And you're sure she'll agree to 
help out?"</P>

<P>Inwardly I smiled, "Positive."</P>

<P>"Great, 
I'll go tell Jodie, thanks Daria."</P>

<P>"Don't mention it," I said 
casually as Mack set off
after Jodie. <BR>
I congratulated myself on 
my ingenuity; not only had I ducked<BR>
Jodie's latest crusade, but 
also I'd place Ann right in the<BR>
crosshairs.  I knew she'd agree 
because she was so neurotic about<BR>
her college application, and if 
she was involved it was a sure<BR>
bet she'd drag along her boyfriend 
Mike.  Mike would in turn get<BR>
the rest of the theater techs 
involved, which would include Jane.<BR>
 I was feeling a little 
spiteful, and figured Jane needed a<BR>
little punishment for 
pointing Ann in my direction.  Yes, it was<BR>
an extremely petty 
thing to do, but it was also pretty fun, and
I<BR>
was sure that if 
Jane ever found out who was behind her forcible<BR>
volunteerism I'd 
get my comeuppance.</P>

<P>The rest of the school day passed without 
incident.  I walked<BR>
home by myself; Jane had a prior engagement 
with Ryan.  As I got<BR>
near the house I saw an all too familiar car 
parked on the<BR>
street.  "Oh hell," I muttered, of all the 
unpleasant
tasks I<BR>
could think of, talking to Tom was high on the 
list.  I turned<BR>
around and started to walk away from the house. 
"Maybe I'll<BR>
spend my afternoon in the library," I 
thought.</P>

<P>"Hey Daria, hold up!"  Tom shouted.</P>

<P>I was 
busted, I turned around to face Tom, "What do 
you
want<BR>
Sloane?"</P>

<P>"Well, I'd like to talk to you, if at 
all possible."</P>

<P>"And you won't leave until we do, 
right?"</P>

<P>"I brought a tent with me," He offered.</P>

<P>"Ok, 
talk," I said, relenting a little.</P>

<P>"Well first of all it goes 
without saying that I'm sorry.
 I<BR>
shouldn't have pushed the 
contact thing like I did.  I'd also<BR>
like to try and convince you 
to think about putting this behind<BR>
you and maybe the two of us 
getting back together."</P>

<P>"No dice Tom," I said 
evenly.</P>

<P>"What?  No dice, what do you mean by 
that?"</P>

<P>"It means we're broken up, you can move along to 
someone
new."</P>

<P>"Daria, what's this all about?  You can't still 
be upset
about<BR>
the contact thing."</P>

<P>I shook my head, "No 
it's not about the contacts, it's
about<BR>
where they fit into the 
big picture."</P>

<P>"Huh?"</P>

<P>"Tom, we're always fighting, 
breaking up and then getting
back<BR>
together.  Is that anywhere 
near healthy?"</P>

<P>"Who's to say?"  Tom countered.  "We're 
still
feeling each other<BR>
out, finding where the boundaries are. 
I'm sure as time goes
on<BR>
we'll work that stuff out.  Don't let a 
little spat scare you<BR>
Daria."</P>

<P>"It's not that..." I 
trailed off.  I didn't want
to admit this to<BR>
Tom, telling Jane 
was hard enough.</P>

<P>"Then what is it?"  Tom asked.  "I can't 
fix
it if I don't know<BR>
what it is."</P>

<P>I sighed, the only 
way to get rid of him was to tell him, "We're<BR>
turning into my 
parents, Tom, and when I was little I promised<BR>
myself I'd never 
be involved in that sort of relationship."</P>

<P>"And there's no 
way we could change that?"</P>

<P>"Tom do you have any idea how many 
marriage counselors,
romantic<BR>
getaways, self-help books, seminars 
and workshops my parents have<BR>
been to?"</P>

<P>"I'm guessing the 
answer is more than two."</P>

<P>"Don't make jokes Tom.  They've 
been to more than I can
remember,<BR>
and none of it has helped, they 
still argue and fight and badly<BR>
as they always have."</P>

<P>"So 
what, your parents fight, big deal, just because your
parents<BR>
do 
something there's no reason to think you'll duplicate 
that<BR>
behavior."</P>

<P>"But we already are," I said angrily. 
"Isn't
that what we're<BR>
doing right now?  You want to get back 
together.  Well I'm<BR>
breaking the cycle, this is the last time, 
it's over for good."</P>

<P>"Oh come on Daria, what do you expect, 
that a relationship
is<BR>
always going to be sweetness and 
light?"</P>

<P>"No, but we still fight too much," I 
insisted.</P>

<P>"And whose fault is that?  I'm not the person who 
overreacts
to<BR>
every minor speed bump we've faced.  You're the 
person with the<BR>
issues."</P>

<P>"What the hell does that mean?" 
I demanded as I
tried my best to<BR>
keep my voice 
level.</P>

<P>"Just that with your fears about intimacy and this 
apparent<BR>
neurosis about your parents I think I've shown a 
tremendous<BR>
amount of patience and understanding in keeping this 
relationship<BR>
going.  You've been so incredibly immature that 
maybe you should<BR>
just grow up and realize that the only problems 
we have are all<BR>
really your problems!"</P>

<P>"Why you arrogant, 
patronizing asshole, half the time
it's your<BR>
'I know what's best 
for you' attitude that's the cause of the<BR>
fight!  So don't you 
even think about saying this is all in my<BR>
head."  I was really 
pissed off, and with good reason; Tom
was<BR>
laying the blame for 
all our problems at my feet.</P>

<P>"Well what do you expect, you 
come to me looking for validation<BR>
for your apathy and I don't 
give you that because I don't think<BR>
it's in your best interest. 
If that makes me patronizing then
so<BR>
be it, but I don't want to 
sit by and watch you crawl into a<BR>
shell.  You're a less enjoyable 
person to be around when you're<BR>
busy shutting people 
out."</P>

<P>I very nearly hit him, "Tom leave 
now."</P>

<P>"What?"</P>

<P>"You heard me, I'm not going to stand 
here and have you
dictate<BR>
to me how I need to act.  Excuse me for 
not conforming to what<BR>
your ideal girlfriend is.  Now get the 
hell away from me."
<BR>
Inwardly I was seething.  Tom had said I 
wasn't good enough for<BR>
him.  That was all it took, the resolve 
crystallized in my mind,<BR>
I spun around and walked into my house, 
slamming the door behind<BR>
me.</P>

<P>&lt;Tom&gt;</P>

<P>"Daria, 
wait!" I shouted out after her.  "That
wasn't what I<BR>
meant..." 
the door slammed.  "Damn!" I shouted.
 The exchange had<BR>
not gone 
as I planned.  I meant to apologize about the contacts,<BR>
make a 
peace offering or two and that would be that.  Accusations<BR>
about 
being like her parents were something totally unexpected.
<BR>
It 
caught me off guard and I lashed back without thinking.</P>

<P>"You 
dumb bastard," I cursed at myself.  "Tom,
you've done a lot<BR>
of 
stupid things in your life, and this one ranks right up<BR>
there." 
I knew Daria would react badly to what I was saying,
but<BR>
I said 
it anyway.  True to form the clouds in the sky acted on<BR>
their 
threat of rain and it started to pour.  I ran for my car<BR>
but 
stopped short.  "Forget it, embrace the clich&Egrave;,"
I thought 
as<BR>
the rain pounded down on my head.  I stood there, trying 
to<BR>
figure out what to do next.  Going up to the door was out 
since<BR>
Sloanes do not cause a scene.  Of course just standing 
there was<BR>
also a scene of a sort, what sort of moron stands in 
the middle<BR>
of a downpour without a jacket on?  That certainly 
wasn't<BR>
anything a Sloane would do.  And while I never really felt 
an<BR>
obligation to do something just because of my family name, 
my<BR>
fortunes were inexorably linked to the family's so 
minimizing
any<BR>
chance of a run in with the police, and I'm sure 
Daria would have<BR>
called them if had tried to talk to her, was 
always a good idea.</P>

<P>The raindrops running down my neck broke 
my reverie.  "Clich&Egrave;s
be<BR>
damned, getting wet sucks," I 
said aloud.  I got into the
car and<BR>
drove off.  AsI aimlessly 
drove through the streets of Lawndale<BR>
I continued to debate with 
myself what to do next.</P>

<P>"I could just go home," I thought, 
"but I don't
really want to do<BR>
that right now. I'm just not in 
the mood to explain to Mom why<BR>
I'm soaked."  The pizza joint we 
hung out at flashed past
and I<BR>
briefly considered stopping in for 
a slice, but decided against<BR>
that as well, too many 
memories.</P>

<P>I kept on driving along, I don't quite know why I 
was driving,<BR>
but at the time it seemed like the thing to do.  I 
eventually<BR>
came to a stop at my thinking spot just on the 
outskirts of town.<BR>
 It was still raining outside so I stayed in 
the car.  As I sat<BR>
there listening to the rain hitting the roof 
of the car I tried<BR>
to let myself gain some clarity on the 
issue.</P>

<P>"Did I just prove her point?"  I wondered as I ate
a 
piece a<BR>
licorice I kept in my glove box in case of emergency. 
"We
really<BR>
did just have a pretty nasty fight, but then again 
isn't that<BR>
better than just repressing everything?"  I sighed and 
reached<BR>
for another piece of candy.  "It's all so frustrating, 
I
just<BR>
wanted to go out with Daria, not ponder the philosophy of 
dating.
<BR>
And that's the rub since that is what Daria was doing. 
So maybe<BR>
it's time to move on.  It was bound to happen sooner or 
later,<BR>
wasn't it?  Who finds true love in high school after 
all?"</P>

<P>The steering wheel didn't have any answers for me on 
that score.
<BR>
"Damn, I have to talk to someone about this."  The 
question,
of<BR>
course, was who.  I had talked about this with Elsie 
last night<BR>
so she was out.  Daria was probably at Jane's that 
very moment<BR>
which ruled her out.  Not that I would have sought 
out Jane's<BR>
advice, talking to your ex-girlfriend about your 
current<BR>
girlfriend is incredibly awkward.  There wasn't anyone 
at<BR>
Fielding who I felt like talking to about anything minor, 
much<BR>
less something deep like this.</P>

<P>I sighed and rested 
my head on the steering wheel.  There were
no<BR>
good solutions to 
my problems it seemed.  Just them my eyes<BR>
caught sight of a CD 
case lying on the floor of the car.  "Hell,<BR>
why not him?"  I 
asked myself.  "He had some decent
advice for me<BR>
the other time. 
I wonder if he's home?"  I started the car
and<BR>
drove back into 
town.</P>

<P>&lt;Jane&gt;</P>

<P>"Hey Janey," Trent called out, 
"Daria's here."</P>

<P>I sighed, it was pouring rain outside, and 
there was only one<BR>
reason why Daria would walk to my house in a 
storm.  "Dammit<BR>
Tom," I muttered, "Why can't you leave well 
enough alone?"
 I put<BR>
down my paintbrush, "Come on up Daria," I 
shouted. 
I got back to<BR>
work on my painting, a cityscape of 
Lawndale after an acid<BR>
rainstorm and finished a few more details 
before I heard a<BR>
familiar boot tromp outside my door.  "Hey 
Daria," I
said without<BR>
turning around.  "So, he was waiting for 
you at your house?"</P>

<P>"Yeah," was all Daria said.</P>

<P>I 
turned around to look at her; she was wet.  "Jeez, 
Daria,
how<BR>
many times do I have to tell you, use an umbrella."  I 
grabbed
a<BR>
towel from my laundry pile and tossed it at 
her.</P>

<P>"I'll keep that in mind the next time I have a 
romantic
crisis,"<BR>
Daria replied as she dried herself 
off.</P>

<P>"All right, spill the dirt, how'd it go down?" 
Daria
sat down on<BR>
my bed, letting the towel fall to the floor. 
"What the hell,
I<BR>
had to change those sheets anyway," I thought 
to myself.</P>

<P>"Like you said he was waiting for me when I got 
home from
school.<BR>
 We had another fight, I slammed a door in his 
face and it's now<BR>
definitely over."</P>

<P>"Oh come on, I think 
I deserve to know all the juicy details,
not<BR>
the Reader's Digest 
version."  The name of the game at that
point<BR>
was Playing Daria. 
She wanted to talk, but her ingrained<BR>
reticence meant you had to 
coax the full story out of her.</P>

<P>"He first he apologized for 
last night."</P>

<P>"As well he should have," I said, mostly to 
fill
space.  "And you<BR>
replied how?"</P>

<P>"I said it didn't 
matter because I thought we should stay
broken<BR>
up."</P>

<P>"Ah 
yes. Because every rational person returns an apology
with 
a<BR>
verbal slap in the face."</P>

<P>"Well at least I was about to 
break up with him."</P>

<P>"Daria, do you really want to bring that 
up right now?"</P>

<P>I watched Daria's face sag, "No I guess 
not."</P>

<P>"So what happened next?"</P>

<P>He said I was being 
immature and that any problems I thought
the<BR>
two of us had were 
really my problems."</P>

<P>Now I know that Tom has issues, mostly 
with his parents oddly<BR>
enough, but I must admit there was a ring 
of truth to what Tom<BR>
apparently said.  Of course I wasn't going 
to say that right<BR>
then.  Besides you don't call your best friend 
immature, at least<BR>
at a moment like that.  "I'm sure you took 
that well,"
I said<BR>
sardonically.</P>

<P>"I called him a 
patronizing ass."</P>

<P>"Atta girl."</P>

<P>"It doesn't end 
there," she said sadly.</P>

<P>"Oh ho, more dirt, please tell 
me."</P>

<P>"He said I look to him for validation of my apathy, 
and
that he<BR>
thinks I'm a better person when I'm not so 
withdrawn."</P>

<P>"Well damn, there it is," I thought. 
"It's
amazing how little<BR>
Tom's learned about Daria."  I put an 
arm around Daria's<BR>
shoulder.  "Look at it this way, at least he 
didn't make
out with<BR>
your best friend first."  Sure, it was a 
cheap shot, but
Daria's<BR>
a big girl, she can handle it.  After 
all, why should I care who<BR>
Tom dates; Ryan's a much cooler guy, 
better kisser too.</P>

<P>"Thanks goodness for small favors," Daria 
muttered.</P>

<P>"What, no apologies for sticking a dagger in my 
back?"
 I asked<BR>
playfully.</P>

<P>"You said you didn't want me 
to apologize for that any
more,"<BR>
Daria replied with a 
smirk.</P>

<P>"Touche, so what do you say to drowning our 
sorrows
with a slice<BR>
or three, and then spending the evening 
listening to the<BR>
melodious sounds of the Spiral?"</P>

<P>"Yes on 
the pizza no on Spiral.  I'm not so depressed
I want to<BR>
hurt 
myself."</P>

<P>"Oh come on, it'll make you feel 
better."</P>

<P>"Is this the stub your toe to cure a headache school 
of<BR>
medicine?"</P>

<P>"Something like that yes."</P>

<P>"Or is 
it that you have to go and you need a sucker to
keep 
you<BR>
company?"</P>

<P>"There is that too," I admitted.  "But 
don't
you want to spend<BR>
time with your friend?"</P>

<P>"Hey 
Janey, Daria," Trent said as he walked in the
room.</P>

<P>"Hi 
Trent, what's up?"  I asked.</P>

<P>"Nothing just, I just thought 
somebody was talking about
Spiral."</P>

<P>"Oh, you heard that?" 
Daria asked, visibly hesitant.</P>

<P>"Heard what?"</P>

<P>"Our 
conversation about Spiral?"</P>

<P>"Nah, I just have a sense 
whenever people are talking
about<BR>
Mystik Spiral, that's all." 
There are times when I wish
Trent<BR>
wouldn't say stupid stuff like 
that, but it's part of his charm.</P>

<P>"I'm trying to get Daria to 
come to the show tonight,
want to<BR>
help me convince 
her?"</P>

<P>Trent shrugged, "Sure, you should go Daria, it'll be 
cool."
 He<BR>
flashed thumbs up.</P>

<P>"Wow, that was convincing," 
Daria said.</P>

<P>"It'll be fun Daria, besides what else are you 
going to
do<BR>
tonight?  Mope over Tom."</P>

<P>"I suppose," Daria 
admitted.</P>

<P>"What happened to Tom?"  Trent 
asked.</P>

<P>"Daria broke up with him yesterday."</P>

<P>"Oh, 
ok."</P>

<P>"Is that all?"  Daria asked, a hint of anger 
tingeing
her voice.</P>

<P>"Uh yeah," Trent replied with a slightly 
startled
expression on<BR>
his face.  I could see where Daria was 
coming from.  She'd<BR>
probably had to deal with all sorts of people 
offering advice,<BR>
condolences, and other assorted crap thanks to 
the grapevine.
 On<BR>
the other hand with Trent if it doesn't 
intersect directly with<BR>
his little world it doesn't really 
register.</P>

<P>"Oh what the hell, maybe I'll get some manner of 
cranial
injury<BR>
and forget about how much this all 
sucks."</P>

<P>"That's the spirit," I said, my voice dripping 
with
sarcasm.  No<BR>
one can reluctantly agree with quite the same 
panache as Daria.</P>

<P>"Cool, we're debuting a new song tonight, 
'Sub-terrestrial<BR>
Homesick Blues 52 and 10,' it's a Dylan 
tribute."</P>

<P>"Can you just kill me now and be done with it?" 

Daria asked.</P>

<P>"No dice, if I have to sit through it so do 
you.  Now
let's go,<BR>
we don't want to be late."  I dragged Daria 
out of the room
and<BR>
we followed Trent down to his 
car.</P>

<P>&lt;Quinn&gt;</P>

<P>I walked into the library and 
started to look for my study
date. <BR>
Yes I know, the mighty Quinn 
Morgendorffer going into the library<BR>
voluntarily to study on a 
Friday night, whatever is the world<BR>
coming to?  Go ahead, laugh 
it up.  There, got it out of your<BR>
system, because I do have a 
good explanation.  The library is<BR>
nice and quiet, plus no one I 
know would ever go into the library<BR>
so I don't have to worry 
about, uh, unwanted interruptions. <BR>
Besides, it's still a date, 
sure, we're just studying, but it's<BR>
still a date...at least 
that's my story.  I know, it's all<BR>
semantics and really I'm going 
to study instead of a date, but
if<BR>
there's anything my mother's 
taught me it's that life is lived
in<BR>
the semantics, so I was on a 
study date.</P>

<P>"Although study dates imply two people," I 
muttered
to myself,<BR>
"Where is he?"  I wondered as I walked 
through the stacks.
 "He's<BR>
probably downstairs reading some silly 
magazine."  I thought
with<BR>
disgust.  "Never mind the fact that we 
agreed to meet at
the<BR>
circulation desk."</P>

<P>I walked down to 
the musty periodical's basement and started
to<BR>
look around in 
between shelves stacked with old issues of<BR>
"National Geographic" 
and "Consumer Reports."
 I found him<BR>
leafing through an old "Pro 
Audio Review."</P>

<P>"Hey you jerk," I whispered, "What happened
to 
meeting at the<BR>
circulation desk?</P>

<P>Dave Wylie looked up 
from his magazine, "Shoot, you're
right,<BR>
sorry I lost track of 
the time."  He put the magazine back
on the<BR>
shelf, right in front 
of the sign saying not to.  "Ok, let's
do<BR>
this thing."</P>

<P>I 
know what you're thinking and don't even start.  Yes, Dave
and<BR>
I 
went out for a while when he first moved to Lawndale, and 
there<BR>
was that whole David Sorensen issue from last summer, but 
the
two<BR>
aren't related.  Sure, Dave's a nice guy, once you get 
past the<BR>
whole stoner thing.  He's offered me a hit or whatever 
the hell<BR>
it is he does from time to time, and sure I've been a 
little<BR>
curious, but munchies, ewwww, there's just not way I'm 
going to<BR>
do that to myself.  Still, Dave is a nice guy, I mean he 
is<BR>
helping me out.  But he's not David.  David was special; he 
saw<BR>
something in me and helped me realize it was there.  Sure 
he<BR>
didn't go out with me, but then again why should he have? 
He
was<BR>
a college student and I was just an immature little 
high<BR>
schooler, who up until that point had only shown an interest 
in<BR>
fashion and gossip.  Well I was going to show him the next 
time<BR>
we met, cute and deep, that was my goal.  That is if I 
even<BR>
wanted to go out with him, something I wasn't sure about, I 
mean<BR>
he did refuse to go out with me.  And before you ask, no I'm 
not<BR>
going to actually date Dave either.  Stacy asked me that 
during<BR>
the whole steady debacle, and what I told her then still 
holds<BR>
true.  I'm not dating Dave because it would be a bad idea. 
Yes<BR>
he is the richest kid in school, and a popular enough guy 
because<BR>
of it, but it just wouldn't work.  Besides why bother 
going<BR>
steady with someone?  It just leads to trouble.  Look at 
Daria<BR>
and Tom.  Those two are like so right for each other, but 
they<BR>
keep fighting and stuff.  Who wants to put up with 
that?</P>

<P>All this was running through my head as Dave tried to 
explain
the<BR>
assignment we were working on to me. "Hey Quinn, are 
you
even<BR>
paying attention to a word I'm saying?"  He asked 
finally.</P>

<P>"Uh, well, no," I admitted.</P>

<P>"Want to tell me 
what you're thinking about?"</P>

<P>"Daria and Tom's breakup."  Well 
I wasn't going to
say anything<BR>
about David to Dave that would 
be...awkward.</P>

<P>"Since when do you care about Daria's personal 
life?"</P>

<P>"I happen to think that Daria and Tom make a great 
couple.
<BR>
Besides I liked the fact that she was dating, it made 
her seem
a<BR>
little more normal, and not that there was this huge 
rift between<BR>
us.  I mean why else would I admit that she's my 
sister?"</P>

<P>Dave smiled slightly, "Ok, that makes sense," 
he
said in a way<BR>
that did not sound convincing.</P>

<P>"What, 
you don't think that's why?"</P>

<P>"I think that whatever you think 
your motives are is what
they<BR>
are.  But then again if you say 
something enough times you begin<BR>
to believe it.  Right or 
wrong."</P>

<P>"Whatever."  Dave could be really weird at times,
I 
think it's<BR>
because of all the drugs.  "Can we work on this 
assignment<BR>
please?"</P>

<P>"That's what I'm here for."  We got 
back to work
on my history<BR>
assignment, but I felt this aura of 
something unsaid floating<BR>
around us.</P>

<P>I tried to ignore it 
for as long as possible, but it eventually<BR>
became too much,  "So 
what do you think about Daria and Tom<BR>
breaking up?"  I blurted 
out.</P>

<P>Dave sighed and closed his notebook, "I don't think 
it's
really<BR>
my place to say anything.  I don't have much invested 
in either<BR>
of them."</P>

<P>"What does money have to do with any 
of this?"  I
asked,<BR>
confused.</P>

<P>"Not a monetary investment, 
a personal one, they aren't
my<BR>
friends in other 
words."</P>

<P>"What do you mean, you hang out with 
them?"</P>

<P>"Sure I've even helped Tom out with a couple of 
things,
but<BR>
there's a difference between being friendly with 
someone and<BR>
being their friend.  I'm the former opposed to the 
latter with<BR>
your sister and Tom."</P>

<P>"Dave would it kill you 
say anything simply?"</P>

<P>"Fine, I don't care about their 
relationship."</P>

<P>"Not even a little?"</P>

<P>Dave shrugged, 
"Not really, cause it's not my life."
 He rubbed<BR>
the bridge of 
his nose.  He says that's just a holdover from when<BR>
he wore 
glasses on a regular basis.  I think it's just a way for<BR>
him to 
stall when he doesn't know what to say.  "Look, I
don't<BR>
think 
we're going to get much more work done tonight so why don't<BR>
we go 
grab a bite to eat?"</P>

<P>I shrugged, "Sure, why not, this isn't 
due tomorrow."
 I started<BR>
to put my books into my 
backpack.</P>

<P>"Great, there's this new diner that opened up down 
by
Degas<BR>
Street that I've been meaning to check out."</P>

<P>I 
winced; Dave's affinity for greasy spoon diners was not 
one
of<BR>
his finer points.  Once again I blame the drugs.  "That 
sounds<BR>
great."</P>

<P>Dave held the library door open for me, 
"hey, it's the<BR>
twenty-first century, I'm sure they've got a 
low-fat menu."</P>

<P>"If they did you wouldn't go there," I 
groused.</P>

<P>We walked up to Dave's Volkswagen.  "But would I ask 
you
to come<BR>
along with me if they didn't?"  He said as he 
unlocked the<BR>
Beetle.</P>

<P>"They'd better, otherwise you're in 
big trouble.  Do you
have any<BR>
ideas how many carrot sticks I had 
to eat after the last place<BR>
you took me?" I said, letting myself 
into the car.</P>

<P>"You could just do what I do and 
exercise."</P>

<P>"And sweat?  Ewwww."  Some things boys just 
don't
understand.</P>

<P>"Oh fine, but carrot sticks don't give you 
good muscle
tone like<BR>
an hour in the gym does."  It's funny 
really, for a guy who<BR>
claims not to care about appearances I've 
never seen a person<BR>
obsess more about his weight, Tiffany 
excluded of course.  It's<BR>
probably because Dave's father long ago 
lost the battle for his<BR>
waistline.  "What's funny so funny?" 
Dave asked.</P>

<P>I realized I'd been smiling.  "Oh nothing, I was 
just
thinking<BR>
about this out I saw this girl wearing today.  It 
was so two<BR>
seasons ago."  No way in hell I was going to tell Dave 
what
I was<BR>
really thinking about.</P>

<P>"Forget I 
asked."</P>

<P>I leaned back in my seat and enjoyed a small moment 
of personal<BR>
triumph; people could be so easily manipulated.  "Now 
if
I could<BR>
only do the same with Daria and Tom," I 
thought.</P>

<P>&lt;Daria&gt;</P>

<P>I let myself into the house 
after leaving the show early. 
It<BR>
wasn't that I was having a bad 
time, it was nice to hang out with<BR>
Jane again, but just because I 
wasn't in the mood to hear Mystik<BR>
Spiral butcher anymore songs. 
I walked into the kitchen to get
a<BR>
drink and found mom sitting at 
the kitchen table looking over<BR>
some papers and talking into her 
phone.</P>

<P>"Well unless your client really wants to get his 
pants
sued off<BR>
you'll make me a better offer!"  She barked into 
the phone.
 She<BR>
glanced over and saw me enter the room and I 
suppose could see<BR>
something wasn't right by the expression on my 
face.  "Ok,
now<BR>
talk it over with your client then call me back 
tomorrow with<BR>
your real offer."  She turned off the phone and put 
it in
her<BR>
bag.  "Daria, sweetie, is something 
wrong?"</P>

<P>While I was touched by this rare display of maternal 
concern
I<BR>
also didn't want to talk to my mom about Tom.  "I'm 
fine
Mom."</P>

<P>"I'm your mother, Daria.  I know when you're 
lying.  Out
with it,<BR>
or would you rather I ask your 
sister?"</P>

<P>I sighed, Quinn would delight in telling Mom, and 
probably
screw<BR>
it up in the process.  "All right, if you must 
know Tom and
I broke<BR>
up."</P>

<P>"Oh Daria, how awful, sit down 
and tell me all about it."</P>

<P>"There's not much to tell, we had 
one fight too many and
that was<BR>
that," I 
shrugged.</P>

<P>"Daria, you should know that just because you have 
a fight
you<BR>
don't have to break up.  Just look at your father and 
I..."</P>

<P>"I have many times," I snapped, "and that's
why I broke 
up with<BR>
Tom."</P>

<P>"What?  You broke up with Tom because of 
your father and
I?"</P>

<P>"Right, I've spent my whole life watching 
you and dad
bicker,<BR>
squabble, and fight and I don't want that for 
myself."</P>

<P>"Daria, it's not that your father and I don't love 
each
other..."</P>

<P>"As disturbing as it sounds I understand that, 
but still
why<BR>
should I settle for that?"</P>

<P>"So are you 
expecting to find a relationship where 
you
never<BR>
fight?"</P>

<P>I squirmed a little in my seat.  "No, 
but the frequency
with which<BR>
 you and dad fight is 
disturbing."</P>

<P>Mom sighed, "I won't deny that your father and I 
have<BR>
a...confrontational relationship, but we do still love 
each<BR>
other, and we'll figure it out eventually."</P>

<P>"And why 
should I repeat your mistakes?"</P>

<P>"Marrying your father was not 
a mistake Daria, at the
very least<BR>
it gave me you and your 
sister, and I wouldn't trade the two of<BR>
you for anything in the 
world."</P>

<P>"So even if you still had to do it all over again 
you'd
still<BR>
marry Dad?"</P>

<P>"Of course I would.  Daria, look 
at it this way, if something's<BR>
not worth fighting over is it 
really worth having?</P>

<P>"That's disturbing logic."</P>

<P>"What 
I mean is I love your father and I'm not about to
let some<BR>
silly 
little fight wreck that."</P>

<P>"But at what point does all the bad 
outweigh the good?"</P>

<P>"Daria, don't worry about making what you 
perceive as
the<BR>
mistakes I've made.  You're going to make your 
own, all new<BR>
mistakes."</P>

<P>There are moments when I think 
that Mom might actually<BR>
understand.  Despite myself I felt a 
smirk slip onto myself. <BR>
"Gee, thanks for that vote of 
confidence."</P>

<P>"You know what I meant."</P>

<P>"Yeah, I'm 
living my life not yours."</P>

<P>"Exactly," Mom stood up.  "And 
Daria, just so
you know, I think<BR>
very highly of Tom.  I know that 
probably doesn't mean much to
you,<BR>
goodness knows it didn't for 
me when I was your age, but a<BR>
mother's allowed to have an opinion 
on the people her daughter's<BR>
dating."</P>

<P>"He is a good guy, 
it's just..." I paused, trying
to find the<BR>
right word.  "I'm not 
sure there's any point to it.  We're
still<BR>
in high school, who 
knows what's going to happen once we're in<BR>
college?"</P>

<P>"So 
now you can see the future?"  Mom asked, 
eyebrow
arched.</P>

<P>"Well no, "I admitted, "but the majority 
of
the possibilities out<BR>
there aren't all that good.  We've 
already broken up, several<BR>
times actually, and chances are good 
that even if we did get back<BR>
together we'd just break up again in 
a few months.  Why bother<BR>
going through the hassle more than need 
be?"</P>

<P>Mom sighed, "Daria, you can't look at it that way. 
All<BR>
relationships end someday, whether because of a breakup, 
death,<BR>
or something in between.  You can't let that stop you." 

She<BR>
paused, "You like spending time with Tom right?"</P>

<P>"I 
guess, sure," I hesitantly said.</P>

<P>"And that's what matters, 
let the future sort itself out
and live<BR>
in the now.  If the two 
of you break up again when you're both
in<BR>
college that's fine, 
but don't let the fear of a future breakup<BR>
prevent you from 
seeing someone you enjoy being with now."</P>

<P>I looked down at 
the table, "She might have a point, but
then<BR>
again that's pretty 
questionable logic," I thought to myself.
<BR>
"I'll give it some 
thought," I told Mom after a moment.</P>

<P>"I know you will," Mom 
said before bending over and
kissing my<BR>
forehead.  "And just so 
you know, whatever you decide I'll
still<BR>
love you," she paused, 
"just don't take that as permission
to run<BR>
out and get 
pregnant."</P>

<P>"Mom, don't forget who you're talking to," I 
said,
smirking.</P>

<P>"I know but still you never know, accidents 
do happen."</P>

<P>"Uh right, I'll be careful I 
promise."</P>

<P>Mom's bag started to beep, she looked down at it. 
"I
don't have<BR>
to answer that, you know."</P>

<P>"That's ok, I 
have to do my homework anyway," I stood
up and left<BR>
the kitchen 
as Mom answered her phone.  "The phone always
rings<BR>
at the most 
convenient times for her," I thought as I walked
into<BR>
my room.  I 
sat down on my bed and stared out my window, watching<BR>
the rain 
run down the glass.  "Mom presented a strong case,
but<BR>
then again 
she is a lawyer."  I sighed, "I do like Tom,
but I<BR>
really don't 
know, especially after the argument we had earlier<BR>
today."  The 
rain continued to drip down my window.  I reached<BR>
for the phone. 
"Well I've worked through every person I
can<BR>
confide in and then 
some, I guess there's only one person left
to<BR>
talk to."  I 
punched the number into the phone and listened
to it<BR>
ring on the 
other side.</P>

<P>"Hello, Sloane residence," Elsie Sloane 
said.</P>

<P>"Hi Elsie, it's, er, Daria, is, uh, Tom 
around?"</P>

<P>"Nope, sorry Daria, I haven't seen him all day.  So, 
have
you two<BR>
come to your senses and made up?"</P>

<P>"What do 
you mean?"</P>

<P>"Tom told me about the fight the two of you had 
last night.
 I<BR>
was wondering if you'd patched things 
up."</P>

<P>"Why would we?"</P>

<P>"Why wouldn't you?"  She 
countered.</P>

<P>"Because we had another fight today."</P>

<P>"Oh 
hell, you did what?"</P>

<P>"Had a fight, on my front 
lawn."</P>

<P>"Dammit, why do you two keep doing this?"</P>

<P>"I 
don't know, we just do."</P>

<P>"Well knock it off will you?  Daria 
I've never seen Tom
work at a<BR>
relationship the way he has with 
yours."</P>

<P>"Really?"</P>

<P>"Yeah, I mean, he's always come to 
me when things aren't
going<BR>
well, but that usually is it.  Jane's 
the only other person he<BR>
even tried to patch things up with, and 
even then wasn't nearly<BR>
as determined."</P>

<P>"So you're saying 
I'm an idiot for not letting 
bygones
be<BR>
bygones?"</P>

<P>"Something like that yes.  Tom's in 
love with you Daria,
though I<BR>
doubt he'll admit that right now. 
Don't screw this up."</P>

<P>"Right, of course," I sighed, "Well, 
nice talking
to you Elsie."</P>

<P>"Want me to tell Tom you 
called?"</P>

<P>I thought for a moment and realized this was a 
decision I had
to<BR>
make on my own.  "NO, that won't be 
necessary...in fact,
please<BR>
don't tell him I called.  I shouldn't 
have in the first place."</P>

<P>"Well, okay, if you 
insist."</P>

<P>"Thanks Elsie."</P>

<P>"Not a problem, what are 
little sisters for?"</P>

<P>"Annoying the piss out of their older 
siblings."</P>

<P>Elsie laughed, "There's that too."</P>

<P>"Bye 
Elsie."</P>

<P>"Bye Daria, see you 
soon?"</P>

<P>"Maybe."</P>

<P>"Give him one more chance Daria, he's 
worth it."</P>

<P>"We'll see, but don't get your hopes 
up."</P>

<P>"Ok, take care Daria."</P>

<P>"You too Elsie."  I hung 
up the phone and resumed
staring out the<BR>
window.  I had a lot to 
think about.</P>

<P>&lt;Tom&gt;</P>

<P>I parked the car in front of 
the closed gate and killed the<BR>
engine.  It was still raining 
outside and I wasn't looking<BR>
forward to going back out into 
it.</P>

<P>"Next time Mom tells you to leave an umbrella in the 
car
listen<BR>
to her," I chided myself.  "Oh what the hell, what's
a 
little<BR>
more water?"</P>

<P>I got out of the car and walked up to 
the gate.  The Wylie's
were<BR>
a bit more security conscious then my 
family - we didn't have
a<BR>
six foot high wall surrounding our 
house.  Then again, when<BR>
you're as wealthy as James Wylie it 
never hurts to be as cautious<BR>
as possible.  Plus there is the 
fact that James Wylie is a tad<BR>
eccentric, to put it mildly.  Dad 
says he's off his rocker, but<BR>
Dad also doesn't really like Mr. 
Wylie all that much either. 
He<BR>
respects the guy, "You can't 
dismiss a man who weathered
the tech<BR>
crash," Dad says.  And he's 
right, Wyl-E Co.  was one of
the only<BR>
tech stocks to actually 
stay put when the bubble burst.  The<BR>
Sloane family did not get to 
be where it is by refusing to deal<BR>
with people it doesn't like. 
I pushed the intercom and waited<BR>
for a reply, hopefully it wasn't 
too late to pay a visit to<BR>
stately Wylie Manor.</P>

<P>"Y'ello, 
who's out there?"  the jovial voice of James
Wylie<BR>
called out, 
the faintest hint of a Texas twang present.</P>

<P>"Uh, hi Mr. 
Wylie, it's Tom Sloane, I was wondering, 
is
Dave<BR>
home?"</P>

<P>"Well hi there, Tom, how the hell are 
you?"</P>

<P>"I'm doing ok Mr. Wylie."</P>

<P>"Now Tom, what have I 
told you about that Mr. Wylie business?"</P>

<P>I sighed, "Sorry, 
I'm doing ok...Jimmy."</P>

<P>"Atta boy."  For whatever reason Mr. 
Wylie took a
shine to me<BR>
when we first met.  He'd even offered me 
an internship with his<BR>
company where I'd be his personal 
assistant.  Dad was ecstatic,
I<BR>
had been less than thrilled, the 
offer was still pending.</P>

<P>"So, uh, Jimmy, about 
Dave."</P>

<P>"What about him?"</P>

<P>"Is he home?"</P>

<P>"Dave? 
Naw, he's out with that Morgendorffer girl, you
know, the<BR>
hot 
one.  Boy, I tell you, the apple didn't fall too far from<BR>
that 
tree with that one, like mother like daughter I always say."<BR>
 In 
another of life's inexplicable little oddities Mr. Wylie 
was<BR>
trying to woo Helen Morgendorffer, though if it was 
for<BR>
professional or personal gains I wasn't too sure, and 
quite<BR>
honestly I didn't really want to know.</P>

<P>"Sure enough 
Mr. Wylie, but what about the other daughter,<BR>
Daria?"  I knew he 
was talking about Quinn, and I also know
I<BR>
could admit to knowing 
that because Daria would hate to be known<BR>
as the hot one. There's 
also the fact that Daria doesn't have<BR>
much to do with Dave, and 
that she wasn't there.</P>

<P>"She's not that bad looking either, 
but a little sour...no
a lot<BR>
sour.  Sour people aren't fun to 
hang out with, you know what
I<BR>
mean?"</P>

<P>"Yes I think I do 
sir."</P>

<P>"Say Tom, last I checked it was raining outside, why 
don't
you<BR>
come on in and wait for Dave to come home?  I've got a 
couple<BR>
more candidates to show you."  Mr. Wylie maintained 
an<BR>
ever-changing list of potential spouses, most of them 
extremely<BR>
unattainable, even for a multi-billionaire like James 
Wylie. <BR>
Dave said it was his father's way of not having to 
actually move<BR>
past the death of Dave's mother.</P>

<P>"Strange 
that," I thought to myself.  "This
guy was so in love<BR>
with his 
wife that her death unhinged him to this degree.  I<BR>
wonder, if 
Daria died would I feel the same way?"  I didn't
have<BR>
an answer 
to that, but the nameless dread I felt at the thought<BR>
gave me a 
pretty good idea.</P>

<P>"Hey Tom, you still out there?" Mr. Wylie 
asked.</P>

<P>"What?  Oh, yes I am sir."</P>

<P>"Then how about 
it?"</P>

<P>Did I want to listen to some middle-aged billionaire 
wax<BR>
rhapsodic about some sweet-young thing he saw on television 
last<BR>
night?  Hell no.  "Uh, maybe some other time 
sir."</P>

<P>"All right, your loss."</P>

<P>"I'm sure, thanks for 
your time Mr. Wylie."</P>

<P>"Not a problem.  Don't be a stranger 
Tom."</P>

<P>"You bet sir."  I let go of the intercom switch 
and
walked back<BR>
to my car.  I rested against the hood and just 
stood there.  By<BR>
that poin the rain had tapered off to just a 
light mist which
was<BR>
actually sort of refreshing.  I ran a hand 
through my soaked hair<BR>
to try and straighten it out.</P>

<P>"So, 
do you wait for Dave or go do something else?"
 I asked<BR>
myself. 
I did want to talk to Dave, but waiting around for him<BR>
could get 
pretty boring pretty fast.</P>

<P>As I stood there, gripped by the 
indecision that marked the
day a<BR>
black guy walked past me.  He 
looked to be about my age and wore<BR>
his hair in short dreadlocks. 
He was wisely holding an umbrella<BR>
and wearing a raincoat.  I felt 
like I'd seen him before, but
I<BR>
couldn't quite place the face. 
When he saw me he came walking<BR>
over, a look of concern on his 
face.</P>

<P>"Hey, are you all right?"  he asked me.</P>

<P>"Yeah, 
I'm fine," I asked, trying to remember where
I knew him<BR>
from.  He 
didn't go to Fielding so if I knew him it had to be<BR>
from 
something to do with either Daria or Jane.</P>

<P>"Ok, I was just 
curious, you don't normally see people
standing<BR>
out in the rain, 
especially when they're standing in front of<BR>
their 
car."</P>

<P>I chuckled, "Yeah, I guess it does look a little 
strange."</P>

<P>"It's a good thing I'm not the cops otherwise I 
might
think<BR>
you're casing the Wylie place.  You're not 
right?"</P>

<P>I shook my head, "Nope, I just wanted to talk to 
Dave,
only he's<BR>
not in."</P>

<P>"So you're standing in the rain 
instead?  Yeah, that sounds
like<BR>
a friend of Dave, hi there, I'm 
Michael Mackenzie."  He held
out<BR>
his hand.</P>

<P>"Tom Sloane, 
pleased to meet you Michael."  I shook
the<BR>
outstretched 
hand.</P>

<P>"Call me Mack, Tom Sloane huh, I think we've met 
before,
last<BR>
summer at my girlfriend's Fourth of July 
party?"</P>

<P>Of course I remembered that party, at the time it was 
one of
the<BR>
few times Daria allowed me to be seen with her in 
public.  "Oh,<BR>
right, of course.  How are you Mack?"</P>

<P>Mack 
shrugged, "I'm doing well enough.  I can't wait 
to
graduate,<BR>
obviously.  I think the better question would be how 
are you<BR>
doing?"</P>

<P>I could tell this wasn't just a polite 
inquiry,  "I'm
fine, why<BR>
do you ask?"</P>

<P>"Well for starters 
Jodie and I talked to Daria today."</P>

<P>"Crap," I thought, "I 
know that Daria doesn't
gab about her life<BR>
with just anyone, she 
really must think highly of these two."
 I<BR>
cleared my throat, 
"Yeah, well, these things happen."</P>

<P>Mack nodded, "Yeah that's 
true, too bad though, Daria's
a pretty<BR>
cool person, a little 
strange, but a cool person."</P>

<P>"That she is, I agreed.  "So, 
what brings you out
here?"  I<BR>
asked, trying to change the 
topic.</P>

<P>"Oh Jodie, my girlfriend, lives in the neighborhood. 

I'm just<BR>
walking on home."</P>

<P>"On a rainy 
night?"</P>

<P>"Back where I grew up it wasn't really safe to walk 
the
streets<BR>
at night, so I still consider it a 
novelty."</P>

<P>"Where are you from initially?"  I never really 
spent
much time<BR>
outside of Lawndale.  Sure, I've been to all the 
hotspots, New<BR>
York, London, Los Angeles, even Tokyo, but I'd 
never really lived<BR>
there.  Small town life was the only way of 
life I knew, and to<BR>
meet someone with a different outlook was 
fascinating.</P>

<P>"Baltimore originally, but we moved here years 
ago so
I don't<BR>
remember it too well."</P>

<P>"I've been to 
Baltimore, it seemed like a nice enough
city,<BR>
though I guess I 
only saw the goodparts."</P>

<P>Mack nodded, "Yeah probably, when 
you get right down to
it every<BR>
town has a seamy 
side."</P>

<P>"Every town except our beloved Lawndale," I 
said
sarcastically.</P>

<P>Mack chuckled, "Yeah, right I forgot 
about that."
 We lapsed into<BR>
a moderately uncomfortable silence. 
"So, what's it like?"
 Mack<BR>
asked finally.</P>

<P>"What's what 
like?"</P>

<P>"Having more money than you know what to do 
with?"</P>

<P>I smiled, "I'll let you know when I have that 
much."</P>

<P>Mack frowned, "But I thought you were incredibly 
rich."</P>

<P>"Correction, my family is rich."</P>

<P>"What's the 
difference?"</P>

<P>"I don't have access to the loot.  All my money 
is tied
up in<BR>
trust funds that I get contingent on my graduating 
college.  All<BR>
I get until then is a small portion of the 
interest."  I
left out<BR>
that the "small portion" was probably as 
much as his
family made<BR>
in a year.</P>

<P>"Bummer I guess, but 
still what's it like to know you're
set for<BR>
life.  I mean if you 
wanted to you'd never have to work a day
in<BR>
your life."</P>

<P>I 
smiled a little as I felt the old Sloane indoctrination kick<BR>
in. 
"Fortunes aren't made by sitting on piles of money.
 It took<BR>
a 
lot of hard work to get the Sloane family where it is today,<BR>
and 
it will take just as much work to keep it there.  All the<BR>
great 
families and empires were destroyed by one thing,<BR>
complacency. 
If you ever get complacent you lose, and the<BR>
Sloanes aren't 
losers.  So you see keeping a fortune is just as<BR>
much work as 
earning one."</P>

<P>"Wow, sorry I asked."</P>

<P>"It's ok, my 
dad's been drilling that into me ever since
I was in<BR>
preschool so 
by now it's one of those automatic things.  Don't<BR>
worry about 
it."</P>

<P>"Uh, ok."</P>

<P>"But to answer your question, no I 
don't feel much different
than<BR>
anyone else I suppose.  There are 
probably more lawyers and<BR>
accountants around, but that's about 
it.  Having lots of<BR>
money doesn't protect you from having a bad 
day, or any of life's<BR>
little issues.  And a lot of times it 
hinders you when you're<BR>
dealing with the big things like..." I 
stopped, then<BR>
started"...love..." my voice trailed off.  I 
hadn't
intended to<BR>
go there, but it just 
happened.</P>

<P>"Yeah," Mack said, "I suppose that's 
true."</P>

<P>"Hey Mack, you've gone out with your girlfriend for 
a
long time,<BR>
right?"</P>

<P>Mack nodded, "For about as long as 
we've lived in Lawndale<BR>
actually."</P>

<P>"Wow, how have you 
done it?"</P>

<P>Mack shrugged, "I don't know, we just 
have."</P>

<P>"Come on, you must have some idea."</P>

<P>"Looking 
for some advice with Daria huh?"</P>

<P>"Well kind of," I 
admitted.</P>

<P>"I don't know how much use to you anything I might 
say
will be. <BR>
Jodie is like the anti-Daria after 
all."</P>

<P>"But you've been successful at a long-term 
relationship,
which is<BR>
more than I can say for 
myself."</P>

<P>Mack looked thoughtful for a moment, "Jodie and I, 
well
I<BR>
obviously can't say our relationship is perfect, but we 
always<BR>
get back together."</P>

<P>"But why?"  I 
insisted.</P>

<P>"Because I can't imagine life any other way.  We 
support
each<BR>
other, I'm always there to listen to her bitch about 
her parents,<BR>
she's always there to listen to me complain about 
school."</P>

<P>"So it's for mutual support?" I asked, mentally 
ticking
that off<BR>
a list in my head.  Daria and I certainly did 
act as sounding<BR>
boards for each other.</P>

<P>"There is that, 
but that's just one part of the whole
package. <BR>
Jodie's smart, 
funny, beautiful, everything I'm looking for, and<BR>
to find that 
package in a sister?  Why do I need anything else?"
<BR>
He paused, 
"But all that's secondary, the real reason is
because<BR>
I love her 
and she feels the same way.  What other reason do 
you<BR>
need?"</P>

<P>My eyebrows raised involuntarily, "None I 
guess."</P>

<P>Mack must have seen the incredulity on my face, 
"What,
you're<BR>
surprised I'd say I love jodie?"</P>

<P>"Well a 
little yeah."</P>

<P>"Jodie helped me througha rough patch in my 
life.  Because
of<BR>
that we'll always share a bond.  right now 
that's love, later
on<BR>
who knows exactly, but in some way shape or 
form I'll always love<BR>
her."  Mack paused, "That does seem sort of 
heavy for
someone my<BR>
age to say doesn't it?"</P>

<P>"Not if 
you're several years younger, and a girl."</P>

<P>Mack chuckled, 
"You really need to get back together with
Daria."</P>

<P>"And why's 
that?"</P>

<P>"Because the two of you are too damn similar, that's 
why.
 What<BR>
was the reason she gave for breaking up with you 
anyway?"</P>

<P>"She said our relationship was starting to mirror 
her
parents."</P>

<P>"Ouch, that is pretty harsh."</P>

<P>"Yeah 
tell me about it.  Have any words of wisdom?"</P>

<P>"Not really, 
well maybe you could try to do something
parents<BR>
wouldn't do, you 
know to prove that the two of you are different<BR>
from her 
folks."</P>

<P>"That's a good idea, I have no idea how to pull it 
off,
but it's<BR>
a good idea."</P>

<P>Mack laughed, "I've always 
found that groveling is highly<BR>
effective."</P>

<P>"Yeah, 
groveling," I said, distracted by the plan
beginning to<BR>
form in 
my head, "Thanks for the tip."</P>

<P>"Hey, no problem, just trying 
to help a brother out,"
he looked<BR>
me over, "So to speak.  Good 
luck with that thing man."</P>

<P>"Thanks."  As I watched Mack walk 
down the street
I reflected on<BR>
how much I wished he went to 
Fielding.  It's not like he'd have<BR>
any problem getting in, he 
plays football and he's a minority.
<BR>
"It would have been nice to 
have had a sympathetic ear while
I<BR>
went through that place."  I 
sighed, "Of course it's
a moot point<BR>
now since it's almost over, 
but still I wish I'd gotten to know<BR>
that guy a little better, he 
seems pretty cool."  While I
stood<BR>
there, contemplating lost 
opportunities a Volkswagen Beetle<BR>
pulled up in front of the gate. 
The driver killed the engine
and<BR>
stepped out of the 
car.</P>

<P>"I was wondering when you'd show your face," Dave
Wylie 
said to<BR>
me.</P>

<P>"I come seeking insight, oh wise guru," I 
said mockingly.
<BR>
"Besides I could say the same about you.  What 
were you and
Quinn<BR>
doing anyway?"</P>

<P>"Studying," Dave 
answered in a tone that said his
answer was<BR>
final.</P>

<P>"Ok, 
well, I'm sure you know why I'm here."</P>

<P>"You're in need of 
some guidance in regards to you and
Daria's<BR>
relationship, and for 
some reason you think I'll have good<BR>
advice."</P>

<P>"That's 
about it, yeah," I replied bashfully.</P>

<P>Dave sighed, "All 
right, come on in."  He punched
a code into the<BR>
intercom box and 
the gate swung open.  I got into my car and<BR>
followed the Beetle 
through the gate.  We parked beside the house<BR>
and Dave let us in 
through a side door.  "You probably don't
want<BR>
to talk to my dad 
right?" he asked, I nodded in reply.  "Ok
we<BR>
can go straight to 
my room."  Dave lead me up a small staircase<BR>
and into his room. 
He took a towel out of his closet and tossed<BR>
it at me.  "Here, 
you look like you could use this.  Don't
worry, <BR>
it's 
clean."</P>

<P>"Thanks," I started to towel my head dry.</P>

<P>"So 
you're in need of guidance?"</P>

<P>I nodded, "Yeah."</P>

<P>"What 
in particular are you in need of guidance about?"</P>

<P>"You mean 
beyond Daria?"</P>

<P>"Yeah." "Well should I try to get back 
together
with her?"  I<BR>
settled into an easy chair.</P>

<P>Dave 
shrugged, "I don't know, do you think she wants 
you
back?"</P>

<P>"She says no, but I'm not sure if I can let it go 
at just
that."</P>

<P>Dave turned on his stereo before flopping down 
on his bed.
 The<BR>
strains of some concert started to float through 
the room.  "It's<BR>
Bela Fleck and the Flecktones," he said, 
answering my unspoken<BR>
question, "October Twenty-eighth, 
Ninety-nine, the second
set<BR>
will blow your mind.  It doesn't get 
much better than a FOB<BR>
Schoeps source."</P>

<P>"Uh sure thing," 
I had no clue what he was talking
about, and <BR>
my mom always told 
me when in doubt agree.</P>

<P>"But as much as I want it to a 
Flecktones show doesn't
solve your<BR>
problem does it?  Okay, so why 
can't you let sleeping dogs lie?"</P>

<P>I took a deep breath, I 
knew what I had to say, but I didn't
know<BR>
how to say it.  "It's 
like this, you've heard the story about<BR>
Daria, Jane and myself, 
right?"  Dave nodded, "Well
it all goes<BR>
back to that.  See, Daria 
thinks our first kiss was a rash<BR>
impluse, and I'm not going to 
dissuade her from that opinion,
but<BR>
the truth of the matter is 
that I wanted to be there with her.
 I<BR>
knew it was a bad idea, 
that Jane and I should at least break
up<BR>
first, but I couldn't 
help myself.  From the very beginning, when<BR>
she hated my guts, 
there was something about her that intrigued<BR>
me.  Then I got to 
spend more time with her and she turned out
to<BR>
be smart, funny, 
and at the time she didn't seem to care that
my<BR>
family was one of 
the richest in Lawndale.  How could I resist?
<BR>
Sure, that makes 
me an ass, but I'm just one of a long line of<BR>
assholes who do 
dumb things in the name of love."  I 
paused
for<BR>
breath.</P>

<P>"There's the nut," Dave 
said.</P>

<P>"What?"</P>

<P>"You love her, don't 
you."</P>

<P>"I...don't know.  I mean I like her a whole 
lot..."</P>

<P>"Dude you just said it.  Don't backpedal, it's 
unbecoming."</P>

<P>"Ok, so I love her, big deal."</P>

<P>"Why 
don't you just tell her want you just told me?"</P>

<P>"Because 
she'd freak out, think about it, you know Daria."</P>

<P>Dave 
scratched his chin, "Yeah, you're probably right.
 Nice<BR>
little 
conundrum you're in." "I think I might have an
out, but<BR>
I'm not 
sure if I should try it."</P>

<P>"Dude, do you love 
her?"</P>

<P>"Yeah, I suppose I do."</P>

<P>"Do you want to get 
back together?"</P>

<P>"Definitely."</P>

<P>"Well then, lay this 
plan on me."  So I did.  "Damn
dude, 
that's<BR>
clever."</P>

<P>"It's really Mack Mackenzie's idea, he 
told me to do something
to<BR>
prove that we weren't like her 
parents."</P>

<P>"I don't think this is quite what he had in 
mind,"
Dave said,<BR>
chuckling.</P>

<P>"No but it certainly does 
fit the criteria."</P>

<P>"That it does.  You're taking an awfully 
big risk here
Sloane."</P>

<P>"I suppose I am, but if it works I'm 
golden.  If it doesn't
I<BR>
haven't really lost 
anything."</P>

<P>"Except Daria," Dave pointed out.</P>

<P>"Well 
yeah, but she's pretty much lost to me right now,
so 
nothing<BR>
ventured, nothing gained."</P>

<P>"Too true, so when are 
you going to lay your Jedi kung-fu
on<BR>
her?"</P>

<P>"Tomorrow, 
I'll stop by her house around 
noon."</P>

<P>"Suggestion."</P>

<P>"Yeah?"</P>

<P>"A neutral site 
might be better, like the park or somehting."</P>

<P>"I suppose so, 
but how do I get her there?"</P>

<P>"Good question, she probably 
won't go if you just ask
her right?"</P>

<P>"Yeah," I agreed. 
"Which leaves subterfuge,
but then she'll be<BR>
pissed at me for 
lying to her."</P>

<P>"What if you're not the person who does the 
lying?"</P>

<P>"Get a patsy?  That might work, but 
who?"</P>

<P>"It's got to be someone Daria trusts an opinion she 
values."</P>

<P>"Forget it, there's no way Jane would assist, 
there's
too much<BR>
bad blood between us."</P>

<P>"I'm not talking 
about Jane!"  Dave snapped, "I'm
talking 
about<BR>
Quinn."</P>

<P>"Our of all the names I least expected to 
hear...Quinn
was pretty<BR>
much up there.  "Quinn?  Are you high? 
Why on earth would
I ask<BR>
her? "</P>

<P>"Because outside of you 
she's the only person I know who
wants to<BR>
get you and Daria back 
together."</P>

<P>"Seriously?  Why?"</P>

<P>"She says she can 
relate to Daria better when she's going
out<BR>
with 
you."</P>

<P>"And you know this because?"</P>

<P>"It's all she 
could talk about when we were at the 
library<BR>
tonight."</P>

<P>"Oh, so Quinn wants me and Daria to 
back together because
it<BR>
makes her feel better?"</P>

<P>Dave 
shrugged, "Hey, this is Quinn we're talking about.
 You take<BR>
what 
you can get."</P>

<P>"Whatever, ok, so we get Quinn to trick Daria 
into going
to the<BR>
park where she'll meet me..." I paused, "It's 
still
too obvious. <BR>
Let's add another level to the 
subterfuge."</P>

<P>"Ok, how?"</P>

<P>"Simple, we make it look like 
Elsie tricked me into going
as<BR>
well."</P>

<P>"Fake a younger 
sibling conspiracy?  You magnificent bastard,<BR>
that's 
brilliant!"</P>

<P>"We all know little sibs like to interfere with 
our lives,
Daria<BR>
will never suspect a thing."</P>

<P>"Will Elsie 
play ball?"</P>

<P>"Sure, I don't see why not."</P>

<P>"Ok, I'll 
call Quinn and let her know."</P>

<P>"Have her call Elsie," I 
said.</P>

<P>"Why?"</P>

<P>"We're faking a conspiracy right?  Well, 
we need a paper
trail."</P>

<P>"You can't be serious, there's no way 
Daria could check
the phone<BR>
records.  Dude, you're being 
paranoid."</P>

<P>"I'm just covering all the bases.  You need wheels 
within
wheels<BR>
to outwit Daria."</P>

<P>"then you've got a 
problem, because this whole thing starts
with<BR>
me calling Quinn 
and filling her in on the mission."</P>

<P>"I know, that's been 
bothering me..."  I thought
for a moment,<BR>
"I've got it.  Call 
Quinn, tell her you've got a solution
to some<BR>
problem she's been 
having and that you have to tell it to her
in<BR>
person.  Meet 
somewhere, a pizza place or something, that's nice<BR>
and public, 
but easy to hide in."  I stood up and grabbed
a pen<BR>
and pad of 
paper from Dave's desk.  "Giver her this,"
I jotted a<BR>
quick note 
down on the paper and handed it to Dave.</P>

<P>"Let me guess, she's 
supposed to destroy it after she
reads 
it?"</P>

<P>"Exactly."</P>

<P>"And if we're captured will the 
Agency disavow all knowledge
of<BR>
us?"  Dave asked, smirking at his 
joke.</P>

<P>"Hey, knock it off, this is serious."</P>

<P>"Uh-huh, 
what if Quinn can't get Elsie to play ball?"</P>

<P>"Have Quinn call 
you, then you call me.  I'll take care
of Elsie,<BR>
though I'd 
rather not.  It'll be better if Elsie thinks it's<BR>
Quinn's 
idea."</P>

<P>"You are Machiavelli reborn, did you know 
that?"</P>

<P>"How so?"</P>

<P>"You're separating yourself from the 
execution of this
little<BR>
plan of yours.  Elsie'll think it's 
Quinn's idea, Quinn'll think<BR>
it was my idea."</P>

<P>"And what 
about you?"</P>

<P>"Oh I know the truth, but I won't say anything. 
Rich-boy
Omerta<BR>
and all that."</P>

<P>"Gee 
thanks."</P>

<P>"Would you like me to place the call now, or after 
you've
left?"</P>

<P>"Does it matter?"</P>

<P>"If you're not around 
you've got plausible deniability;
if you<BR>
want to take this trip 
to it's extreme."</P>

<P>"Good point, make the call when I'm 
gone."</P>

<P>Dave nodded, "All right, need anything 
else?"</P>

<P>I shook my head, "Nope, thanks for the help 
Dave."</P>

<P>"Don't mention it, just be sure to buy plenty of 
Wylie
stock when<BR>
you're in charge of the family 
business."</P>

<P>I chuckled, "I'll see what I can do.  Bye 
Dave."</P>

<P>"Take it easy, and get some rest, Operation Niccolo 
goes
into<BR>
effect tomorrow."</P>

<P>I felt my eyebrows reach for 
my forehead.  "Operation
Niccolo?"</P>

<P>"Best I could think up on 
the fly, do you have a better
name?"</P>

<P>"Well, 
no."</P>

<P>"That's what I thought, now get out of 
here."</P>

<P>"Right, I'll let myself out."  I walked out of 
Dave's
room as he<BR>
was reaching for his phone to start the wheels 
moving.</P>

<P>"I wonder if this cockeyed scheme will actually 
work?"
 I asked<BR>
myself as I stepped outside and walked towards my 
car.  I<BR>
shrugged, "Oh well, I'll find out tomorrow."  I got
into 
the car<BR>
and drove home.</P>

<P>&lt;Daria&gt;</P>

<P>I woke up 
with the usual slowness that Saturday allows for,
or at<BR>
least 
partially.  I groggily opened my eyes to check the clo9ck<BR>
and saw 
Quinn standing over me.</P>

<P>"Oh good, you're awake, come on 
there's a lot to do today."</P>

<P>"Gah!  Quinn, what the hell are 
you doing?"  I shouted
as I<BR>
reached for my glasses.</P>

<P>"I'm 
waiting for you to wake up.  Now come on, get out
of bed." <BR>
She 
reached for my arm to pull me up.</P>

<P>"Oh no," I said, snatching 
my arm out of her grasp.
 "Not until<BR>
you tell me 
why."</P>

<P>Quinn sighed, "Because we have to go to the park."</P>

<P>I winced, Quinn wasn't going to make this easy.  "And
wh 
y should<BR>
I go to the park with you?  You know I have other plans 
for<BR>
today."</P>

<P>"Let me guess, you're going to spend the day 
in bed."</P>

<P>"It's a plan, not a very active plan, but a plan 
nevertheless.
<BR>
Now excuse me while I put my plan into action."  I 
rolled
over on<BR>
my bed so I was facing away from 
Quinn.</P>

<P>"Daria!"  Quinn whined, "Stop being so 
obstreperous."</P>

<P>Ok, I admit, Quinn using a word like 
obstreperous piqued my<BR>
curiosity, I rolled back over.  "What did 
you say?"</P>

<P>"I said stop being so obstreperous.  Is you hearing 
going
now<BR>
along with your eyesight?"</P>

<P>"That's what I 
thought you said.  Where'd you learn a
word 
like<BR>
obstreperous?"</P>

<P>"I've bee reading the dictionary," 
Quinn said waving
a hand,<BR>
dismissing any further inquiry into the 
subject.  "Now are
you<BR>
getting up or not?"</P>

<P>"Not," I said 
with as much force as I could.</P>

<P>"I brought the latest issue of 
'Waif' with me, and you
know how I<BR>
have to read aloud to get any 
comprehension," she added,
the faux<BR>
innocence dripping from her 
voice.</P>

<P>"You wouldn't."</P>

<P>"Are you getting up or 
not?"</P>

<P>"Why should I?"</P>

<P>"Because there's this thing in 
the park and Mom won't
let me go<BR>
by myself, and Dad doesn't count 
as not being by myself."</P>

<P>"Fifty."</P>

<P>"Ten," she 
countered.</P>

<P>"Forty."</P>

<P>"Thirty," Quinn offered, cutting 
the haggling short.</P>

<P>"Okay, just let me get cleaned up."  I 
got out of
bed and walked<BR>
to the bathroom to try and drive away 
the last few remaining<BR>
cobwebs in my head.</P>

<P>When I got out 
of the bathroom after taking my shower I found<BR>
Quinn standing in 
front of my room.  "Be sure to wear something<BR>
cute, you're going 
to be seen in public with me after all."
 I<BR>
shot Quinn a dirty 
look and entered my room to get dressed.</P>

<P>A short while alter 
Quinn was hustling me through the park.
 "I<BR>
don't know what took 
you so long, it's not like you're wearing<BR>
anything 
new."</P>

<P>I smirked, dragging my feet had proven to be a good way 
to
nettle<BR>
Quinn.  "Where exactly are we going anyway?"  I 
asked.</P>

<P>"Not too far...oh look, there's Stacy, stay right 
here,
I have to<BR>
go talk to her,"  Quinn darted off before I could 
protest.</P>

<P>"Great, I let myself get conned into going to the 
park
with<BR>
Quinn, and then she ditches me, how typical."  I went 
to
sit down<BR>
on a nearby park bench, but stopped when I saw it was 
still wet<BR>
from yesterday's rain.  "There's just one thing left 
that
would<BR>
make this perfect," I muttered to myself.  Predictably 
Tom
and<BR>
Elsie came walking down the path.  "That was far too 
pat,"
I<BR>
thought, "Something must be up."</P>

<P>"Hi Daria," 
Elsie said brightly, "Funny seeing
you here."</P>

<P>"Yeah, funny 
that," I glared at Tom as I tried to
figure out if<BR>
this was his 
doing.</P>

<P>"I, er, saw my friend Becky over there, I think I'll 
go
say hi to<BR>
her."</P>

<P>"Elsie, wait a second..." Tom started 
to say, but
by that time<BR>
Elsie had run off.  "Damnit, I knew 
something was up when
she<BR>
asked if I wanted to go to the 
park."</P>

<P>About then the pieces of the puzzle started to fall 
into place,<BR>
"So Elsie tricked you into coming 
here?"</P>

<P>"Yeah, why?"</P>

<P>"Because Quinn did the same with 
me.  It looks like our
siblings<BR>
have conspired against us in some 
vain hope that will get back<BR>
together."</P>

<P>I frowned, "I 
didn't think they knew each other well enough
to<BR>
pull off a stunt 
like this."</P>

<P>"I don't know about Quinn, but Elsie's been 
telling me
that I'd<BR>
be an idiot if I did let you go."</P>

<P>I 
nodded, "Quinn's said something similar.  Still it doesn't<BR>
really 
seem to be Quinn's thing."  Something didn't sit quite<BR>
right; 
there had to be another person involved. I shrugged, "I'll<BR>
sweat 
it out of Quinn tonight."</P>

<P>"Glad I'm not Quinn," Tom said, 
chuckling.</P>

<P>I frowned, "You've got your own ass kicking coming 
if
you don't<BR>
leave soon."</P>

<P>"Whoa, hold up before you kick 
my teeth in can I say something?"</P>

<P>"Ok, but please don't make 
it some weepy sentimental bid
for my<BR>
affections."</P>

<P>"Don't 
worry, I know better than that.  No, I just wanted
to say<BR>
this. 
Daria, I do care about you, a lot.  But you say our<BR>
relationship 
is doomed because we're acting like your parents.
<BR>
Ok, I can 
accept that, sort of.  However, I don't agree, so I
was<BR>
thinking, 
how do I prove that to you?  The answer was simple<BR>
enough, we 
stay broken up."</P>

<P>"Run that by me again?"  I asked not quite 
following
what Tom was<BR>
saying.</P>

<P>"You say that your parents 
are locked in a self-destructive
cycle<BR>
of fighting and 
reconciliation, and that we do the same.  So to<BR>
prove to you that 
we're not like your parents I'm not going to<BR>
try and convince you 
to do anything."</P>

<P>"But isn't this just a ploy to get me back?" 
I asked,
not<BR>
falling for the smooth line.</P>

<P>Tom sighed, 
"Daria, I'm pretty sure..." he stopped,
as if unsure<BR>
what to say 
next.  "I'd really love it if you changed your
mind,<BR>
but I'm not 
going to try and talk you into anything.  This is<BR>
your 
decision...but having said that, don't let your parents rule<BR>
your 
life.  You should be making the decision, not them.:"</P>

<P>"And 
you assume that I'll choose you if I'm free of 
any
outside<BR>
influence?"  I asked, a tinge of anger started to 
creep into
my<BR>
voice.</P>

<P>"You're free to choose whatever you 
want.  I know the
choice that<BR>
I'm in support of, but if it's not 
your choice, I can live with<BR>
that."</P>

<P>This was Tom as his 
best, and worst.  He was being so<BR>
understanding and sympathetic 
that my ingrained cynicism<BR>
suspected something was amiss.  "Why 
are you pushing this
so<BR>
hard?"  I asked him.</P>

<P>"Because I 
like spending time with you.  You're a special
person<BR>
Daria, I 
don't want to lose you."</P>

<P>"We could just be friends," I 
offered.</P>

<P>"Now that wouldn't be incredibly awkward wouldn't 
it?"</P>

<P>"I guess you're right about that...but still, I 
don't
like the<BR>
choices you're presenting me, be your girlfriend 
or have nothing<BR>
to do with you."</P>

<P>"So you're saying you 
don't really want to get back together
with<BR>
me?"</P>

<P>"I'm 
saying I don't like my choices here, there's no middle<BR>
ground. 
Are you saying you can't be friends with me?"</P>

<P>Tom paused for 
a long moment, "I guess that is pretty
harsh 
isn't<BR>
it?"</P>

<P>"So where does that leave us?"  I 
asked.</P>

<P>Tom shrugged, "I don't know."  We stood there, 
looking
at each<BR>
other.  I got the feeling that we were standing 
in front of two<BR>
doors, and that once I chose a door there would 
be no going back.<BR>
 It was a decision I didn't want to make. 
"Daria, I've got
a<BR>
question for 
you."</P>

<P>"Yeah?"</P>

<P>"When we were going out, did you have a 
good time, the
fights<BR>
excluded?"</P>

<P>I didn't have to think 
for very long to arrive at an answer.
<BR>
"Yes, the fights excluded 
I did."</P>

<P>Tom stood there, as if expecting me to say something 
else.
 When<BR>
I didn't he sighed,  "Ok, take it easy Daria, I'll 
see you<BR>
around."  Tom turned to walk away.</P>

<P>That was when 
it hit me, it wasn't about the fights.  It was<BR>
about the space 
between the arguments that made it worthwhile.
<BR>
The thing that 
was screwed up about my parents wasn't the cycle<BR>
of fights and 
reconciling, it was the severity with which they<BR>
did it.  Plus 
there was Tom, yes it was trite and cliched, but
he<BR>
had been 
willing to let us stay apart because I couldn't handle<BR>
the 
relation-date-ship thing.  It must have been hard for 
him
to<BR>
decide to do that, and then follow through like he was. 
One of<BR>
those doors was closing, but it felt like there was still 
time
to<BR>
make sure the right door close.</P>

<P>"Hey Tom, wait 
up."</P>

<P>---xxx---xxx---</P>

<P>Two teens, a boy wearing a gray 
sweater and khaki cargo pants
and<BR>
a girl wearing a lightweight 
green jacket and black skirt stood<BR>
on a path in a 
park.</P>

<P>"Look, I'm sorry..." the girl started to 
say.</P>

<P>"So am I," the boy said, interrupting the 
girl.</P>

<P>"No you were right, we aren't my parents and I 
shouldn't
let my<BR>
fears about their relationship affect 
ours."</P>

<P>"So we have a relationship again?"  the boy 
asked
hopefully.</P>

<P>The girl smiled, ever so slightly, "Yeah, I 
guess we do."</P>

<P>The boy closed the distance between them.  "You 
know there
will<BR>
be arguments ahead."</P>

<P>The girl shrugged, 
"We'll just work them out as they come
along,<BR>
isn't that what 
mature people do?"</P>

<P>The boy smiled, "Yeah, that or we'll just 
beat the crap
out of<BR>
each other."</P>

<P>"Hmm, tempting," the 
girl said before kissing the
boy on the<BR>
cheek.  "But no.  I am 
interested in getting a slice or two<BR>
though."</P>

<P>"Isn't it a 
little early for pizza?"</P>

<P>"I can think of more than a few ways 
to kill some time,
can't<BR>
you?"</P>

<P>"Very true, lead on 
MacDuff."</P>

<P>The two teens started to walk out of the clearing. 
As they<BR>
neared the edge the girl turned around.  "Quinn?" 
she
called<BR>
out, "You're still dead meat."  She and the boy 
then
linked arms<BR>
and walked away.</P>

<P>After the couple was 
safely out of sight another pair of teens<BR>
emerged from the brush 
surrounding the clearing.  Two girls, one<BR>
with long red hair, the 
other a brunette whose hair came down
to<BR>
her 
shoulders.</P>

<P>"Well," the redhead said, "that went better
than I 
expected."</P>

<P>"Uh, aren't you afraid?"</P>

<P>"Why should I 
be?"</P>

<P>"Your sister just said you were dead meat."</P>

<P>"Oh 
she says that all the time, by the time she gets home
she'll<BR>
have 
forgotten all about it."</P>

<P>"Are you sure about 
that?"</P>

<P>"Oh yeah, she's always in a good mood after spending 
time
with<BR>
Tom."</P>

<P>"Always?"  the brunette asked, arching an 
eyebrow.</P>

<P>"Well most of the time anyway, tonight for 
sure."</P>

<P>"Ok, it's your life," the brunette paused.  "Uh,
now 
what do we<BR>
do?"</P>

<P>The redhead shrugged, "There's a sale at 
Cashman's."</P>

<P>"You know, I've never been to a sale in my 
life."</P>

<P>"Never?"  the redhead asked in 
disbelief.</P>

<P>"Think about who you're talking to."</P>

<P>"Oh 
yeah, want to come along?  We could work on your 
clothes."</P>

<P>"What's wrong with my clothes?"</P>

<P>"They're 
so...preppy."</P>

<P>"If I let you pick out a new wardrobe, will I 
be the envy
of all<BR>
the girls at the country club?"</P>

<P>"Oh 
definitely, I have the best fashion sense."</P>

<P>"Great...wait a 
second, how are we going to get there?
 Our rides<BR>
just off to 
make out."</P>

<P>The redhead help up a key ring, "I've got my 
learner's
permit,<BR>
and I know for a fact they took Tom's car. 
Let's roll."</P>

<P>As they walked out of the clearing the brunette 
draped an arm<BR>
over the redhead's shoulder, "You know Quinn, this 
could
be the<BR>
start of a beautiful 
friendship."</P>

<P>&lt;Fin&gt;</P>

<P><B>The Space 
Between<BR>
</B>You cannot quit me so quickly<BR>
There's no hope in 
you for me<BR>
No corner you could squeeze me<BR>
But I got all the 
time for you, love<BR>
The Space Between<BR>
The tears we cry<BR>
Is 
the laughter keeps us coming back for more<BR>
The Space 
Between<BR>
The wicked lies we tell<BR>
And hope to keep safe from 
the pain<BR>
But will I hold you again?<BR>
These fickle, fuddled 
words confuse me<BR>
Like 'Will it rain today?'<BR>
Waste the hours 
with talking, talking<BR>
These twisted games we're playing<BR>
We're 
strange allies<BR>
With warring hearts<BR>
What wild-eyed beast you 
be<BR>
The Space Between<BR>
The wicked lies we tell<BR>
And hope to 
keep safe from the pain<BR>
Will I hold you again?<BR>
Will I 
hold...<BR>
Look at us spinning out in<BR>
The madness of a roller 
coaster<BR>
You know you went off like a devil<BR>
In a church in the 
middle of a crowded room<BR>
All we can do, my love<BR>
Is hope we 
don't take this ship down<BR>
The Space Between<BR>
Where you're 
smiling high<BR>
Is where you'll find me if I get to go<BR>
The Space 
Between<BR>
The bullets in our firefight<BR>
Is where I'll be hiding, 
waiting for you<BR>
The rain that falls<BR>
Splash in your 
heart<BR>
Ran like sadness down the window into...<BR>
The Space 
Between<BR>
Our wicked lies<BR>
Is where we hope to keep safe from 
pain<BR>
Take my hand<BR>
'Cause we're walking out of here<BR>
Oh, 
right out of here<BR>
Love is all we need here<BR>
The Space 
Between<BR>
What's wrong and right<BR>
Is where you'll find me 
hiding, waiting for you<BR>
The Space Between<BR>
Your heart and 
mine<BR>
Is the space we'll fill with time<BR>
The Space 
Between...</P>

<P>&lt;Author's comments&gt;</P>

<P>I find I don't 
have too much to say here.  I absolutely love
the whole lyric concept 
of The Space Between and I thought it
would make a killer framework 
to wrap a Daria and Tom story around.
 The whole first person POV 
came about in an attempt to be "artistic."
 And considering the hell 
I went through on my last 1st person
story you'd think I would've 
learned my lesson. The story's been
sitting in "Development hell" for 
about a month or two
as I wrangled out the edits and revisions. 
Kudos to the folks
who took the time to read it and give me input, 
you folks know
who you are and thanks.  I hope this little bit of 
fluff entertained,
and keep your eyes peeled for my next offering, 
the long awaited
Mack-centric fic.</P>
