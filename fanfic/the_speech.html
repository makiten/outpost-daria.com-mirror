<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Introduction:
When C.S. Lewis opened the Screwtape letters, he warned that the devils do
exist and take equal pleasure in two attitudes. The first is denial of their
existence. The second is an unnatural fascination with them. Before reading
please keep a few things in mind. First of all God is far more powerful and
clever than Satan. Secondly it’s wise to know what deceptions the devils may try
but generally it’s not a good idea to dwell on them too much. Third of all this
work is being written from a Catholic point of view and is, of course, almost
complete fiction and/or speculation. However I am hoping that people of all
faiths may take something away from it. The setting is hell. A group of devils
in training that have been assigned to tempt to graduating class of Lawndale
(2002) is having a graduation of their own. They guest speaker is none other
than Lewis’s Screwtape. The next voice you hear will be his.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>My
fellow colleagues, for that is what we must now call you, the life you are
entering is one of the utmost importance. It is the only way of life we
practitioners of temptation have. A human soul is worth more than all the
riches of the earth. It is all we can do against the Enemy in our banishment.
The day will come when life on earth will end and we will be put completely out
of mind. The souls here, though roasting alive in the dark flames of our realm,
will feel a coldness like they have never felt before when the distance between
our realm and His becomes infinitely greater on that day. We must act while we
can. You are the future for our brotherhood and as such I wish to give some
parting words of wisdom to certain members of the graduating class on how to
handle their patients. The rest of you pay heed as the advice I give them may
aid you in your practice someday.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Now for those of you who are sci-fi fans (I know some of you are out there,
don’t deny it, I’m quite certain I heard fluent Klingon being spoken in the
dorms) you will remember Yoda’s speech about fear. If I recall correctly fear
leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering. What our dear
little green friend neglected to mention was these things have a delightful
tendency towards damnation. Thus is the case with this patient. Once again two
of our favorite tools are at work, fear and the sins of the parent. The patient
has grown up in an affluent suburb, which is mostly white. Her mother suffered
terrible racism during her younger years and even had one run in with our loyal
servants in the Klan. Since then she has been hostile towards white people and
treats them with great suspicion. Though she has not exactly convinced her
daughter that every white family keeps even whiter sheets in their closets, the
seeds are sewn. At school the patient saw a lack of multiculturalism and was
horrified. Truth be, told it was mainly coincidence but she became resentful
and frightened. Her level of stress around her mostly white classmates
skyrocketed as she became increasingly convinced that all eyes were on her,
just waiting for her to fail. She was convinced that she had to be… what was it
she said… oh yes, queen of the Negroes. Yet it cannot be said truthfully that
she faced any real racism. The most delicious irony of all was that she felt
stressed at school around people who truly liked her and cared about her
regardless but relaxed at home around her parents with a racist mother and a
father that pushed her too hard. I daresay her practitioner has done a
remarkable job. Now she’s off to an all black school that has it’s advantages
and disadvantages. You must make sure she falls in with the wrong crowd. You
must make sure she leaves that place hating white people, law enforcement,
government, and predominantly white religion more than a trip to the dentist. I
am well acquainted with the college she is attending and happily I can report
you won’t have trouble exposing her to folks like that. The campus is crawling
with them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Jane- To be perfectly direct, you sir have failed
completely. You have allowed your patient two things that will likely lead her
to the Enemy. First of all you allowed her too much time with her thoughts,
honest thoughts nonetheless. Though she grew up among unbelievers she has now
come to the conclusion that there must be a creative intelligence or Supreme
Being. You did nothing whatsoever to distract these thoughts. How stupid of
you! And worse yet, you allowed her to have a real friend. Not one that would
applaud every little piece of sarcastic claptrap that came out of her mouth but
one that truly cared for her and would be honest with her. One that could very
well help lead her to HIM! At one point you realized your mistake and tried to drive
a wedge between her and this friend by using a love triangle. Then you sent her
to an art camp that had the exact type of phony acquaintances that we would
want her to have. It was, I admit, a clever plan EXCEPT THAT IT COMPLETELY
BACKFIRED! If anything she is now far more likely to see through those types of
people. One primary mistake you made was hoping to lead the patient to
corruption by acquainting her with a patient that my cousin is having great
success with. This girl made it all to obvious to your patient where she was
headed and made her lonely for her friend. I offer you no advice but to hand
this patient over to a more experienced practitioner and spend more time in
school. Believe me, you don’t want to lose your patient to the Enemy. My nephew
Wormwood made that mistake once and I’m sure he would warn you about it but
sadly he is unable to do so. I am digesting him as we speak (and may I say the
lad is giving me a rather sour stomach).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Upchuck-
The patient has a streak of perversion a mile long that is uplifting. I take
further delight once again as to how the sins of his parents as well as other
people have given sufficient scandal to lead to grave damage to his soul.
Thanks to a neighbor who liked to change with the curtains open he became
voyeuristic at a very young age. Then there are the parents. I am much pleased
with those two. They did little to stop his perverse attitudes as he was
growing up. In fact they encouraged him (his father in particular). His parents
made no objection to his use of pornography. In fact they felt was an art form
and free speech. Also they taught him that masturbation was not only harmless,
but healthy. I foresee his parents living in our father’s house very soon. And
now he has committed his first act of fornication. It may well seem this
patient is beyond redemption. And yet I wouldn’t be so cocky if I were you.
When our brotherhood discovered the temptation of lust in the early days of man
it was like the greatest gift in the world had been given to us, a gift that
kept on giving. We were deliriously happy. The sixth and ninth commandment
seemed to contain a huge amount of grave and addictive sinful actions. I can’t
tell you how many souls we’ve taken this way. And yet…and yet something seems
to have gone wrong. The perverse among men seem to have shown an alarming rate
of repentance. Some can never break away from their behavior but some are so
shocked by the harm it has inflicted on them and their loved ones that they
have come to seek atonement. Surprisingly large numbers of them have reached
the Enemy and more are continuing to do so. You cannot put all your faith in
the perversion of your patient. Where then can you turn? Ah, the boy has
another weakness. He is a coward. I’m sure you’ve been well educated in the
effects of cowardice on the soul. Besides leading to anger it can cripple
virtue, making true reconciliation a practical impossibility.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I shall address the condition of this patient briefly but first I feel
obligated to share a warning with you and your classmates about your attitude
towards her. I know well that you lust for her. Silly stupid fool, do you not
see what you are doing? Were you not clearly taught that the doctor-patient
relationship must be kept strictly professional in particular when you feel
attraction to the patient? You did read Scupoli, did you not? I once had a dear
friend name Asmodeus. He was a master of our profession and I thought he always
would be. Sadly he has been forced into early retirement. You see, before the
days of the Enemy’s presence on earth he was assigned to a Jewish patient name
Sarah. He got it into his head that she could be driven to suicide. He tried to
study her carefully to see how to accomplish this when he made his fatal
mistake: he fell deeply in lust with her and longed for her affections. He
became obsessed with her to the point where he actually believed he loved her.
When she married, his jealousy knew no bounds. He devised his suicide scheme
unwisely. He killed her husband before there was an opportunity to consummate
the marriage. He did so to the next six men she married. Seven souls
potentially lost to us because of his lust for one. This Enemy was moved to
action. Now to be fair Sarah was strongly tempted towards suicide but resisted because
of the love she had for her family and her strong conscience, which Asmodeus
could not fracture. She still prayed for death but was unwilling to bring it
about herself. The Enemy sent out one of his three most trusted agents, a fiend
named Raphael, to remedy the situation, and that he did. He delivered Sarah a
husband who he had trained to expel demons. Once Asmodeus was exorcised from
her he was alone and vulnerable. Raphael bound him and left him in the desert
where he remains to this day. Let that be a lesson to you. As far as your
patient is concerned I was pleased to see her recent act of fornication. I
suspect she did it more for the sexual attention paid to her than for lust
itself. She also drinks heavily. By all means use that. You see she is also
proud and if she becomes an alcoholic she will not want to turn to any group
that would have her rely on a higher power. You are also to continue to present
to her a bad image of Christians. Her own parents claim to be Christians but
act hypocritically. I say to you all once again that the sins of the parents
are a beautiful thing. Make sure that she comes across no positive images of
Christianity. Keep in mind your patient believes in and fears hell (ironically
enough her classmates often mistake her for a worshiper of our father). Should
this become a problem there is a common yet simple solution. Emphasize
spirituality but not religion. Make sure she lives not by the rules of any
legitimate religion but by her own (or more to the point, ours).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

The patient is supposedly a Baptist. In his mind he believes no confessor is
needed for the forgiveness of sin. He does believe one must truly repent to be
forgiven. This is where you strike. Do this sound familiar: “If Loving You Is
Wrong I Don’t Want To Be Right”? You’d be amazed how many people who consider
themselves religious will try to either make up their own rules about right and
wrong in defiance of their faith or take a proud stubborn attitude about
particular sins they’ve committed and refuse to repent. On three occasions he
fornicated with his girlfriend. He lost his virginity to her. He knows these
acts to be sinful but regards them as precious memories and important
milestones in his life. By no means is this his only offense but it gives you a
general idea of how you can get to him. He is more selfish than anyone who
knows him might suspect and considers his own wants often above the Ten
Commandments. Sometimes he doesn’t even try to justify himself. I’ve actually
heard him thinking, “Well then I’ll just go to hell” Deep down I don’t think he
really believes it. And his image of our kind and our domain is hardly
accurate. He, like so many Americans, sees us as cartoonish figures with red
pajamas and pitchforks. This deception is very helpful for us. He must not be
allowed to contemplate on what hell really is like. ALSO ABOVE ALL ELSE NEVER
LET HIM CONTEMPLATE THE CONCEPT OF ETERNITY. We are often laughed off because
humans think they can handle discomfort. They handle it only because any suffering
they go through is temporary. If one of them stopped to think for just one
minute what is would be like to suffer eternally, even if they underestimate
the agony here, it would be disastrous.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

With this patient you have made a couple serious mistakes. You see he is not
only very selfish but he is stupid. He lives with his own pleasure in mind and
seems to get just what he wants. He must continue to do so. He must prosper all
his life and sit in the lap of luxury. Your mistakes were to allow him to
injure his knee and flunk high school. IT MADE HIM THINK! Patients like him are
best left to seek their own pleasure and to succeed immensely in life while
often bringing misery to others. Think about it. He has been rich, athletic,
popular, good-looking, and spoiled. He’s committed plenty of sins but
everything desirable that could happen to him has, so why should he bother
giving even a moment’s thought to his life? If you cause him suffering HE JUST
MIGHT! Let’s try to put him back on top of the world as soon as we can, ok? And
as for Brittany, well she might not be the best influence for him. She’s gotten
a little smarter and developed self-respect. He wants a girlfriend for two
reasons and two reasons only: status and sex. She is beginning to want more out
of life and he would be happier if she was mute and a tad bit more loose. It
won’t happen, so you need to find him the kind of woman that is twice as
attractive as Brittany and three times as dumb. He doesn’t want a real woman,
he wants a Barbie doll. He must be made to enjoy life. Inevitably, he will
eventually face misery for the way he lives. Let’s hope he is either dead by
then or too corrupted to change. If not, try anything you can to prevent him
from reaching any proper conclusions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

This girl is beginning to find self-worth. She thought of herself as a mere sex
object before. Why did you allow her attitude to change? She would have sinned
continually and at the first signs of old age gone into despair. She might have
even killed herself. She is starting to discover true pleasures and that is
something that absolutely must not happen. Try afflicting her with guilt and
self-hatred. We’ll see what that does to her attitude. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Daria:
In your letters you have expressed concern over her attitude, which seems to be
improving somewhat. I wouldn’t worry too much. She still is quite flippant,
cynical, and still holds humans in general in low esteem. It was quite lucky
for us she wound up going to college in Boston. Few states have as many liberals
as Massachusetts. Why liberals, you may ask? Won’t she suffer more around
conservative classmates? Why, liberals seem so well intentioned; they seem to
want to help people. True, but it was wisely said that the road to hell is
paved with good intentions. Liberals have a few major flaws we’ve managed to
exploit. One is that they tend to believe the end justifies the means. Another
is that they work so hard to save some people from other people that they seem
to hold human nature itself in low regard. Thus kind-hearted people can become
nasty, suspicious, and unethical. Oh the things we can do to people. And even
better, think about what people like that will do to you patient’s view of
life. I would caution you to make sure she spends as little time as possible
with her friend for both their sakes. She needs to be with people who will show
her that life is one big joke and that people in general are stupid jerks. What
do you think her chances of reaching the Enemy are with that sort of mindset?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>In
conclusion let me give you a few crucially important reminders. First and
foremost, we WILL lose the war with heaven. You didn’t think they enemy had any
intention of setting himself up to lose, did you? This is a forgone conclusion.
Thus it becomes extremely important that we win every battle we can. The only
harm we can inflict on the Enemy is to rob him of his favorite possessions (a
place of honor we once held, I remind you). Secondly, the truth is our enemy.
Never ever let your patient see the truth unless you intend to mix portions of
it with deception. Third of all, try to make your patients as introverted as
possible at all times. And fourth and most important of all DO NOT LOSE YOUR
PATIENT TO THE ENEMY! Anyone who makes that blunder will be sent to the career
counselor, that gentleman over there with the guillotine. Good luck to all of
you. You’ll need it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
