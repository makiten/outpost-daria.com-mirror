The Stone<BR>
<BR>
&lt;Saturday, 
High Hills Park 2 AM&gt;<BR>
<BR>
The man crept through the bushes 
surrounding High Hills Park as
quietly as he could. He doubted anyone 
could see him, but it didn't
hurt to be careful. After all, if he got 
caught he couldn't finish
the job. And that was what was important, 
the job. He adjusted
the bag slung over his shoulder, the last one 
hadn't weighed so
much. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Or am I just growing 
old?&quot; He wondered. The man nearly
giggled when he realized what 
he was thinking about, but caught
himself. He wasn't focusing on the 
job, that was bad, he might
fail if he didn't focus, and failure 
wasn't an option. He looked
around, the location seemed like it would 
work, it felt right.
He set the bag down and opened it. He reached 
into the bag to
withdraw the inert form inside. Taking great care not 
to disturb
the body too much he removed the bag and tossed it aside. 
Let
the police puzzle over it, he didn't want it anymore. He 
looked
down at the body lying on the ground. If one didn't know any 
better
a person might think the boy was already dead. He wasn't of 
course,
the man had started by killing the boys first, but that just 
wasn't
the right way. The dead are beyond a mere mortal's ability 
to
punish. He kicked the boy in the ribs, it also wasn't as good
if 
they weren't awake, for the start at least, the pain cause
most of 
them to pass out rather quickly. The boy's eyes shot open
with pain, 
his ribs were definitely bruised, and most likely 
broken.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You've been a bad boy, hiding out with the 
normal people,
but now it's time to pay the piper. Pretty boys like 
you always
do.&quot; He withdrew the large knife he kept razor sharp 
and
began inflicting his final punishment. When he was done he 
left
the carcass where it lay. He idly looked at the blood 
stained
knife. It had gone well, but maybe next time he'd try 
working
indoors, so he could hear the boy's cries for help. A feral 
smile
crept across the man's face, what had started out as a job 
was
turning out to be quite fun. He walked up to his lookout spot
a 
fair distance from the site of the punishment and settled in.
There 
were still quite a few hours until sunrise so he could get
some rest 
before anyone came across the corpse. And if he slept
through the 
discovery, well, that was what the camcorder was 
for.
<BR>
<BR>
&lt;Saturday, High Hills Park, 10AM&gt;<BR>
<BR>
It 
all started innocently enough, Jane wanted to paint some 
landscapes
and I wanted to get out of the house for a while. 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Let's go to the park,&quot; she said, &quot;I haven't 
been
to the park in ages.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I agreed because, let's 
face it, this is Lawndale we're talking
about, nothing happens here, 
boy was I wrong there. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh come on Daria, you can pose 
for at least one picture.
It's not like I'm going to swallow your 
soul or anything.&quot;
Jane had been bugging me to do some poses 
from famous works of
art, in part I guess because she knew it would 
nettle me. Jane
was always doing that, pecking and poking at me. I 
think she was
trying to find out if I really was incapable of human 
emotion,
or something. But I digress. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;You're out of 
your cotton-picking mind if you think I'm
going to pose for one of 
your paintings willingly...&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Then why don't we 
try for a different style of poses? I'm
sure Tom would approve,&quot; 
Jane said with a leer.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Go to hell Jane,&quot; I shot 
back. &quot;I'll be over there
reading, let me know when you want to 
go.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Want to grab a slice or two 
afterwards?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Always,&quot; I replied as I turned 
away from Jane. I walked
a short distance, through a copse of trees 
and over a small ridge.
I was headed for what looked to be a nice 
secluded place to read.
My only hope at that time was that the spot 
hadn't already attracted
horny teens, a common problem I faced in my 
pursuit of solitude.
In all honesty I'm not quite sure what that says 
about me. But
again, that's not really important, I guess I'm just 
trying to
avoid what comes next. I crested the small ridge and looked 
down
into the small hollow, and that's where I saw it.<BR>
<BR>
No, 
that's where I saw him, or at least, his remains. Lying in
the middle 
of the clearing was a naked, mangled corpse. I wanted
to scream, to 
run, to do something, but I couldn't. My feet were
glued to the blood 
soaked ground and my eyes were riveted on the
corpse. <BR>
<BR>
The 
kid, because that's what he was, someone my age, was a wreck,
that 
much was obvious. His eyes were open that much I remember
clearly. 
The rest of him...shredded. He had not died well, even
I could tell 
that. Part of me wanted to see if he was still alive,
but I knew that 
wasn't true. The gaping hole in his chest told
me that much. All I 
could think of was slaughtered beef. I don't
know how long I stood 
there before it dawned on me that I knew
the person. Well, that might 
imply too strong a connection. I
recognized his face, or at least 
what was left of it, from school.
He was in my English class, but I 
couldn't remember his name.
Just another one of the nameless rabble 
who moved through the
halls around me, lost in their own little 
world, only now he didn't
have a face. He was nothing more than a 
thing now, chopped up
and waiting to be shipped wherever. 
<BR>
<BR>
As I stood there, rooted to the ground, I thought I could 
hear
something, a voice. It started out softly, a faint whisper. 
I
tried, but was unable to make out what the voice was saying. 
Gradually
it grew louder, but I still couldn't make out any distinct 
words.
It was like someone was trying to speak to me from across a 
large
distance. I looked around furiously, trying to find the 
source
of the voice. The longer I stood there the more I felt the 
madness
of the scene leach into me. It felt like the blood from the 
ground
had seeped through my boots and was rising up to seize my 
brain.<BR>
<BR>
I shook my head to rid myself of the fuzziness that 
had crept
into my mind. I wanted to run, how I wanted to run. Every 
fiber
of my body was screaming at me to run, and never look back. 
But
my feet remained firmly attached to the ground.<BR>
<BR>
A robin 
landed on a nearby tree and started chirping. That simple
sound of 
life was enough to break my paralysis and I ran away
from that 
clearing faster than I had ever run in my life. I saw
Jane and I made 
a beeline for her. Jane looked up from her painting
and instantly saw 
that something was not right.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Daria, what's wrong? You 
look like you've seen a ghost.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Body, copse, 
call police,&quot; I gasped out. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Whoa, slow down 
there.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I took a deep breath and tried again, 
&quot;There's a body back
there in a copse of trees, we need to call 
the police.&quot; I
was amazed at how calm my voice 
sounded.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Holy shit!&quot; Jane shouted, &quot;A body, 
as in a corpse?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
I nodded, &quot;As in the body of 
that kid you like to stare at
in English.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Fuck, 
someone we know?&quot; Jane took a deep breath. &quot;Ok,
let's go 
call the cops.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
We flagged down some yuppie and 
convinced her to let us borrow
her cell phone. I talked to the cops 
since I had made the discovery.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;911, what is the 
emergency?&quot; The polite, but officious
voice on the other end 
asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'd, uh, like to report a homicide. I was 
walking in High
Hills Park and found a 
body.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This had better not be a prank 
call.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's not, my name is Daria Morgendorffer. 
If you don't believe
me send a squad car to High Hills Park and I'll 
be happy to show
you.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Look Miss, there hasn't 
been a murder in Lawndale in years.
Are you sure you didn't see a 
drunk sleeping?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Most drunks don't sleep naked 
with their faces cut off and
left lying beside them,&quot; I replied 
evenly. Jane's eyebrows
shot up when she heard that. <BR>
<BR>
The 
voice on the other end was quiet for a long moment. 
&quot;Okay
ma'am,&quot; the dispatcher said finally. &quot;I'm 
sending a
patrol car to High Hills Park immediately. Could you meet 
the
officers at the entrance of the park and show them where the 
body
is?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ok, I can do 
that.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Thank-you for calling 
911.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm sorry I had to,&quot; I muttered into 
the phone before
handing it back to the yuppie, who stared at me a 
long moment
before running off.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What's the 
scoop?&quot; Jane asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We wait for the cops to show 
up,&quot; I replied. &quot;Look
Jane, you don't have to stay if you 
don't want to. This could
take a while.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;And 
what kind of friend would that make me?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I suppose if 
I wasn't so emotionally numb by that time Jane's
comment would have 
pleased me. &quot;Come on, let's walk over
to the entrance.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I take it the corpse was particularly gruesome,&quot; 
Jane
said as a question while we walked to the entrance of the 
park.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It was...&quot; I began when all of a sudden I 
could hear
that voice and the madness that lay behind it. 
&quot;...can we
not talk about it,&quot; I said finally. So long as I 
didn't think
about the body I was fine. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ok, if you're 
sure you don't want to talk about.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I am,&quot; 
I snapped. We walked the rest of the way with
an uncomfortable 
silence hanging over us. There was nothing else
to do but wait for 
the approaching sirens to arrive.<BR>
<BR>
&lt;Saturday, Quantico, VA 
12 P.M.&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I was reviewing a case file for a court date 
when I heard a knock
on my door. &quot;Come in,&quot; I 
shouted.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hey Steve.&quot; I glanced up and saw my boss 
handing me
a case file. &quot;There's been<BR>
another 
one.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; I replied, I knew this was 
coming. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We're going to need you to go out 
there.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;AD Schoenweis 
says you'll be SAC on scene.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah.&quot; With a 
resigned sigh I took the folder and started
flipping through it. 
&quot;Where'd it happen?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The town's called 
Lawndale, typical rich suburb town.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
I nodded, I knew 
the type. &quot;Where was the drop?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;In a local 
park, the site itself is pretty secluded.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Are 
the locals playing ball?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They haven't even moved 
the body.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
My eyebrows raised involuntarily, 
&quot;That's damn nice of them.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;To be honest I 
don't think they know what to do with it.
I just got off the phone 
with the local chief, they haven't had
a murder in the town in over a 
decade.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I sighed and stood up. My bag was already 
packed and sitting by
the door, &quot;Well now it's just been a 
couple hours. Does Sarah
and the rest of the team 
know?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They're waiting for you.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I 
walked to the door. &quot;Who found the body?&quot; I 
asked.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Some kid.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Shit,&quot; I 
breathed.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Do I tell 
him?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Her.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Do I tell 
her?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Steve, we haven't even decided if he is 
targeting them.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Still, do I tell 
her?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Have to ask the boss 
that.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Lousy way to run a case,&quot; I 
grunted.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Lousy case.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; 
I agreed<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Better get going, the plane's waiting for 
you.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; One of the perks of working 
the highest profile
case at the Bureau was the exclusive use of a 
Department of Justice
jet. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hey 
Steve.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Catch the 
bastard, ok?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I walked out of my office, 
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&lt;Saturday, Lawndale Police 
Headquarters, 6 PM&gt; <BR>
<BR>
After they interviewed me the 
detectives left me in a break room
with a cup of coffee. Jane had 
long since been sent home. My repeated
inquiries as to why they 
weren't letting me go home, or the location
of my parents were met 
with stony silence. This left me with plenty
of time to mull over the 
interview. Which had gone quite well,
all things considered. I told 
them as much as I could without
stirring up the voice, or the 
madness. It was all I could do from
breaking down completely as it 
was. I think they were an inch
away from bringing in a shrink, which 
was something I definitely
did not want to happen. So I told them the 
basics: found a body,
body was fucked up. That seemed to placate them 
and I wound up
in the break room. I was staring out at the squad room 
when a
man walked in. He wasn't a local, that much I could tell, 
but
he did seem to belong in the room. He was wearing a dark suit
and 
trench coat that had the same rumpled look my dad's clothes
had when 
he got back from a business trip. I watched as he walked
up to one of 
the detectives and flashed a badge while addressing
the officers. The 
detectives pointed in my direction and the man
walked into the break 
room. I quickly focused on my attention
on the coffee mug. 
<BR>
<BR>
He didn't speak to me at first, instead he placed a manila 
folder
on the table. He hung his trench coat on a coat rack and 
poured
himself a cup of coffee. I noticed he used a Styrofoam cup 
instead
of one of the mugs. Only then did he sit down at the table 
across
from me. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hello there Daria,&quot; he said 
without consulting the
folder. &quot;My name is Steven Fraser,&quot; 
he pronounced it
Frazer. &quot;I'm a Special Agent with the FBI. I've 
been assigned
to work on this case.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Can I see 
some identification please?&quot; I said coolly,
anything to delay 
the inevitable interview.<BR>
<BR>
He didn't miss a beat, &quot;Sure 
thing.&quot; He reached into
his jacket and I could see the butt of 
his pistol when the jacket
flashed open. &quot;Here you go.&quot; He 
handed me a leather
wallet. I opened it up and stared dumbly at the 
lamented photo,
and the bold &quot;Federal Bureau of 
Investigation.&quot; I ran
my fingers over the badge, impressing the 
texture of the metal
into my fingers. &quot;Satisfied I am who I 
claim to be?&quot;
He asked.<BR>
<BR>
I closed the wallet and handed 
it back. &quot;For now, but you
can never be too 
careful.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Fraser chuckled ruefully, &quot;No you 
can't.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Something clicked in my mind. &quot;This was 
that guy who's been
on the news wasn't it? That's why the FBI is 
involved.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Fraser looked at me appraisingly, it was 
very unnerving, &quot;The
file said you were quick, that's good. Yes 
it's that guy. The
body you found was his seventh 
victim.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Wonderful.&quot; Suddenly Lawndale 
didn't seem quite as
insular as it had before. &quot;So if you know 
who did it why
am I still here? And while we're on the subject where 
are my parents?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;To answer your first question 
you're here because I want
to talk to you. Your parents aren't here 
because I said they couldn't
be.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I stiffened, 
&quot;Why the hell not?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Because I'm trying to 
keep you out of the public eye. The
tabloids have already shown up 
and the mainstream press isn't
far off. Do you really want to speak 
to Wolf Blitzer right now?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well 
no.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I thought so.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Now 
what?&quot; I asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Now we 
talk.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;About what?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
He leaned back 
in his chair, &quot;Whatever you want to talk 
about.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
I looked at him a long time as I digested that 
statement. Agent
Fraser was not an overly tall man, no more than six 
feet. He did
seem to be in extremely good shape, not like a 
bodybuilder, but
there was a certain solidity to his physique. His 
light brown
hair was close cropped, in an almost military fashion. 
The clothes
he wore looked well tailored and expensive, though that 
wasn't
my area of expertise. All told the man radiated a calm 
professionalism,
from his clear blue eyes to the relaxed way he held 
his coffee
cup.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why do you care?&quot; I asked 
finally. &quot;I just found
a body. It's not like I saw the 
killer.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This is true, but you did find the body. 
You saw the scene
exactly as the killer intended, and that's 
something I need to
know.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Are you one of those 
profilers?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
He smiled and shook his head, &quot;No, I'm 
just a guy who can
shoot straight. But this killer likes to stage his 
victims and
every tiny detail you can relate to me will help the real 
investigators
get inside this guy's head and help us stop him, 
hopefully before
he kills another person.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As Fraser 
talked I could feel the madness come creeping back into
my mind. I 
gripped the mug tightly.<BR>
<BR>
Fraser noticed, &quot;Daria, is 
something wrong?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;No, I'm 
fine.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You know, that's the other reason I'm 
here.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;What?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;To make sure 
you're ok.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I didn't know the FBI was in the 
mental health field.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are when it involves 
one our witnesses.&quot; He smiled
briefly. &quot;Seriously, you saw 
an intensely gruesome thing
today. We want to make sure you don't 
become another casualty.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm not 
suicidal.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Agent Fraser shrugged, &quot;I'm sure you're 
not, but it's been
known to happen to even the most stable, and 
hardened investigator.
Mental trauma does funny things to a 
person.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
There was a knock and the door opened before I 
could respond to
Agent Fraser. A woman stuck her head in the room. 
&quot;Hey Steve,
the body's on its way to the morgue, Grisman and the 
others are
still going over the scene with the locals. I'm about to 
head
out and start on the autopsy.&quot; She told Agent 
Fraser.<BR>
<BR>
Agent Fraser noticed my horror-struck expression 
when the woman
said autopsy. He smiled apologetically, &quot;Agent 
Raines, why
don't you come in here and introduce yourself to Daria 
Morgendorffer,
the girl who found the body.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The woman 
looked in my direction and apparently noticed me for
the first time. 
&quot;Shit, sorry about that.&quot; She entered
the room fully and 
walked over to the table. &quot;Hi there, I'm
Special Agent Sarah 
Raines. I'm the lead forensic agent in this
case. It's nice to meet 
you.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Before I responded I looked the woman over 
carefully. She was
wearing an expensive looking pants suit that my 
mother would have
loved. She wasn't very tall, only around five foot 
two or so.
Her blonde hair was kept in a simple shoulder length pony 
tail.
She was a very attractive woman by all accounts, but like 
Agent
Fraser, there was an element of hardened professionalism to 
her
demeanor. I shook her hand hesitantly. &quot;Hello Agent 
Raines.
So, you're the person who's going to be doing the autopsy on 
the
person I found?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
She nodded, &quot;That's right, 
normally in a homicide the local
coroner would do the job, but since 
this is a special case I get
to do the honors.&quot; She had a soft 
voice, but there was a
great deal of force behind it.<BR>
<BR>
As she 
talked I could see in my mind's eye this woman taking a
circular saw 
to the corpse. It all seemed so, dehumanizing. I
couldn't remember 
the boy's name, but at least had a few points
of reference in common, 
I certainly knew him better than these
FBI agents did. &quot;Do you 
know who the person I found is?&quot;
I asked simply.<BR>
<BR>
Agent 
Raines shook her head, &quot;Not yet, he obviously didn't
have any ID 
on him, his fingerprints aren't on record, and his
face is mangled 
almost beyond recognition. One of the first things
I'm going to do is 
take some dental casts. Other than that we
just wait for someone to 
call.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Inwardly I shuddered, whoever he was no-one was 
looking out for
him now. He was lying on a slab somewhere and his 
parents didn't
even know it. &quot;It's all so unfair,&quot; I 
muttered to myself.<BR>
<BR>
Agent Raines seemed to pick up on my 
discomfort, &quot;Well I've
got a lot of work to do so I should be 
heading over to the hospital.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Do you want the 
keys to the car?&quot; Agent Fraser asked
her.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's 
ok, I can get a local to drive me over. It was nice
meeting you 
Daria,&quot; she told me, smiling.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Uhm, 
likewise.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'll catch up with you when you're 
done here, right Steve?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Agent Fraser nodded, 
&quot;Yeah, that's the plan.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ok, I'll see you 
then, bye Daria, and don't worry, you're
in good hands. Agent 
Fraser's the best.&quot; She walked out of
the room and closed the 
door behind her.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Uhm, sorry about that,&quot; Agent 
Fraser said apologetically.
&quot;Agent Raines is very good at her 
job, but in cases like
this we tend to charge headlong at the problem 
so things like
private conversations come 
second.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Could I watch the autopsy?&quot; I asked 
hesitantly.<BR>
<BR>
Agent Fraser shook his head, &quot;I don't think 
that would be
a good idea. Autopsies are a nasty business, you 
wouldn't like
what you'd see, trust me.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I...just 
feel like I should see it,&quot; I said firmly.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Daria, 
have you ever seen a real autopsy?&quot; I shook
my head, &quot;It's 
a messy job, are you really sure you want
to see Agent Raines scalp 
the victim, then peel the flesh back
over his face so she can scoop 
the brain out with an ice cream
scoop?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I swallowed the 
bile back down, &quot;Uhm, no, I guess not.&quot;
Some things that 
kid had to go through on his own. &quot;So do
you want to hear about 
the crime scene?&quot; I asked him coldly.
The sooner I could be free 
of these FBI agents the better.<BR>
<BR>
Fraser looked around the 
break room, &quot;You know, you've been
in this station long enough, 
let's get you home. We can talk about
it there. I'm sure your parents 
are worried sick about you.&quot;
Fraser stood up and offered me a 
hand.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And what about the press 
outside?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We can go out the backdoor, I've got a 
car waiting there.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You've got everything all 
planned out don't you?&quot; I
asked as I stood up.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I 
try.&quot; He motioned to the door, &quot;Shall we go?&quot;
I 
followed him out of the break room.<BR>
<BR>
&lt; Saturday, High 
Hills Park 3pm&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Lawndale was everything I expected it to 
be, your typical bastion
of suburban conformity. I pulled the rental 
car into the crime
scene's parking lot.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Nice 
place,&quot; my passenger, Special Agent Sarah Raines,
commented. 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I hate the suburbs,&quot; I said evenly as I adjusted 
my
sunglasses. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh come one Steve, you're going to 
have to settle down someday.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Only if it's with 
you.&quot; I replied, we've dated a little
in the past. 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;In your dreams buddy.&quot; She shot back with a 
smile.
<BR>
<BR>
We walked up to the entrance of the park. A uniform 
cop met us
there. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sorry folks, park's 
closed.<BR>
<BR>
I took my badge out, &quot;I'm Special Agent Fraser, 
this is my
partner, Special Agent Raines. I believe you were told to 
expect
us?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The cops demeanor changed totally when he 
saw the letters FBI.
&quot;Oh, right yes sir, you can pass.&quot; He 
raised the yellow
police tape. &quot;I'll radio for someone to come 
and show you
the crime scene.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Thank-you,&quot; 
Sarah said warmly. She's always been better
with the locals than me. 
It's probably due to the fact that she's
attractive and has breasts. 
<BR>
<BR>
I surveyed the park while we waited. It was a park, no 
different
from a thousand others I'd been in. A half-hearted attempt 
by
the citizens of the town to remind themselves that the world 
did
not start out covered in asphalt and concrete. It was a 
pleasant
enough place, if that was your thing, lightly forested with 
a
slight roll to the terrain. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Great place to dump a 
body,&quot; I observed. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Killer thought so too,&quot; 
Sarah reminded me. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ok, so we've got a drop in the 
park, what's that tell us?&quot;
I asked. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Parks are 
public, lots of people moving through during the
day. They represent 
families, childhood, innocence. Do you think
any of those are 
motivators?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I shrugged, &quot;that's your job, not 
mine.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'll know more when we see the site, but 
if this our guy
it sounds like he's escalating. From what I've heard 
the wounds
to the victim are much more severe than with any of the 
others.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Fuck, and if it's 
not?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We've got a 
copycat.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Shit.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I know, 
let's just hope it is a copycat, and he was sloppy.
Otherwise it 
could get messy.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And you're not the one who's 
ass is going to be in a sling
if there is another 
killing.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Don't come crying to me about Bureau 
pressure, you volunteered
to lead the 
investigation.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hey, it was either going to be me 
or Adams, now who would
you rather work 
with?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why Fox Mulder, of course. He'd have this 
case solved by
now, thanks to his brilliant mind and nigh-psychic 
intuition.
Which would leave us plenty of time for staring soulfully 
into
each other's eyes.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I snorted derisively, 
&quot;Right, and I'd like to have Dana Scully
as my forensic expert. 
We would have wrapped this one up long
ago and now she'd be showing 
me exactly why red heads are more
fun.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;You do 
know she's a dye job right?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Gillian Anderson is 
a dye job, Dana Scully is a natural
red head,&quot; I replied 
smugly.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You're incorrigible 
Steve.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm not the one who brought up the topic. 
That was all you.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;At least I didn't resort to 
the lowest denominator, my intentions
for Mulder are as pure as the 
driven snow.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Bullshit, you'd have that boy tied 
up and playing that kinky
S&amp;M shit you like in a 
heartbeat.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm not a dominatrix!&quot; Sarah 
shot back, a little too
loudly if the expression of officer who'd 
just arrived was any
indication. He coughed decorously, causing Sarah 
to whirl around
and face him. Her face colored 
instantly.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Uh Agents Fraser and Raines?&quot; He 
asked, discussions
of kinky sex were obviously things he didn't 
expect to hear from
federal agents. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's us, I'm 
Fraser, she's Raines.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm Officer Graham, I was 
sent to show you the crime scene.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Great, well 
not great that you to show us to a...oh, to
hell with it, where's the 
body?&quot; I spluttered.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh very smooth,&quot; Sarah 
whispered in my ear as we followed
the cop. &quot;I'm sure that just 
bolstered his image of the FBI.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Like you were 
much better, shouting 'I'm not a dominatrix'
at the top of your 
lungs.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That was your fault, now if you'll excuse 
me I'll try to
salvage the situation. Officer Graham right?&quot; She 
asked the
cop. He nodded, &quot;What can you tell us about who's been 
to
the crime scene?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Graham shrugged, &quot;Some 
paramedics, a few detectives, a photographer,
and the person who 
first found the body.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And nobody has touched the 
corpse, right?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Graham shook his head, &quot;Just to 
check for a pulse.&quot;
He paused, &quot;Well one of the paramedics 
did put a tarp over
it, it was a little too creepy just lying 
there.&quot; He lead
us to a small thicket surrounded by police tape. 
A small cluster
of detectives and a uniformed officer stood outside 
the grove.
One of the detectives saw us approach and walked towards 
us.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hello, I'm Detective Andy Secor, you must be the 
FBI Agents?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Special Agents Fraser and Raines, 
we're the lead pair. The
rest of my forensic team will be along 
shortly.&quot; We all shook
hands. &quot;Detective I'd like to 
explain to you what's about
to happen. My team consists of four other 
field agents, plus a
couple of technicians. We're going to do 
everything we can to
help you. We want to see this son of a bitch 
arrested, but we
don't care who does it. There are going to be times 
when it looks
like we're cutting you out of the loop, but we aren't 
you'll have
to trust me on that.&quot; I like to be as up front as 
possible
with local police, they respond well to 
it.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Thanks for letting me know where things stand. So, 
want
to see it?&quot; Secor asked needlessly. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Damn 
silly of us to come this far and not,&quot; I replied.
<BR>
<BR>
The 
detective held up the tape line for us and we entered the
grove. 
&quot;Show time,&quot; I muttered to Sarah as we both pulled
latex 
gloves from our pockets. I could see the body in the center
of the 
clearing but didn't approach it. Instead I walked around
the glade to 
get a better feel for the place.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Was that path the 
only way people have entered and exited?&quot;
Sarah 
asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yes,&quot; Secor replied, &quot;Why do you 
ask?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Because any other stray footprints will be 
the killer's,&quot;
I answered. <BR>
<BR>
Sarah walked over to the 
tarp and gingerly uncovered the body.
I could hear the detective 
wretch.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ok, we've got one Caucasian male. Age between 
fifteen and
twenty. Cause of death, rough guess massive hemorrhaging. 
I'll
know more when I get the body back to the 
morgue.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I nodded, half-listening, &quot;Is it our 
guy?&quot; I still hadn't
looked at the body, Sarah had a better 
stomach for that sort of
thing. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah, wound patterns 
are a match, same exaggerated mutilation.
It's our 
guy.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Fucking wonderful,&quot; I grumbled as I 
scanned the ground
surrounding the clearing. My eyes caught a shape 
hidden under
a bush. &quot;Hey Sarah, I think I found 
something.&quot; I carefully
walked over to the bush. &quot;One large 
burlap sack, body sized.&quot;
I planted a flag next to the bag, the 
rest of the evidence team
would photograph, then remove the bag. 
<BR>
<BR>
Hunkering down, I methodically examined the surrounding 
brush,
looking for footprints. &quot;Got a couple foot impressions 
too.&quot;
I ran a hand over one of the boot marks. &quot;The killer 
came
from this direction with the victim in the bag. Was the 
victim
dead yet?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Sarah shrugged, &quot;I can't tell 
that yet, ask me after the
autopsy. But given the amount of blood on 
the ground I'd say no.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ok, so the victim was 
probably unconscious. The killer takes
him here, 
why?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's a park, a public space, a good place 
for a spectacle.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
I nodded, &quot;But what good's a 
spectacle if you don't see it?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You think he's 
watching?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It wouldn't surprise me. Have them run 
a check on possible
sight lines based on the position of the 
body.&quot; The rest
of the investigation team started to enter the 
grove. I motioned
for Agent Paul Grisman, the senior agent on the 
team to talk to
me.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah boss?&quot; Grisman 
asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There's a bag and some footprints over there, 
check 'em
out first.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Grisman nodded, &quot;Ok, 
anything else?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I shrugged, &quot;The local PD seems 
pretty content to let us
run the show. I want you guys to survey the 
hell out of the scene,
and get the corpse out of here ASAP, it's 
starting to smell.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ok, I'll let Crawford deal 
with the body, he's new, it'll
do him good. Pemberton and Lewis can 
handle the surveying and
I'll deal with the bag.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I 
nodded in assent, &quot;Sounds good. Ok people,&quot; I called
out, 
&quot;We are now on the clock, let's work the case, find
the evidence 
and catch this bastard<BR>
<BR>
I started to leave the crime scene. 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Sarah 
asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Forensics aren't my thing. I think I'll go talk 
to our witness.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&lt;Morgendorffer Residence, 6:30 
PM&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Agent Fraser drove me home in a nondescript rental 
sedan. He tried
to fill time by chatting with me. It was an extremely 
one-sided
conversation.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;...So I joined the Bureau to 
put my skills to good use,
and so far it's proven to be a challenging 
and rewarding career
decision. How about you, what do you want to do 
after college?&quot;
I noticed he didn't say &quot;When you grow 
up.&quot; I didn't
bother responding. &quot;Don't know, am I 
right?&quot; He was,
but that wasn't the point. Fraser chuckled, 
&quot;That's ok, you
don't have to know right now, I didn't.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's my house on the right,&quot; I said quickly. 
By that
time I was ready to say any house was mine, just to get out 
of
that car. He drove into the driveway and turned the car off. 
&quot;Thanks
for the ride home, I'll keep in 
touch.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Not so fast, I'm coming with 
you.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Because I want to 
talk to your parents, and you still haven't
told me about the crime 
scene.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Can't we do this tomorrow? I'm uh feeling 
sort of tired.&quot;
The one thing I didn't want to do was talk about 
that damn clearing,
especially at home.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Nope, sorry. 
It's best to do it now.&quot; He walked back
to the truck on the car 
and retrieved a briefcase. &quot;After
you.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I walked 
up to the door and let myself into the house, &quot;Mom,
Dad, I'm 
home,&quot; I called out. The response was startling;
my parents came 
bursting out of the kitchen.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Daria! You're safe. You 
didn't come home, and then we heard
about the murder in the park. So 
I called the police, but they
wouldn't tell me anything, lousy 
police, it's not right, keeping
a father in the dark like that. Gah 
dammit!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yes, the police have a lot of explaining 
to do,&quot; Mom
mused. &quot;They only told me you were at the 
station, but wouldn't
tell me why. Whoever made that decision is 
going to pay.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Actually, that was my decision 
Mrs. Morgendorffer,&quot;
Agent Fraser said calmly.<BR>
<BR>
Helen 
gave Agent Fraser the full brunt of her lawyer stare. &quot;And
who 
might you be? Not to mention what gives you the right to detain
my 
daughter?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Fraser reached for his ID and showed it to 
my parents. &quot;I'm
Special Agent Steven Fraser, FBI. I apologize 
for keeping the
two of you in the dark for so long, but it was 
necessary.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The FBI? I swear I had no idea 
Espinoza was backed by Colombian
drug lords!&quot; Dad 
shouted.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And attorney-client privileges prevent me 
from talking to
you about the Trans-Global- Mega-Corp case,&quot; Mom 
added hastily.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Relax Mr. and Mrs. Morgendorffer I'm 
with the Investigative
Support Unit.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's a 
relief...wait a minute, what does that have to
do with Daria?&quot; 
Dad asked, in a rare moment of lucidity.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There was a 
murder in the park,&quot; I said evenly. &quot;I
found the 
body.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh my god! Daria, how awful, are you 
alright?&quot; Mom
shouted. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why don't we continue the 
conversation in the kitchen, maybe
over a cup of coffee?&quot; Agent 
Fraser asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Uh sure, the kitchen is this way,&quot; 
Dad said. We all
walked into the kitchen and sat around the kitchen 
table. Mom
and Dad madesure I was sitting squarely between 
them<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Okay, your daughter found the latest victim of a 
signature
killer we've been investigating for the past five months. 
The
current victim brings the killer's total up to seven, that 
we
know of...&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;That you know of? You mean you 
don't know how many people
this monster has 
killed?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Quite honestly no Mr. Morgendorffer. 
With offenders like
this it's typical for them to take some time to 
settle on a specific
target. They'll kill a bum then hide the body 
for instance. In
any event we're sorting through every unsolved 
homicide in the
VICAP system hoping to find something 
there.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well what do you know?&quot; I 
asked.<BR>
<BR>
Fraser shrugged, &quot;Not as much as we'd like, 
obviously. The
killer is mostly likely a white male. Age thirty to 
forty. He's
over six feet in height, weight greater than 200 pounds. 
He's
left-handed, has lots of rage, possibly has strong 
homophobic
tendencies and almost certainly has parental issues. He's 
trying
to make a statement with the killings. He probably has a 
history
of harassing gay men.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Were the kids 
gay?&quot; My dad asked.<BR>
<BR>
Fraser shook his head, 
&quot;There's nothing to suggest that,
but all of the victims have 
been good looking, sometimes to the
point of being effeminate. The 
level of violence, as well as certain
other factors, suggest that the 
killer is punishing the victims.
Plus he left a note with the second 
victim, that read like a homophobic
diatribe, that was when we were 
called in.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What factors?&quot; Mom asked in full 
lawyer mode. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Autopsy results show that the mutilation 
is done while the
victims are still alive,&quot; Fraser said evenly. 
We all started
at the agent in mute horror. Dad turned a little 
green. &quot;Now
Daria, why don't you tell me what you saw.&quot; 
Fraser said while
taking a tape recorder out of his 
briefcase.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You're going to depose my daughter in my 
kitchen?&quot;
Mom asked sharply. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We can go into the 
living room if you'd rather,&quot; Fraser
replied 
blandly.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But is this necessary? I'm sure the police 
took a statement
from her already.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They did, but 
your daughter was not very forthcoming. I
thought she might feel more 
comfortable in more familiar surroundings.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Actually 
the reason I hadn't told the police much was because
whenever I 
started to talk about what I saw I could hear that
incomprehensible 
mad voice from the park in my head. I didn't
want to talk about the 
park, because if I did I knew I'd let all
that insanity and evil into 
my house, and then I'd never be free
of it.<BR>
<BR>
Fraser could 
sense my reluctance. &quot;It's ok Daria, you can
tell me. You'll 
feel better if you let it out,&quot; He said trying
to coax me into 
talking.<BR>
<BR>
I sighed, &quot;Where would you like me to 
start?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The beginning is fine, of your day at 
least, that's germane
to the topic.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I smirked, 
&quot;You're trying to make me feel at ease aren't
you?&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;If I hadn't qualified my statement you would have 
described
the Big Bang. It's a great way to avoid my question.&quot; 
Again
he was probably right, but I wasn't going to say so.<BR>
<BR>
I 
sighed, &quot;My friend Jane and I went down to the park. We
split 
up, I went off to try and find a quiet place to read and
found the 
body. I called the police and that's that.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What 
did you see in the clearing Daria?&quot; Fraser asked
gently. 
<BR>
<BR>
I closed my eyes to gather myself. I could see that ruined 
face
in my mind's eye. I wanted to run screaming from the room, 
but
that would've been a quick route to a real padded room. I 
opened
my eyes. &quot;He was naked,&quot; I said finally. &quot;His 
body
was all slashed, there were long strips of flesh removed. He 
had
a big hole in his chest...&quot; I trailed 
off.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And?&quot; Fraser asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You know 
what I'm going to say.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I think I do, but I still 
need you to say it. Don't worry,
we're all adults 
here.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Okay,&quot; I looked between my parents 
nervously, &quot;Half
the boy's face was cut off and lying next to 
the body.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Gah! Mmmph, excuse me,&quot; Dad said 
quickly before running
out of the kitchen.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;How was the 
body positioned?&quot; Fraser asked evenly.
<BR>
<BR>
I shrugged, 
&quot;He was just lying there.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Did anything 
catch your eye?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You mean aside from the mangled 
corpse?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Of course.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I shook my 
head, &quot;No, nothing really, of course I was pretty
focused on the 
body.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And you didn't touch 
anything?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ok, that's 
all I need to hear.&quot; He turned off the tape
recorder. 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Now what?&quot; Mom asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Now I try 
to catch the crazy son of a bitch. Look Mrs. Morgendorffer,
Daria, 
there's something I have to tell you.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;What's 
that?&quot; Mom asked guardedly.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There's a small, very 
small, extremely thin chance that
the killer might also be targeting 
the people who find the bodies.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What?&quot; Mom 
shouted, &quot;You mean that monster is
going to try and kill my 
daughter?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No, there's a chance the killer might 
try, but we're not
really sure.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;How can you not 
be sure?&quot; I asked, after finally getting
my brain to 
restart.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;First of all let me say that not all of the 
people who have
found victims of the killer have died. And of those 
that did die
their deaths all can easily be attributed to other, much 
less
malicious, causes.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm not saying this well, 
excuse me. Out of the now seven
people who have found a body, three 
are dead. One died of a heart
attack, another was involved in a car 
accident, and the third
was a cop who was shot in a robbery 
attempt.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So what's the problem? Those are all 
very explainable, if
sort of strange.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The catch 
is that every person who has found a corpse in
this case has gotten 
at least one threatening letter or phone
call and we think the killer 
is the one responsible.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well what are you going 
to do about it?&quot; Mom demanded.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We're going to 
catch the bastard Mrs. Morgendorffer. We're
also going to do our best 
to keep your names out of the papers.
I've already told the local 
police I'll personally destroy anyone
who talks to the press. We've 
got the 911 tape in our possession
and no one else knows what your 
found. And if it comes down to
it, I can keep your daughter safe Mrs. 
Morgendorffer. Before I
joined the FBI I was an officer in Special 
Forces, Green Berets,
Delta Force, that sort of thing. And if it 
makes you feel any
better, if we can get through this month without 
any unpleasantness
you're safe.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why, what 
happens in a month?&quot; Mom asked. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Somebody else is 
going to die, right Agent Fraser?&quot;
I asked. <BR>
<BR>
He nodded, 
&quot;That's about it.&quot; Fraser looked at his watch.
&quot;I've 
got a conference call to make. It was nice meeting
you Mrs. 
Morgendorffer, I hope your husband feels 
better.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I just wish we could have met under more 
favorable circumstances,&quot;
Mom said, 
sighing.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Daria, I'm sure we'll talk more later. Don't 
worry about
any of this. There are already a couple of agents around 
the house
to keep an eye on you. We'll make sure you stay safe, even 
if
this guy tries anything, and just think of all the money 
we're
spending on you.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Great, my tax dollars in 
action&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh, Mrs. Morgendorffer, one more thing. 
Would it be ok with
you if we put a wiretap on your home 
phone.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;A wiretap? What on earth 
for?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Just in case the killer calls here. I'd 
like to have it
recorded. We'dbe very discreet and destroy anything 
that wasn't
in the scope of the case.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I suppose 
so, but only if you turn over any tape that doesn't
involve your case 
so I can destroy them, and if you produce a
signed affidavit that you 
did not make any copies of the private
conversations that you 
record.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Fraser shrugged, &quot;Fine by me. A tech team 
will install the
tap tonight, you won't even know it's 
there.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Wonderful,&quot; Mom muttered. Agent 
Fraser stood up and
left the room, leaving Mom and I sitting at the 
table.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Uhm, I'm sorry I got you involved in this mess 
Mom,&quot;
I said after a long period of 
silence.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Daria, there's nothing to apologize about. 
You didn't intend
to find that poor boy. None of this is your 
fault.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah, I guess 
so.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Is there anything you need 
sweetie?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Uhm, just some time to myself right 
now?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ok, I'll be around if you need me for 
anything.&quot; Predictably
her cell phone rang. Mom looked at it 
hesitantly. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Go ahead, answer it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Mom 
mouthed a thank you as she raised the phone to her ear. 
&quot;Hello
Helen Morgendorffer. Oh hello Eric...&quot; Mom stood up 
and walked
off, all the while verbally kissing her boss's 
ass.<BR>
<BR>
I sighed and walked into the living room. The TV looked 
incredibly
inviting at that moment. The thought of watching brain 
numbing
crap was an attractive one. I sat down on the couch and 
began
flipping aimlessly through the channels. Eventually I 
settled
on one of those schlocky music video channels. Normally I'd 
never
even consider sitting through the inane strutting of 
teeny-bopper
crap music, but right now it was proof that at least 
some people
weren't worrying about serial killers, and I needed that 
comfort
right then. Quinn came home at some point during my vigil in 
front
of the idiot box. Mom dragged her off before she could say 
anything
to me. When I saw Quinn she furtively slipped upstairs, 
assiduously
trying to avoid me.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;How typically 
Quinn,&quot; I thought. &quot;Then again how
would I have reacted if 
Mom told me that Quinn has just found
a dead body?&quot; Several 
answers came to mind, none of them
made me feel particularly proud. 
<BR>
<BR>
The phone rang, I ignored it, chances were good it wasn't 
for
me, and I didn't feel up to talking to any of Quinn's 
associates.
The phone stopped ringing, I moved on to a sports 
channel. It
was almost soothing to watch those painfully too hip 
sports anchors
glorifying a bunch of immature, overpaid 
assholes.<BR>
<BR>
Quinn crept into my field of view, holding the 
phone. &quot;Uh,
Daria, Jane's on the phone, she wants to talk to 
you.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I stared at the phone for a long moment before 
taking it from
Quinn's hand. She then bolted out of the room like a 
deer on the
first day of hunting season. &quot;Hey 
Jane.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hey Daria, how are you 
doing?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ok when you consider that I found the 
latest victim of a
deranged sociopath who now might be trying to kill 
me.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Whoa, who told you 
that?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The FBI agent who just left my house after 
delivering the
good news.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't even know how 
to respond to that. How close to death
are you?&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The FBI doesn't know, but apparently in a month we'll 
know
for sure.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;What happens in a 
month?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Somebody else 
dies.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh.&quot; An almost painful silence fell 
over us. &quot;I'm
sorry I dragged you down to the park today. If I 
had known this
was going to happen...&quot; Jane trailed 
off.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Don't blame yourself for this Jane, nobody 
could've known
today would be the day I found a corpse. Don't make me 
give you
the same pep talk my mother just gave 
me.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What did you apologize 
for?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The FBI is placing on our phones.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Wow, so this conversation is being recorded?&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Possibly, we weren't told when they'd start the 
tap.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Whoa, I guess you'd better watch yourself 
next time you
and Tom talk on the phone.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I 
really doubt the FBI cares. Besides they're going to have
to listen 
to all of Quinn's phone calls.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ouch I feel sorry 
for whoever gets that job. So, what was
the FBI agent 
like?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;He talked a lot and tried to get to know 
me.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;How 
disappointing.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Look Jane, I'm really out of it 
right now. Can I call you
back tomorrow?&quot; I didn't want to deal 
with Jane's questions
about the FBI at that point.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Uh 
sure, talk to you tomorrow Daria.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I murmured a goodbye 
and hung up the phone. I went back to staring
at the TV when I 
realized what I needed was human contact. &quot;Well,&quot;
I 
thought,. &quot;There's no one here who fits that bill, and
I just 
blew Jane off. I guess that leaves Tom.&quot; I picked
up the phone 
and dialed the Sloanes's number.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hello, Sloane 
residence,&quot; Tom answered. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Tom, it's Daria, I 
need you to come over to my house now.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Daria? 
Do you know what time it is?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Not really, can you 
just come ever here, please?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Is something 
wrong?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'd rather talk about it in 
person.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Uh sure, I'll be right 
over.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Tom hung up the phone and I leaned back on the 
couch. To pass
the time I forced myself to think about a paper that 
Mr. DeMartino
had assigned us the past week. So what if a homicidal 
maniac was
trying to kill me, I still had school to deal with. And if 
I had
a choice I'd take the madman any day. I didn't get a SWAT 
team
to protect from school after all. I continued that train of 
thought
until I heard a gentle knock on the door. I got up and 
answered
it. Tom was standing there with a concerned look on his 
face.
Part of me was glad he had rushed over to see me. The other 
part
was glad he wasn't holding a knife. In all honesty I didn't 
know
what I felt towards Tom, but at that moment he was a sight 
for
sore eyes.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hey Daria, what was so urgent?&quot; 
Tom asked, concerned.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Come on in, I don't want to 
make a scene in front of the
FBI.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The FBI, 
huh?&quot; Tom asked as I pulled him into the house.
<BR>
<BR>
After 
I closed the door I turned and faced Tom. &quot;This morning
Jane and 
I went down to the park. I found the remains of a victim
of a serial 
killer. Now the FBI is putting a wiretap on the phone
and maintaining 
twenty-four hour surveillance just in case the
killer comes after 
me.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Holy shit, Daria, are you 
alright?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh I'm just 
peachy.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So, what do you need me to 
do?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Just be around I 
guess.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Need a little human contact to remind you 
you're alive?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Something like 
that.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And you probably don't want to talk about 
it.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I've trained you 
well.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So what do you want to 
do?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I shrugged, &quot;Watch 
TV?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sounds good to me,&quot; he replied. We sat 
down on the
couch. Tom wrapped an arm around me. I must admit, it did 
feel
nice. Tom turned on the TV; Sportscenter blared at us. 
&quot;You
were watching ESPN?&quot; He asked. &quot;Wow, you must 
really
be depressed.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It could have been worse. I 
could have been watching Fashion
Vision.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Tom 
shuddered, &quot;You're right, still have you ever willingly
watched 
ESPN?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well no.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So what's 
the deal, and don't say a sudden interest in who
won the Dubai 
Classic.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I sighed, &quot;Because I didn't want to 
think since the only
thing I'd think about is that damn 
corpse.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Was it really that 
bad?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Tom, he was mutilated by a madman, what do 
you think?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Did you know the 
person?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No, yes, kind of.&quot; I took a deep 
breath, &quot;He was
in my class, but I don't remember what his name 
is. He didn't
mean anything to me, just another face, but now he's 
dead and
doesn't have a face, literally.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And 
you're upset with yourself because you think it should
have a deeper 
impact on you?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No, I'm upset because I am upset 
at his death!&quot; I snapped.
&quot;We have this kid who probably 
had some sort of hope, or
dream, and now he's just a body on a slab, 
a piece of evidence,
another part in some puzzle for the FBI to 
solve. The only thing
about his life that is going to mean a damn is 
how he died...&quot;
I paused, &quot;And he didn't die well. I found 
him naked, and
slashed to 
hell.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ouch.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And since then 
it's almost like I've got this bond with
him. I saw him at a moment 
of extreme vulnerability, he's naked,
dead, and ripped to shreds. I 
know him better than the people
now trying to find who killed 
him.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And the two of you have the same person 
after you.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
I frowned, &quot;Yes, there's that too, 
thank you for reminding
me.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
He smiled, &quot;Anytime. 
Look Daria, I won't pretend to know
what to say, but I am here to 
help out anyway I can.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I know you're here 
aren't you. Now can we please not talk
about it?&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That I can do easily,&quot; Tom replied as he leaned 
over
to kiss me. We sat there for a long time, neither of us 
really
watching the TV, but not speaking to each other either. I 
suppose
the events of the day had worn me down because I drifted to 
sleep
right there. Tom gently nudged me back awake. &quot;Hey 
Daria,
let's get you in bed.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I thought about my room, 
and then about that voice that kept running
through my head, &quot;I 
don't want to go up there. I don't think
I can handle it right 
now.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Uh, ok, do you want me to get you a blanket 
or something?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What I'd like is for you to stay 
right there,&quot; I said
as I leaned against him. I didn't like the 
fact that I was craving
human contact this much, but it did make me 
feel a little better.
And at that point anything that made me feel 
better was desperately
needed. As I sat there lying against Tom, 
listening to him fall
asleep I wondered if my sleep would be dream 
free.<BR>
<BR>
&lt; Sunday, Somewhere, 1:00 
AM&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Enshrouded in the darkness of his room the man put 
the videotape
he had made into the VCR. He had slept through the 
discovery of
the body, much to his regret. The camera had caught it 
all and
the man rubbed his hands together in anticipation, he had 
even
made popcorn. The tape started up, he grabbed the remote and 
fast-forwarded
through the empty segment of the tape, pausing to 
admire his most
recent masterpiece every once in a while. He stopped 
when he saw
motion. He backed the tape to just before the green blur 
appeared
on the screen. The image settled down and shortly a black 
and
green clad figure appeared. He watched in fascination as the 
girl
stared at his handiwork. She didn't scream, or say anything. 
She
just stood there until finally running away. He rewound the 
tape
and watched the scene several times. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Maybe she 
understands,&quot; he thought to himself as he
watched the blank 
expression on the girl's face. &quot;She might
be the one.&quot; He 
froze the frame on a shot of her staring
directly at the camera. 
&quot;I need to know your name little
girl, then we can have a nice 
talk.&quot; She looked like she
was in high school. &quot;I guess 
I'll have to pay Lawndale High
another visit.&quot; He chuckled; 
sometimes the job was so easy.
<BR>
<BR>
&lt;Lawndale Coroner's 
Office, 2:00 AM&gt;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hey Steve, wake up,&quot; Sarah 
said as she prodded me.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm up, I'm up,&quot; I 
replied as I sat up on the gurney
I'd been napping on. When I opened 
my eyes all I saw was white.
I had fallen asleep on agurney outside 
of the morgue. Sarah must
have wheeled me into the lab and draped a 
sheet over me while
I was asleep. She has an odd sense of humor. 
&quot;Got something
for me?&quot; I asked. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Lab 
results are back from the autopsy. Lots of people are
getting 
overtime on this one.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And if we catch the guy 
it's earned. So what's the score?&quot;
I got up and we walked over 
to the body, now resting in an autopsy
bay. <BR>
<BR>
She picked up a 
clipboard and began reading, &quot;Our victim's
name is Brian 
Wiltson, age seventeen. He was a student at Lawndale
High School, a 
member of the football team, a decent GPA, but
nothing to shout 
about. Preliminary background checks don't show
anything other than 
your typical teenage.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I nodded, &quot;We'll get to 
work on the victim Monday at the
school, how did he 
die?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Sarah walked over to the body. &quot;Like I said 
at the scene,
death was a result of massive blood loss from multiple 
stab wounds
to the head and torso. The flesh from the right side of 
the face
was peeled off and left beside the 
body.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Nice job sewing it back on,&quot; I 
commented. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Thanks, I thought the family would 
appreciate it. I used
fishing line instead of normal sutures and then 
covered the whole
thing with that liquid 
skin...&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's more than I needed to know. What 
else did you find?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;In addition to the face the 
other major mutilation is the
hole punched into the chest cavity. The 
internal organs were left
in place. Though a little 
mashed.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;How did he do it, and was the injury pre 
or post mortem?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;A heavy piece of metal. The 
wound pattern here suggests
a solid piece of metal with a star shaped 
design. I picked a few
metal slivers off some ribs so we can look for 
scratch marks if
we find the weapon. There's no really definitive way 
to say when
the blow was delivered, but my guess is that it came 
after the
victim had bled out.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;What makes you 
say that?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There's not enough blood in the chest 
cavity. If I smashed
your heart you'd expect a lot of blood to pool, 
that wasn't present
here.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;So there was no one 
killing blow?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Nope, just like the rest, death 
was a result of multiple
wounds. A couple arteries were nicked, but I 
don't think that
was by design.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I nodded, &quot;All 
consistent with the previous killings. Anything
of interest in the 
blood work?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Other than the normal cocktail of 
goodies you'll find in
a teenager there were traces of 
ketamine.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ketamine, horse 
tranquilizers?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's one of its uses, yes. It's 
also used in hospitals
and by people looking for a different kind of 
high.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This is new isn't it?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Sarah 
nodded, &quot;Yeah, it is. Which means the kid might have
taken some 
to get high.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You wouldn't have brought it up if 
you thought that.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There's too much in his 
system. He was given the ketamine
a couple of hours before being 
killed. My guess is the ketamine
was used to subdue the victim 
without making a scene.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Have we put together the 
victim's day yet?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Local PD got a brief outline 
when they talked to the parents.
He went to school and never came 
home.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ok, we'll add ketamine use to the 
questionnaire when we
interview the students.&quot; I saw Sarah waver 
on her feet slightly.
&quot;Have you gotten any rest 
today?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm fine.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No, you're 
not. Come on, let's get you back to the motel,
this can wait until 
tomorrow.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What are we doing tomorrow?&quot; She 
asked, not bothering
to suppress her yawn.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Video 
conference with the profilers for starters. We have
to get ready for 
Monday, and we've got to talk to the 
family.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Great, I hate this fucking job,&quot; 
Sarah groused as she
removed her scrubs.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You're not 
going to hear any disagreements from me, but
we do good work, and it 
means something.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
She sighed, &quot;Yeah, I 
know.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I put an arm around her shoulder, &quot;Come on, 
let's get you
that shower and a good,&quot; I looked at my watch, 
&quot;five
hours of sleep.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Wonderful,&quot; 
Sarah groaned as we walked out of the Coroner's
Office. 
<BR>
<BR>
&lt;Sunday, Morgendorffer Residence 12pm&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I was 
sitting in my room trying to work on my homework when I
heard a tap 
on my door. &quot;Come in,&quot; I said. The door
opened and Quinn 
walked in. &quot;Hello Quinn, what do you 
want?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I want to talk to you 
Daria.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;About?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What do you 
think about? The fact that you found Brian 
Wiltson's
body.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So, his name was Brian 
Wiltson,&quot; I murmured to myself.
&quot;Did you know him?&quot; I 
asked Quinn.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah, he'd taken me out a couple of 
times. He was going
to take me out again this Wednesday...I guess I 
need to find a
new date,&quot; She said sadly.<BR>
<BR>
On the 
surface this wasn't a particularly surprising statement;
Quinn had 
probably gone out with every eligible male in Lawndale,
but there was 
something about the way she had said it. &quot;Wait
a minute, he'd 
taken you out more than once?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah, he's...was a 
really nice guy.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You liked him didn't 
you.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No more than any other guy who takes me 
out, but he was
really nice, and kind of sweet, so I might've like 
him, but I
don't know.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;And you want to talk to 
me about this because I'm the soul
with the keen insight on 
death?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Quinn frowned, &quot;No I want to talk to you 
because who else
am I going to talk to about this, Tiffany, 
Mom?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;A point well taken, speak your 
piece.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well this whole thing is like so bizarre. 
I mean I saw Brian
alive Friday night, and then last night Mom says 
you found a dead
body, and then in today's paper the front page is 
all full of
stuff about Brian being found mangled in the park. So I 
figured
you must have been the person who found 
Brian.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Good guess.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But the 
really strange thing is that the paper said the
guy who killed Brian 
likes to kill gay people. And that's so weird
because I know Brian 
wasn't gay. At least I'm pretty sure. I mean
he seemed to be 
interested in me as more than a friend. But what
if it was all an act 
to try and hide the fact that he was gay.
Then he'd be lying to me, 
not to mention using me to try and look
normal. Not that there's 
anything wrong with being gay. But then
again if was hiding his 
sexual preference what other skeletons
were in his closet?&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
My brain started twist itself into a pretzel by this time 
trying
to follow Quinn's monologue, &quot;Quinn,&quot; I said in 
desperation.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;...if you're gay you should just say so. 
I don't care, just
let me know so I don't have to worry about going 
out with you...&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Quinn!&quot; I tried 
again.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sure, some people aren't as tolerant as I am, 
but at least
let me know, I can keep a secret. I haven't told anyone 
about
Stacy's bedwetting issues....&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Would you 
shut your damn mouth and listen to me!&quot; I
shouted. Quinn stopped 
at stared at me. &quot;Listen to me very
carefully, Brian wasn't 
gay.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh, says who?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Says the 
FBI agent who was here yesterday. None of the other
people killed 
were gay so there's no reason to think that Brian
was either.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Then why did the paper say that he was?&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Because of a letter left at one of the earlier crime 
scenes
could have been interpreted that way. The killer is really 
just
going after people who have a certain 
look.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What's that?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Good 
looking.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah, Brian certainly was that,&quot; 
Quinn said wistfully.
&quot;And hey, at least you don't have to worry 
about Tom.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
I frowned, &quot;Hey, watch it 
there.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm just making a factual statement, I 
know tons guys cuter
than Tom.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Quinn the 
conversation can end at any moment, with you on
the ground.&quot; I 
must admit, I was impressed, Quinn got in
a pretty good shot, she 
must have been practicing.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'll be good,&quot; she 
said contritely.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Is there anything else you wanted to 
say, or did you just
want to voice your concerns about Brian's sexual 
preference.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well, I did have one other question 
for you.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;And that is?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What 
was it like finding him there?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What do you 
mean?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I mean seeing there, on the ground, dead. 
Was it, like,
all creepy or what?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I shrugged, 
&quot;He was dead, there wasn't much more to it than
that.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh come on Daria, there has to be more.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Look Quinn, I didn't even know who it was I found 
until
you told me just now. Brian didn't really mean anything to 
me
when he was alive and now, beyond the initial shock of finding
a 
flayed corpse, and the sense of sorrow whenever a person dies,
I 
don't have strong feelings for him. He's dead, that's sad, he
was 
brutally murdered, that's tragic, but that's it.&quot; Actually
that 
wasn't just it, but I wasn't going to admit that to Quinn.
In fact 
Brian's ruined face had haunted my dreams the previous
night. In the 
dream I saw Brain's head floating in front of me.
His mouth was 
moving and it seemed like he was trying to tell
me something, but I 
couldn't figure out what because that damn
voice was shouting over 
him. I was convinced the voice was the
sound of madness and I was 
slowly going around the bend, but I
wasn't going to tell that to my 
sister. Or anyone else for that
matter, the longer I could put off 
the real padded cell the better.
I took a deep breath and continued, 
&quot;Look Quinn I feel bad
for you. You obviously cared about Brian 
and now you have to deal
with his death.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;What 
about you?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I just have to live in fear for a 
month, then I'll be 
good.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Haven't you 
heard, I'm the next target.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;But you're 
not...&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Pretty?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;A 
guy.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No I'm not, but the FBI agent said the 
killer might try
to get me.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;But, you can't die 
now, not when you're, like, almost normal.
I've been planning your 
prom dress for months!&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;You've been doing 
what?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Designing your prom dress. You and Tom 
were going to go
to at least one of your proms, 
right?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Quinn you had better leave or else I'll 
be forced to hurt
you quite badly.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Alright, 
sheesh, do your sister a favor and this is the
thanks you get.&quot; 
Quinn reached over and hugged me, &quot;Don't
go and die on me Daria, 
ok?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'll try not to,&quot; I replied as I 
scraped Quinn off
of me. She started to leave the room. &quot;Hey 
Quinn,&quot; I
called out. 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm really sorry about 
Brian, it was a pretty shitty way
to die.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Quinn 
sniffed for a moment, &quot;Yeah, he was a really nice guy,
he didn't 
deserve that.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Nobody does Quinn.&quot; She 
walked out of the room, leaving
me to my 
thoughts.<BR>
<BR>
&lt;Monday, LHS 7:00am&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I sat in the 
office of the principal of the local high school,
one Angela Li. She 
looked like your typical tinpot dictator type
and was defending her 
kingdom vigorously.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Now, Agent Fraser, I'm sure you 
can understand my position,
what you're asking would disrupt my 
students' school day at a
time when any additional distractions would 
be most harmful.&quot;
Li told me, I let my eyes roam the office while she talked, taking
note of the statue of Buddha and the books she 
lved behind her.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;First of all, the name's 
Frazer,&quot; I said, doing my
best to keep my anger in check, 
&quot;Secondly, I do appreciate
what a shock this whole affair must 
be to you and your students,
but I'm operating on a very tight 
schedule here and I have to
interview your students today, and if I 
have to I'll call a judge
and get a warrant.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Now there's no need for that, we're both rational 
adults
interested in keeping order,&quot; Li 
spluttered.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's where you're wrong, I'm interested 
in justice. You're
going to give my interview team unfettered access 
to this school,
quiet places to conduct our interviews, and we're 
going to be
pulling students out of classes to interview them, I'm 
also going
to have chats with all the faculty and staff. That's what 
we're
doing and if you have any objections to that I'm getting a 
warrant.
Something I'll be sure to mention to the national press 
quite
loudly on the courthouse steps. Which will raise the 
question,
'Just what is she hiding?' and it'd be a shame if I had to 
do
that.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Uhm, yes, well, Lawndale High has 
nothing to hide and would
be happy to assist the FBI in anyway.&quot; 
I raised an eyebrow
at the way she said Lawndale High with such 
reverence.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm sure,&quot; I muttered as I stood up. 
&quot;Thank you
for your cooperation Ms. Li, my agents will be out of 
your hair
as quickly as possible.&quot; I left the principal fuming 
in her
office and walked out to the parking lot. Sarah and the rest 
of
the team were lounging around a Bureau 
Suburban.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Are we good to go?&quot; Sarah 
asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yep, though not exactly with the blessing of 
the school's
administration.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What did you do 
this time Steve?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Nothing, the principal's a 
bitch, I had to threaten to get
a warrant to get us in there. So keep 
your eyes peeled people,
there's something going on in 
there.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Think the principal is involved in the 
killings?&quot; One
Agent Grisman asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No, probably 
not, but I'd like to know anyway, just for
our edification. Ok guys 
and gals listen up. I want to get through
as many students as 
possible today. You all have the questionnaires.
If they say they 
didn't know the victim and didn't know anything
about the victim cut 
them loose and move onto the next. I know
I don't have to remind 
anyone, but I will anyway, write down everything
about each 
interview, even the duds. By the end of the day I want
to know Brian 
Wiltson better than his mother did. Ok, let's get
to it.&quot; We 
entered the school just as the first school busses
started to arrive. 
<BR>
<BR>
&lt;Monday, Lawndale High, 10:00am&gt;<BR>
<BR>
The first 
day of school that week went about as badly as I feared.
The halls 
were filled with mock grief and people wearing black
armbands. To 
make things worse a legion of reporters were camped
out on the front 
lawn of the school, and everywhere you looked
in the school, police 
and adults in dark suits were milling about.
Notices were posted all 
over the school reminding me of the &quot;Mandatory
Memorial 
Service,&quot; being held the next day in the 
gym.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Such love for a guy nobody knew,&quot; Jane said. 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's just two parts guilt over not getting to know 
the guy
while he was alive, and one part playing to the cameras 
outside.&quot;
I replied darkly. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;When do you expect 
you'll have to hang out your shingle?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hopefully 
never, the PTA passed the hat and brought in some
grief counselors to 
help us through this terrible time.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Are you 
going to take advantage of their 
services?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why?&quot; I asked 
blandly.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well because you certainly have more 
attachment to this
whole mess than most of our 
classmates.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Pardon me if I don't trust anyone 
hired by Ms. Li,&quot;
I replied as we walked into O'Neill's 
class.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You certainly do have a knack for the 
well-timed remark,&quot;
Jane commented as we stared at the 
classroom. A rainbow's funeral
was the only way to describe it. 
O'Neill had covered the room
with rainbows that had black ribbons 
wrapped around them. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ah good, Daria and Jane, here 
are your arm bands,&quot;
O'Neill said as he handed us a pair of 
black armbands.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And just why should I wear 
this?&quot; I asked as I took
the piece of cloth.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why, 
to show your support of your fallen classmate; tragically
struck down 
simply because he was different from the societal
norm.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Come again?&quot; Jane asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Brian 
Wiltson, the boy killed this weekend, had been hiding
his 
homosexuality from us, and he was killed because of his 
sexual
orientation. Now maybe if we had all been a little more 
understanding
of Brian and everyone like him this senseless tragedy 
might have
been avoided. So the black armbands show our commitment to 
the
cause of equal rights for all gay 
people.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm sorry I asked,&quot; Jane muttered 
as we took our seats.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm sorry you asked too,&quot; 
I replied.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well, aren't you going to do something 
about it?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I sighed and raised my hand. &quot;Mr. 
O'Neill I have a question.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yes 
Daria?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;How do you know that Brian was 
gay?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Did 
Brian ever do anything to suggest that he was actually
gay?&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Now Daria, gay people don't look any different from 
you
or I. There's no way to tell who is or isn't gay simply by 
looking
at him or her.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Then did he ever say 
anything remotely similar to a declaration
of 
homosexuality?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well, no, not that I know of, but 
then again, many gays
are deeply confused in their teens and try to 
hide their gayness
from the world.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;So in other 
words, you're basing your assumption on the
fact that the media says 
the person who killed Brian only kills
gays.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What's your problem with the fact that Brian was a 
homosexual?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What bothers me is that it's not a 
fact, and it seems to
me that you're misrepresenting the victim of a 
horrible crime
by saying he was.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Daria, do you 
have a problem with gay people?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;No, and that's 
not the point,&quot; I snapped. <BR>
<BR>
Before O'Neill could reply 
the door opened and Agent Fraser walked
into the room, &quot;Hello, 
sorry to interrupt but I'm looking
for a Daria Morgendorffer, is she 
in the class?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I quickly raised my hand, &quot;I'm 
Daria.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ms. Morgendorffer, would you come with me 
please, I'd like
to ask you a few questions.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I hastily 
gathered up my pack and walked to the door. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Uh Daria, 
don't forget your armband,&quot; O'Neill said,
tapping his arm. I 
sighed, pulled the stupid thing onto my arm
and followed Fraser out 
of the room.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Thank-you so much,&quot; I told 
Fraser.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You're the first person to tell me that 
today,&quot; he
replied lightly. &quot;What was the deal back there 
anyway?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I shook my head, &quot;That was Mr. O'Neill 
latching onto another
cause, regardless of how applicable to the 
situation it is. The
only good news is that in a week he'll have his 
sights set on
some new crusade. I just wish he could have stopped at 
wall decorations
and left the armbands at 
home.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Just so you know, there's a couple of guys 
outside selling
those armbands for fifteen bucks a pop, and the 
President of the
Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Alliance is already 
singling out Lawndale
as an exemplary instance of a school uniting 
behind the cause
of gay rights.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;So what you're 
telling me is that people are using Brian's
death to further their 
own financial and political agendas.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well 
obviously,&quot; Fraser said as he opened the door
of an empty 
classroom.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's so obnoxious, he's a martyr for a 
cause he probably
never considered in his entire 
life.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That it is,&quot; Fraser agreed as he 
offered me a chair.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Can't you do anything to put a 
stop to it?&quot; I asked.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Later today we're giving a 
press conference. All the networks
and CNN will be there. One of the 
questions going to be asked
will be about Brian's sexual orientation. 
I'll say, once again,
that there's no evidence that any of the 
victims were gay, and
that as far as the Bureau is concerned the 
killings are not motivated
by homophobic tendencies.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Nice speech.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Thanks we've got 
some good writers in the PR department.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But it 
won't make a difference will it?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Not in the 
slightest.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Damn, I was afraid of that.&quot; I 
sighed, &quot;So, what
do you want to hear from 
me?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I just wanted to talk to you, see how you're 
taking things.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Uh, are you sure it's safe to 
talk in here? The rumor is
that Ms. Li's bugged all the 
classrooms.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Fraser chuckled, &quot;Don't worry, I've 
taken care of that. I
picked up on the surveillance gear right off. 
You've got a very
paranoid principal.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Tell me 
about it. Is there anything you can do about 
her?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Fraser shook his head, &quot;Sorry, this was the 
result of an
illegal search, wouldn't hold up in court. Besides, I 
have bigger
fish to fry, and you're one of those 
fish.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I sighed, &quot;And what do you want from 
me?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Like I said, I just want to know how you're 
doing.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm fine, can I go?&quot; I 
snapped.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sure, if you want to go back to class.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Alright, we can talk.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;How have 
you been sleeping?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Fine I 
guess.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No nightmares? And it's ok if there are, 
it's perfectly
normal and I wouldn't think any less of 
you.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well, I have had one, several times 
now.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Tell me about it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I took a 
deep breath, &quot;I see Brian's face, like it was when
I found him, 
and it's like he's trying to tell me something, but
there's this 
voice drowning him out.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What's the voice 
saying?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't know, I've never been able to 
figure that out.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Fraser quirked an eyebrow, &quot;How 
often have you heard this
voice anyway?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Uh, 
just in the dream,&quot; I answered quickly. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Daria, I 
can tell when someone is bullshitting me. How often
have you heard 
this voice?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why the hell do you care 
anyway?&quot; I thought you were
trying to catch a murderer, not 
psycho-analyze my dreams.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I have a small army 
of federal agents and local police tracking
down the killer, I can 
spare a few moments to make sure you're
going to be ok.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
I sighed, &quot;If you must know I've heard the this voice 
whenever
I think about what I saw in that 
clearing.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Fraser nodded, &quot;That's understandable. 
Let me tell you a
little secret. I never looked at Brian's body at 
the crime scene.
In fact I haven't looked at any of the victims, 
other than photos.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why not?&quot; I 
asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Because I'd probably throw up. Same reason I 
never watch
autopsies, I can't stand the sight, and I'm a trained 
professional.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And how is this supposed to make 
me feel better?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;So you're hearing a voice, big 
deal, you're just trying
to cope with seeing something 
horrific.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But I was could feel the madness, it 
felt like it was creeping
up my spine and trying to throttle my 
brain. It was like the killer
was trying to talk to 
me.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;He was,&quot; Fraser said 
quietly.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Like I toldyou 
Saturday night, the killer is trying to
send a message with these 
murders, every facet of the victim and
the crime scene is one part of 
a larger picture. What I have to
do is figure out just what that 
picture means. Now I'm not a trained
professional, but I'd have to 
say that your problem stems from
some kind of inability to deal with 
what you saw.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What do you mean? I saw Brian 
Wiltson's mangled corpse.
I can accept that 
fact.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But you've got this interference between 
you and your memories
of what you saw.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So what 
am I supposed to do?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I can't answer that, I only 
know enough psychology to be
dangerous, I'd recommend you go see a 
therapist and just talk,
like we're doing now. That's the only way to 
put this behind you,
deal with it now, otherwise...&quot; he trailed 
off.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Otherwise what?&quot; I 
demanded.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That voice might start to make sense,&quot; 
he said simply.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I, uh, don't know how much of a help 
this will be, but my
sister Quinn saw Brian the night he died,&quot; 
I said, trying
to change the topic. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;She did? When and 
where?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;She was a little vague about that 
part.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Fraser jotted something down on a notebook. 
&quot;I'll talk to
her as soon as the two of us are 
done.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Have these interviews been useful at 
all?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Fraser shrugged, &quot;It's investigatorial busy 
work, but we
might get lucky and find out something. Like the 
information your
sister might have.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Do you 
think you'll catch this guy now, before anyone else
dies?&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I always think that, you can't think otherwise.&quot; 
He
closed his notebook. &quot;So, are you going to be 
ok?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Between you, my boyfriend, and my friend 
Jane, I just might
be. Assuming I don't snap and punch out Mr. 
O'Neill.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Fraser chuckled, &quot;Don't worry about 
him, or the rest of them
Daria, they're just trying to find an 
explanation for why this
happened.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I 
guess,&quot; I said grudgingly, &quot;Still, it seems
wrong.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
Fraser clapped me on the shoulder, &quot;You know the truth 
at
least, so do other people I'm sure. Just do your best to 
keep
Brian's memory intact with you and things will work 
themselves
out.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;One can always hope so,&quot; I 
said before walking out
of the room and heading back to 
class.<BR>
<BR>
&lt;Monday, Office of Principal Angela Li, 
3:30pm&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I stretched and tried to work the kinks out of my 
back. It hadn't
been easy but we'd managed to interview the majority 
of the students
at Lawndale High. All that stood between me and a 
long night of
reading was a courtesy call to the principal. As I 
rounded the
corner next to the office the door to the office started 
to open.
I ducked back around the corner and watched as a man in blue 
coveralls
walked out. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I still say this is highly 
irregular, and I hope you don't
expect to get paid anything extra for 
this little 'service' of
yours.&quot; I heard Li say from the other 
side of the door. Needless
to say my interest was piqued and I 
examined the man a little
more closely. He was tall, between six 
three or six five, weight
around two hundred and twenty pounds. His 
hair was black. In every
conventional sense of the word he was a very 
attractive individual.
The name on his coveralls read 
&quot;Julian.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Look Ms. Li, like I said 
before,&quot; his voice was curt,
but not mean. &quot;This is free, I 
just want to look at the tapes
to make sure there aren't any focus 
issues with the cameras.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Tapes,&quot; I 
muttered, I felt a flicker of something in
the back of my head, 
&quot;Hmm, those might be worth checking
out. Better find out how new 
these cameras are.&quot; I had noticed
the camera's in the 
classrooms, but it hadn't occurred to me that
there might be archived 
tapes.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well, if it's free, ok fine. You still have 
your key to
the control room?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The man nodded, 
&quot;Yes, I do. I'll return your tapes within
the next couple of 
days and make any adjustments that need to
be made to the 
cameras.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But be quick about it, I don't like 
holes in my archives.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
I decided now was as good a 
time as any to make an entrance. &quot;Oh,
sorry Principal Li. I 
didn't know you were in the middle of something.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Li 
stared at me nervously, probably wondering just how much I
had heard. 
&quot;Why hello Agent Fraser, it's nothing pressing,
just one of 
those little repair issues that pop up in a 
school.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The man stared at me, &quot;Agent, huh, are 
you investigating
that murder from over the weekend?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I 
nodded, &quot;That I am.&quot; It never hurt to talk to people
about 
these cases, mostly to put them at ease and to try to reduce
the 
level of panic.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Have you learned anything 
new?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Of course I have my limits, &quot;Sorry, I can't 
discuss the details
of an ongoing 
investigation.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Is there anything you can tell 
me?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That the guy who's doing this is a sick fuck 
and that unless
you're a teenage male between the ages of sixteen and 
eighteen
you don't have a thing to worry 
about.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well that's a relief. If you'll excuse me 
I have to go do
my job. Good luck finding your man Agent 
Fraser.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Thanks, although when we catch him it 
won't be because of
luck, but a lot of hard 
work.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm sure,&quot; The repairman walked off. 
I noted the name
of the back of the coveralls, Scheps Video Services, 
just another
tidbit to think about.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Surveillance 
cameras?&quot; I asked Li.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why yes, we had new parking 
lot surveillance cameras installed
a few weeks ago. Mr. Riggins was 
just making sure they were 
working
properly.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'll need to see all those 
tapes for the past 
month.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;To check for 
anything unusual. I can get a subpoena for
them I might 
add.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Li sighed, &quot;It will take sometime to make 
the copies.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's ok, I can detail a couple of 
Agents to the job and
have some dubbing machines flown 
in&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That would be very kind of 
you.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;My goal is to make sure we both get through 
this difficult
time as smoothly as possible.&quot; Actually my job 
was to find
a killer at all costs, but right now playing nice seemed 
like
the better approach. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm sure,&quot; Li 
muttered. &quot;Now what was it you wanted?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I 
just wanted to let you know we're done interviewing 
your
students.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;So you'll be 
leaving?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why Ms. Li, if I didn't know any better 
I'd say you were
trying to hide something from me.&quot; I knew she 
was actually,
the amount of illegal surveillance gear in the school 
was astounding.
But this wasn't the time or the place to get into 
that.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No, not at all, it's just we're all trying to 
put this terrible
tragedy behind us and we can't do that with an army 
of FBI agents
reminding everyone of the fate of their classmate. I 
suppose I
can let you make copies of my master tapes, since the 
backups
are already in use, but it has to be done quickly, I don't 
like
being without my master tapes.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I nodded, she did 
have a point, &quot;I am sorry for that, I'm
just doing everything I 
can to make sure this is the last school
to have to go through this 
ordeal. I'll send a pair of agents
by later tonight for those tapes. 
Have a good afternoon Ms. Li.&quot;
I said with as much faux courtesy 
as I could muster. I turned
and walked away before Li could offer up 
a retort. I walked out
of the school and found Sarah waiting for me 
by the car. &quot;The
principal keeps an archive of all the 
surveillance cameras on
school grounds.&quot; I said bluntly, 
&quot;Get on the phone to
Quantico and have them send down a couple 
A/V technicians along
with whatever gear they need.&quot; She nodded 
and got out her
phone. &quot;If we're really lucky the killer is on 
one of those
tapes,&quot; I said, stating the obvious. &quot;One more 
thing,&quot;
I said suddenly. &quot;Check and see if any of the other 
schools
had security cameras set up and if they kept their 
tapes.&quot;
Sarah nodded as she spoke on the phone. As I steered the 
car out
of the parking lot I saw Daria talking to some guy next to 
an
incredibly rusty Jag. &quot;Must be her boyfriend,&quot; I 
mused,
&quot;Maybe she will be okay after all.&quot; I waved to 
Daria
as I drove 
past.<BR>
<BR>
----xxx----xxx----xxx----xxx----xxx----<BR>
<BR>
I saw 
Agent Fraser wave at me as he drove past. I returned 
the
greeting.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Who was that?&quot; Tom 
asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The FBI Agent who I talked to last night.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What's he doing 
here?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Interviewing students about 
Brian.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Who?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The kid who 
died.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ahh, did you talk to him 
today?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I nodded, 
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;About what?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I 
shrugged, &quot;Stuff.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;How 
illuminating.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Tom,&quot; I 
growled.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I know, I know, you don't want to talk about 
it.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;No, I do just...&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Not 
right now, yeah, I understand.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I frowned, &quot;Why is 
that?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why is what?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why do 
you have to always be so damn supportive and understanding?
You're 
here to meet me when school's over. You don't get pissed
off when I 
don't talk to you about my day.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What would you 
have me do?&quot; Tom asked in a reasonable
tone. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Get 
pissed off, yell at me. Stop being a punching bag, stand
up for 
yourself,&quot; I said angrily. I could feel myself beginning
to fly 
into a rage.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Would that do any good. If I yelled at 
you would you be
more inclined to talk to 
me?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well...&quot; I paused, &quot;No, it 
probably wouldn't,&quot;
I conceded, the anger draining out of 
me.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But let me guess, it's easier to be mad at me than 
it is
to think about all this other shit.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I nodded 
slowly, &quot;Yeah, it is.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's comforting to 
know,&quot; Tom said with a chuckle.
In spite of myself I felt a 
smirk creep onto my face. &quot;Oh
ho, a smile, what a rare 
treat,&quot; Tom said warmly.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You can be a real 
jackass, you know that right?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
He chuckled, &quot;I 
try.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I'm not sure if it was love or relief, but I 
suddenly felt the
urge to hug Tom, which I did.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oof! 
What's this 
for?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Complaining?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh no, 
most certainly not, just curious.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's for 
being here at this moment,&quot; I answered, looking
up at him. 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I guess I should be here more often,&quot; Tom said 
wryly.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;If you really want to go above and beyond the 
call of duty
you'll be here tomorrow.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What 
happens tomorrow?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Brian Wiltson Memorial Pep 
Rally. I hear C-SPAN and
CNN will both be covering it 
live.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Does this have anything to do with that 
armband you're wearing?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
I glanced down and saw that I 
did in fact still have on the armband
I was given in English. I 
quickly tore it off. &quot;It's supposed
to show our solidarity with 
the plight of Brain and everyone like
him,&quot; I 
recited.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Dead people?&quot; Tom asked, 
perplexed.<BR>
<BR>
I shook my head, &quot;Gays who are still in the 
closet.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So this Brian guy was 
gay?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No!&quot; I said sharply. &quot;He wasn't, 
but everyone
thinks so because it makes them feel better. 'Oh, I 
don't have
to worry, he's only killing gays, and I'm not gay. Damn 
shame
about that gay kid though.' It's just your typical Lawndale 
bullshit.&quot;
I fingered the cheaply embroidered rainbow for a 
moment before
tossing it on the ground. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hey, they 
don't know any better. People see a news story
that says all the 
victims were gay and they believe it.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Plus it 
gives the gay community a perfect group of martyrs
for their cause. I 
don't know what's more troubling. The way Brian
died or the way 
people are using him now that he's 
dead.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Especially since he can't stand up for 
himself.&quot; Tom
paused, &quot;I think I just made a pun in really 
bad taste.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Wait, what did you just 
say?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;About the pun?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No, 
what did you mean by the pun?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Just that he's 
dead so he can't speak for himself.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hmm,&quot;I 
could feel an idea begin to form. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;What'cha 
planning?&quot; Tom asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Who says I'm planning 
anything?&quot; I replied coyly. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;You've got that look 
on your face. Come on, let me help
out. Jane used to tell me all 
these stories about who the two
of you would concoct these schemes to 
get back at the people who
pissed you of. I want in on the 
fun.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well ok, I guess you can give me a 
hand,&quot; I said grudgingly.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Great!&quot; Tom 
leaned over and kissed me.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;If you keep that up we wont 
get much scheming done,&quot;
I said before kissing him 
back.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I can live with that,&quot; He said with a grin, 
sometimes
for all his intelligence Tom could be so typically male, as 
Ms.
Barch likes to say.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Get in the car, we've got a 
speech to write,&quot; I ordered
Tom. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yes, 
ma'am.&quot; We got into Tom's rust bucket. As we drove
out of the 
parking lot I saw a man in blue coveralls staring at
me. 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I wonder who that was?&quot; I thought as Tom swung 
the
car onto the street. &quot;Oh well, must have been a plumber 
or
something.&quot; I put the man out of mind and focused on the
task 
in front of me. &quot;Where are we going anyway?&quot; 
I
asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;My house, my parents wont be in until much 
later and Elsie
is staying with some 
friends.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sounds to me like an excellent 
environment to scheme,&quot;
I commented dryly.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's 
what I thought. I figure we can get in several good
hours of scheming 
before you have to go home.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Have I mentioned I 
like the way you think Tom Sloane?&quot;
I said as I leaned over to 
kiss him.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;When you say scheme you do mean make out, 
right?&quot; Tom
asked innocently.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Tom, just drive the 
car.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yes 
ma'am.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
----xxx----xxx----xxx----xxx----xxx----<BR>
<BR> 

Julian Riggins stood and watched as the rusted Jag drove away.
He 
couldn't believe it. That was the girl from the video. She
had been 
standing right there, not a hundred feet away from him.
He had very 
nearly rushed over to talk to her then and there,
but then he saw 
something that had shocked him. A battered car
pulled up next to the 
girl and a boy got out.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No,&quot; he had whispered to 
himself when he saw the two
hug. &quot;She's not supposed to have a 
boyfriend, especially
one who's one of them.&quot; He clenched the 
duffel bag full of
tapes and files tightly as he watched her debase 
herself with
that...boy.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;She's been deceived,&quot; he 
told himself. &quot;That must
be it. He's pulled the wool over her 
eyes, but she has to be shown
the truth, and when she does she'll 
understand everything.&quot;
He watched as the girl drove off. For a 
brief moment she looked
his way and their eyes locked. He felt a 
shiver run down his spine.
&quot;Yes, she's definitely the one I've 
been looking for. I could
follow them now...No, not now, patience. 
The FBI is still here
in force.&quot; He took a deep breath and 
walked to his car. <BR>
<BR>
He walked past a small cluster of FBI 
agents milling around a
black Suburban. His teeth involuntarily bared 
for a moment, the
conversation he'd had with that FBI agent had irked 
him greatly.
It had been a thrill to be that close to the man who was 
trying
to capture him, but still Fraser totally misunderstood 
him.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm not crazy,&quot; he thought to himself. 
&quot;They just
don't understand why I have to do this. But she 
understands, she
can explain it to them, make them understand 
why.&quot; He paused
and collected himself again, now was not the 
time to make a scene.
He'd go home, find out who that girl was and go 
from there. He'd
waited a long time to get to this point, it made no 
sense to blow
it now. He got into his car and drove home. He waved to 
the FBI
agents as he drove past. <BR>
<BR>
&lt;Monday, Lawndale PD, 
Conference Room A 6:30pm&gt;<BR>
<BR>
This was the part of the job I 
hated the most, the endless meetings.
I'd gone charging tactically 
blind into hostile buildings with
less dread than I felt for these 
meetings. Mostly because there
was rarely anything new to discuss at 
them, just mind-numbing
sessions where we'd spin our wheels. At the 
moment we were in
the middle of a conference call with the crew back 
at Quantico.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Steve, good call on the videotape. We 
checked and all the
other schools had camera coverage of school 
grounds. We have agents
going to pick up whatever tapes the schools 
still have right now.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I shrugged, a futile gesture 
when talking on the phone. &quot;Just
luck, I walked in on the 
Lawndale principal talking to a service
guy.&quot; I paused, 
something didn't seem quite right. &quot;They
all had surveillance 
cameras?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah, most of the systems were pretty 
new as well, installed
a couple of weeks before the murders. Only 
good thing to come
out of Columbine I 
guess.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah, lucky us,&quot; I muttered. I knew 
we'd just found
another piece of the puzzle, but I didn't know where 
it went.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What about the ketamine?&quot; Agent Chilton 
asked. &quot;Can
we trace that?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Sarah shook her head. 
&quot;Unfortunately no. There's too much
loose ketamine floating 
around. Every vet in the country has a
supply of the stuff and if 
they come up a little short it just
gets chalked up to teenagers 
looking for a buzz. We could run
a search on all recent purchases, 
but I doubt it will amount to
much.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Do it 
anyway,&quot; I said. &quot;Who knows what it will
turn up.&quot; 
Heads nodded around the table, if nothing else
it was something to 
do. We could at least pretend we were making
headway. &quot;Ok, the 
girl, how's that going?&quot; I asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There's an 
agent, right now it's Agent Lews, near her at
all times, the phone 
tap is in place and we're screening their
mail at the post 
office.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Anything good 
yet?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Depends on what you think good is. We know 
all about the
social life of every eligible bachelor at the high 
school thanks
to the sister, we know that the mother is an 
ass-kissing work-a-holic,
and we know that the father's a head 
case.&quot; Agent Pemberton
looked up from a sheet of paper. 
&quot;Boss, these people never
get off the phone.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The 
table got a chuckle out of the Morgendorffer's 
idiosyncrasies.
&quot;Okay, keep the tap running and send my 
condolences to the
guys listening in on the 
line.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I still don't think we have to worry about 
the girl,&quot;
A disembodied voice from Quantico 
said.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why is that Ray?&quot; Sarah 
asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There's nothing to suggest it. We have three 
additional
dead bodies sure, but all of them died from other causes. 
I think
it's just coincidence.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Then what about 
the phone call and letters?&quot; I asked,
we'd had this debate 
before but it never hurt to go over the facts
again. 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Those are from the killer sure. I think we all agree 
these
killings are messages. He's trying to see if the people who 
found
the bodies got that message. Why that is I don't know, 
probably
from a sense of alienation.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But it 
doesn't hurt to be careful so keep up the observation
right?&quot; I asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No, it doesn't, and we do know that the killer i 
s interested
in her so that might be our avenue to 
him.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We won't use the girl as bait,&quot; I said 
forcefully.
I did not want to face the parents if that blew up in our 
face.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We'll see what you say three weeks from 
now.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I sighed, &quot;We're not getting anywhere, 
let's call it quits
and reconvene tomorrow. Thanks for your input 
guys,&quot; I said
as I killed the line. &quot;Ok people, tomorrow is 
the memorial
service. I'll want a few agents there to keep an eye on 
things.
This weekend we've got the funeral, I'll want a large detail 
there.
Everybody else, keep on doing what you're doing. Alright, 
get
back to it.&quot; The agents got up and started to disperse. 
&quot;Hey
Sarah,&quot; I called 
out.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Could you wait up a 
moment?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sure, what's up 
Steve?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I was just wondering if you'd like to go 
grab some dinner.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sure, I'm 
starving.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Great, then maybe afterward we can 
check out the town some,
I still don't have a really good sense of 
the place.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why Steve, are you asking me out on 
a date? During a case
no less.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Not at all, I 
just want to clear my head for a while and
wanted to know if you'd 
like to do the same.&quot; I replied innocently.
Actually I was 
hoping we'd end up fucking each other senseless
because let's face 
it; Sarah is a damn fine looking woman, and
it had been a long time 
since I'd gotten any action. Of course
I wasn't going to say that to 
her. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I can read your thoughts Steve,&quot; She said 
coyly. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh really?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yes, I can and 
you should be ashamed of yourself, we're
coworkers!&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
Inwardly I winced, never think impure thoughts around a 
person
with a degree in forensic psychology. &quot;Still want to go 
out?&quot;
I asked, going for broke.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hell yes, let's 
go.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I chuckled and offered my arm, &quot;M'lady your 
carriage awaits.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
She took my arm, &quot;Why thank you 
good sir.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm curious, what tipped you off to 
my true intentions?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Sarah laughed, &quot;Years spent 
studying the human animal, plus
you spent the entire meeting staring 
at my breasts.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'll have to work on that won't 
I?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yes, yes you will,&quot; She agreed as we 
walked out of
the conference room. <BR>
<BR>
&lt;Monday, Sloane 
Residence, 8:00pm&gt;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Are you sure all this is 
necessary?&quot; Tom asked me.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What?&quot; I replied, 
looking up from the book I was reading.
We were in the Sloane library 
with lots of books strewn about.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This whole speech, 
are you even sure you'll need to give
it, not to mention will you be 
allowed to give it?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The assembly will be as bad 
as I say it will be, probably
worse. This will most definitely be a 
futile gesture, but I want
to make it.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Plus 
you'll get to tell the school off on national 
television.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There is that,&quot; I admitted. 
&quot;But that's not why
I want to do this.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh 
really, so why?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I paused, then continued, I had to 
talk to somebody. &quot;It
just all seems so wrong to me. They're 
forgetting the basic fact
here in this rush to show tolerance and 
understanding.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What's 
that?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This kid is dead, not because he was gay 
or straight, but
just because. And to use him for their political 
agendas is abusing
his memory just as badly as the killer abused his 
body.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Wow, you really care about this 
guy.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I shook my head, &quot;I never knew him, he 
didn't mean that much
to me.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I know, that's the 
intro to the speech. I helped you write
it.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Tom, you're being flip again,&quot; I said 
threateningly.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sorry, you were 
saying?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's just that there's nobody for him. 
All these people
around and none of them really care about the 
victim.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;And you're the person to do 
that?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I found him Tom, none of these other 
people really know
what happened to him.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And 
you're the person who does?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Not entirely, but I 
saw what that twisted bastard did to
that boy. I could feel the 
madness required to do such a thing.
I'm the one who keeps seeing him 
in my nightmares.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You're having nightmares about 
it?&quot; Tom asked, instantly
concerned. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Wouldn't 
you?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Probably, but tell me about 
yours.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Not much to say Brian's in them and he's 
trying to tell
me something but I can't hear 
it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why not?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Because 
there's this other voice shouting over him.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So 
you think this other voice is the crap that's being said
about him 
now that he's dead.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's a really good 
interpretation, I'll use that,&quot;
I said quickly. 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That wasn't what you 
thought?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No, I thought it was the killer,&quot; 
I mumbled. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;But isn't that the same? The killer is 
also obscuring the
truth about Brian's life by killing 
him.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I suppose.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why do I 
get the feeling you think it has nothing to do
with Brian?&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Because I don't, every time I think about the park I 
hear
that voice, and quite frankly I thought I was going 
insane.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Are you?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Agent 
Fraser doesn't seem to think so. He said it's just
me not being able 
to deal with what I saw.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;He sounds like a pretty 
smart guy.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I guess so, and I will say this, 
since we've started working
on this speech I haven't heard the 
voice.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There you go, you're not 
insane.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm still not one hundred percent sure 
about that.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;If it helps I don't think you're 
nuts,&quot; Tom said before
hugging me. Of course at that moment 
Tom's mother walked into
the library. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh, pardon me, 
I didn't mean to interrupt anything.&quot;
Mrs. Sloane said in what 
sounded like a not quite sincere voice.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's ok Mom, 
what do you need?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Actually I was looking for 
Daria. You're mother called,
she wanted to know when you'd be coming 
home.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I looked over at the clock and saw how late it 
had gotten. &quot;Oh,
right, is she still on the 
phone?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No, she said she had another call.&quot; 
Mrs. Sloane frowned
slightly, &quot;Your mother is a very driven 
woman isn't she?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What is this about?&quot; I 
wondered to myself. &quot;Uh
yes, I guess she 
is.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm the chairwoman of the local chapter of 
NOW and we're
looking for someone to name Businesswoman of the Year. 
Naturally
I thought your mother would be an ideal choice. A committed 
lawyer
with one of the largest law firms in Lawndale, and yet she's 
still
managed to find the time to raise two daughters. Why, we 
could
use her as a poster woman for a national campaign 
celebrating
the working mother.&quot; Trust me, on the inside I was 
laughing
my ass off. &quot;Do you think she'd be interested in the 
nomination?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I paused, unsure of how to respond. 
&quot;On one hand an award
like this would be great for mom, and a 
real honor,&quot; I told
myself. &quot;But it would also probably 
shove her into one of
those overly maternal guilt ridden fits she's 
prone to. Then again
how many times do you get to do something nice 
for your mother
while being critical of her at the same time?&quot; I 
smirked.
&quot;She'd love it Mrs. 
Sloane.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Excellent, I'll give her the good news 
tomorrow, in person,
maybe as a lunch date, and take the opportunity 
to have a good
mother to mother chat about our two babies.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Damn,&quot; I swore to myself, &quot;Uh, Mom' 
s usually too
busy at the firm for lunch.&quot; I said quickly, 
trying to dissuade
Mrs. Sloane. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh nonsense, I'll 
just call Eric Schrecter tomorrow and
tell him to give his star 
lawyer an uninterrupted hour for lunch.&quot;
There are times when it 
can be damn annoying having a boyfriend
whose parents are two of the 
most powerful members of the community.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm sure Mom 
will appreciate that more than the award,&quot;
I said dryly. 
<BR>
<BR>
She laughed, &quot;I'm sure.&quot; She looked around the 
room.
&quot;Just what exactly are the two of you working on, if I 
might
ask.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Tom glanced at me before speaking. 
&quot;We were putting together
a little speech for the memorial 
service for that student who
died over the 
weekend.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh, the gay boy?&quot; I winced when I 
heard that. &quot;The
GLBA has approached the Sloane Foundation about 
a grant to fund
more educational programs in high 
schools.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But what if he wasn't gay?&quot; I 
asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;All this 
talk is dependent on one fact, that Brain was gay,
but what if he 
wasn't gay?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Daria, dear, that changes nothing, 
the Gay Lesbian and Bisexual
Alliance still needs the money, and can 
put it to good use. If
the unfortunate fate of this poor boy makes it 
easier, then that's
a positive to come out of a 
tragedy.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So you don't believe he was 
gay?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I didn't say that. The FBI has said the 
killer stalks then
kills these boys, and that he's a homophobe. I can 
put two and
two together. And I must say I'm glad the two of you are 
dating.
Tom does look something like the boy who was killed. I'd 
hate
to see anything happen to my son just because he looks like 
some
psychopath's mental image of a gay person...not that I'd 
love
you any less if you were Tom.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;You might be 
interested to hear that Brian, the boy who
was killed, dated my 
sister,&quot; I said nastily. The cross expression
on Mrs. Sloane's 
face told me my welcome was wearing thin. &quot;I'd
better head home, 
don't want Mom to get too worried, bye Mrs.
Sloane.&quot; I started 
to walk out of the room.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'll give her a ride home, 
I'll be back soon,&quot; Tom
said quickly. He then rushed to catch up 
with me. &quot;That wasn't
a very nice thing to do to my 
mother.&quot; He said when we were
out of earshot. 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;She has only herself to blame,&quot; I said curtly. 
&quot;She's
the one who's buying into a lie to make herself feel 
better.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Still you didn't have to cut her down 
like that.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I sighed, &quot;No, probably not. Would 
you mind apologizing for
me when you get the 
chance?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Tom chuckled, &quot;I'll be sure to mention 
that you've been pretty
stressed out 
lately.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Thanks, I think.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh 
hey, I think you'll need this.&quot; Tom handed me a
small collection 
of three by five cards.<BR>
<BR>
I took them and briefly scanned the 
first one. It was the text
of my speech. &quot;You're probably right, 
thanks.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;You're going to go through with this 
aren't you?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I think so, it's something that 
needs to be done.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Then go with god Don 
Quixote.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Only if you drive me home Sancho,&quot; 
I replied. That's
why I liked hanging out with the boy, he can keep 
up with me.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Certainly, but we won't be stopping for 
any windmills will
we?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Don't worry, the 
windmills are on the schedule for tomorrow,
I'm conserving my energy 
till then.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Tom frowned, &quot;Hey wait a minute, I'm 
Sancho?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;What's wrong with being 
Sancho?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Nothing I just thought that Jane would 
be a better Sancho.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And that leaves you as 
who?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why Dulcinea of 
course.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I hate to be the one to breakthis to you 
Tom, but you'd
look terrible in a dress.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Like 
you'd look any better in a battered suit of 
armor.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Point taken, well in this version of the 
story Quixote and
Sancho have a different sort of 
relationship.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I have no problem with that,&quot; 
Tom replied before leaning
over and kissing me.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Are 
you sure that's a good idea, we are standing on your
front porch 
after all.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Do you 
really want to have a little chat with your parents
about the virtues 
of prenuptial agreements?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You make a good point. 
Come on, let's go somewhere a little
more 
secluded.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I was thinking we go to my house 
before my mom calls out
the National Guard.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Not 
to mention the FBI.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They're already following 
me,&quot; I pointed to a nondescript
sedan sitting parked across the 
street. &quot;Wave to the nice
agents.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;How long 
did you say they'd be hanging around?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Another 
month or so, why?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Because I figure that's about 
how long it'll be before we
can find a quiet place to 
ourselves.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Think you can wait that 
long?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't know, I might have to find 
somebody new for the
interim.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Tom that was 
decidedly not funny. You are this close to
getting the ever loving 
shit beaten out of you.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh hell Daria, I'm 
sorry. That was incredibly stupid of
me.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It 
was, and I'm not going to let you off easily either.&quot;
I wasn't 
going to say so but the jackass had just touched on one
of my deeper 
fears about our relationship, that he'd get bored
with me and move on 
to someone else.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It was a totally thoughtless thing 
for me to say. How can
I make it up to you?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I stared 
at Tom for a long while. It was a little unfair of me
to punish him 
for my neurosis, but on the other hand he did have
a disturbing habit 
of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time.
I sighed, &quot;For 
starters you can take me home. Then you can
meet me outside school 
after that assembly.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And after 
that?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We go from there.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Now 
that I can do. Shall we go?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No, I want to 
campout on your front porch.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Okay, okay it was 
a dumb question. I was just trying to
be polite, sue 
me.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Never tell the daughter of Helen 
Morgendorffer that,&quot;
I said, smirking. <BR>
<BR>
Tom chuckled, 
&quot;Yeah, you're right, forget I said anything.&quot;
We walked to 
Tom's car. &quot;Oh, what did you think of the award
for your 
mother?&quot; He asked as he helped open my door.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I 
think it's deliciously twisted, do I sense your sick brain
at 
work?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Tom slid into the driver's seat of the car. 
&quot;Your mother's
name might have been casually mentioned at an 
opportune moment
by a certain evil genius. Do you 
approve?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;How could I not? Not only does it give 
her career a boost,
but it'll provide for years of guilt over her 
parenting skills.
I couldn't have planned it any better.&quot; I 
leaned over and
kissed him. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;So I'm 
forgiven?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Tom you just 'got' my mother better 
than I have in my entire
life, of course I forgive 
you.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Even though our moms are going to be having 
lunch together?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Law of unintended consequences. 
Besides, I'm sure your mother
has plenty of juicy stories to share 
too.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Tom pounded the steering wheel. 
&quot;Damn!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&lt;Monday, Home of Julian Riggins, 11:21 
PM&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Riggins closed the file in front of him, &quot;So 
her, name is
Daria Morgendorffer.&quot; He ran his hand over the 
lettering
on the folder. &quot;Daria,&quot; he said again, letting 
the name
roll off his tongue, &quot;Daria, Daria, Daria, we're going 
to
have quite a talk you and I. I'm going to show you just why 
I'm
doing this so you can tell everyone.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
He frowned, 
he had looked over all the tapes and he still had
not found the boy 
he had seen Daria with that afternoon. &quot;Who
was he?&quot; 
Riggins wondered. &quot;Oh well, it doesn't really
matter who he is. 
I'll use him to show Daria the truth. Once she
sees how he's used her 
she'll agree to help me, no, she'll beg
to help me.&quot; He stood up 
and walked into another room, moving
past a large picture of a man in 
a Marine uniform. He had a lot
to do to prepare for Daria's arrival. 
He took a pad and pencil
from his bag, but first he was going to 
check the quality of the
picture the surveillance cameras were 
taking. He had promised
Li that he was going to do it, and Julian 
Riggins was a man of
his word, if nothing else.<BR>
<BR>
&lt;Tuesday, 
Lawndale PD Crime Lab, Tuesday, 1:30pm&gt; <BR>
<BR>
I rubbed the 
bridge of my nose in frustration. I'd been helping
the video techs 
look over the surveillance tapes from the various
schools in the 
hopes of spotting the killer, or at least catching
a break. So far 
we'd come up with squat.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Keep at it guys,&quot; I told 
the techs. &quot;I'm going
to get some coffee.&quot; I walked out of 
the lab and headed for
the coffee maker. I fished my cell phone from 
a jacket pocked
and dialed a number. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Pemberton? It's 
Fraser, has the memorial started yet? Ok,
let me know if you see 
anything out of the ordinary.&quot; I broke
the connection and dialed 
another number, &quot;Grisman? It's
Fraser, the memorial service is 
about to start. Is everything
set on your end? Yes I know it's a 
stupid question, I'm the boss
remember. Just do your job and let me 
know if anything comes up.&quot;
I ended the call and poured three 
cups of coffee.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Anything good guys?&quot; I asked as I 
walked back into
the lab. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sorry Agent Fraser, nothing 
yet,&quot; Agent Sorenstam,
the senior tech told me before helping 
himself to a cup of coffee.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't think we're going 
to find the guy on the tapes.&quot;
The other tech, Agent Kirkdale, 
said.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why is that?&quot; I asked as I handed Kirkdale 
the other
cup of coffee. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Kirkdale took 
a sip of the coffee then made
a face. &quot;Basically if he was 
staking out the school's in
view of these cameras we would have 
spotted him.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;How can you be so 
sure?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Because as we've been watching the tape 
it's been fed into
the computer which looks over the film and 
catalogs every time
someone who fits the killer's physical profile 
appears. It them
runs the person's picture through the DMV database 
and spits out
its findings.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Wow, that's pretty 
cool.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's not perfect, but it's a major 
timesaver.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's good because you're about to 
get a lot more tape.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The network feeds of that 
school service?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I nodded, &quot;We're getting copies 
of everything they tape,
and CNN agreed to have a couple cameras 
trained on the crowd at
all time for reaction 
shots.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Nice touch.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's 
what I thought, it was Agent Seda's idea. The blind
pig theory at 
work.&quot; The two techs chuckled dutifully and
got back to work. I 
toyed with a tape case as they worked. &quot;Hey
guys, I've got a 
question for you. All the Lawndale tapes have
been gone over, 
right?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah, why?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Were any 
of those tapes from in the school? Classrooms,
bathrooms, that sort 
of thing?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No, it was all exterior shots, why do 
you ask?&quot; Sorenstam
replied. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Because the school 
was filled with surveillance gear, and
I was curious if any of those 
tapes were turned over.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well no, we didn't see 
anything like that, isn't that illegal
anyway?&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Honestly, I have no idea, depends on the state I 
think,
but it's definitely bad public relations to admit you're 
videotaping
everything your students are 
doing.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I wouldn't be too sure about that these 
days boss. I'm waiting
for schools to have riot cops on standby 
twenty-four seven,&quot;
Kirkdale commented.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Keeps us 
in business I guess,&quot; I offered lamely. &quot;Ok,
so the 
Principal of the school has a clandestine video surveillance
system 
in place, probably paid for with diverted school funds.
Do we 
care?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Agent Sorenstam shrugged, &quot;I'm just a 
tech, but I'd say no,
the principal doesn't have any obvious ties to 
the other killings
right?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I nodded, &quot;Nope, she 
doesn't.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So hand it off to the local PD or the 
RICO people and see
if they have a case, but what do i know, I'm just 
a tech. I'm
sure you'll talk about it during a strategy session, or 
whatever
it is you profilers do.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;No, you're 
right, it's not a part of the scope of the case,
we don't have to 
pursue it.&quot; I felt like there was something
to the cameras but I 
couldn't think of what. &quot;I'll mention
it to Agent Raines when 
she gets back from canvassing,&quot; I
promised myself.<BR>
<BR>
My 
phone rang, &quot;Fraser here.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Agent Fraser, 
it's Grisman, are you watching this 
service?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You should 
be.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Just turn it on, 
you wont like it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Great,&quot; I reached over an 
turned on a small TV. As
the screen came to life the picture resolved 
to a shot of Daria
Morgendorffer. &quot;Oh shit.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The phone beeped, telling me 
there was another call. &quot;Thanks
for telling me Grisman, keep 
sharp.&quot; I broke link with Grisman
and answered the new call. 
&quot;Fraser here.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Fraser, it's Pemberton, we've 
got a problem.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I watched the TV, 
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&lt;Tuesday, Lawndale High Gym, 1:30 
P.M.&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Jane and I were sitting towards the back of the 
bleachers watching
the gym fill up. Attendance at this even was of 
course mandatory.
From where I was sitting I could see my sister and 
the rest of
the Fashion Club primping themselves in preparation for 
their
close ups. The football team was sitting in uniform on a 
garishly
decorated stage set at one end of the gym. The TV cameras 
were
positioned on the other end with a couple of cameramen 
wandering
around, filming the crowd. There were also several serious 
looking
men in suits trying to blend in with the television crews. 
The
other section of bleachers and the remaining floor space was 
filled
with people from the town.. Large banners hung from the 
ceiling
and students held signs with such pithy messages as 
&quot;Brian
we'll miss you,&quot; or &quot;Brian we'll always love 
you.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ten bucks says the 'non-denominational' 
benediction turns
quite denominational before it's done,&quot; Jane 
commented as
she read through the program.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No deal, 
that's a suckers bet.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Damn, ah well, it was 
worth a shot. Oh look, most of the
agenda is dedicated to 'student 
reflections.' Think it would look
bad if a TV camera caught me 
asleep?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Don't worry, I'll make it 
lively.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;How...you're going to speak aren't 
you?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I was thinking about doing an interpretive 
dance, but I
just didn't have the time to perfect the 
choreography.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So, what'cha gonna talk about? And 
why wasn't I in on it?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Wait and see. Tom really 
wanted a turn at being my partner-in-crime,
and who was I do deny him 
that?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Daria, is there anything you wouldn't deny 
Tom?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;My 
toothbrush.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Attention students!&quot; Ms. Li's 
voice cut Jane off. &quot;Before
we get started, and the cameras turn 
on, let me remind you all
that there will be no inappropriate 
behavior directed at the cameras,
do no even think about bringing 
that sort of dishonor on Lawndale
High at such a glor...er I mean 
tragic moment.&quot; A man in
a headset flashed Li a thumbs up. 
&quot;It seems we will be going
live soon.&quot; The man started 
counting down, &quot;So remember,
best behavior or you'll get 
it.&quot; The director reached zero
before Li finished. &quot;Er, are 
we live?&quot; She asked, the
director nodded. &quot;Ah, welcome 
everyone to the Brian Wiltson
Memorial Service. I'm Angela Li, the 
principal of Lawndale High.
I would like to ask Reverand Ernest Rabb 
of the United Episcopalian
Church to lead us in a non-denominational 
benediction.&quot; Li
returned to her seat on the dais, next to 
several &quot;important&quot;
members of the Lawndale community. 
<BR>
<BR>
A minister stood up from his seat and solemnly walked to 
the podium.
&quot;Let us pray,&quot; he intoned. Everyone around me 
bowed
their heads. <BR>
<BR>
Now I admit I've always felt a little 
awkward in such situations.
I don't share these people's beliefs, but 
I also don't want to
appear totally insensitive, especially during 
something of the
assembly's nature. I stole a glance at Jane to try 
and take a
cue from her, but saw that she had assumed the lotus 
position
and appeared to be intently mediating. I decided that was 
something
I didn't want to do while wearing a skirt and settled on a 
middle
ground of staring at my lap. The minister droned on and I 
took
the opportunity to go over my speech one last 
time.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;...and all blessings flow from you oh Lord, 
Amen.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Amen,&quot; the crowd 
murmured.<BR>
<BR>
I nudged Jane, &quot;Hey Jane, wake 
up.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Jane opened her eyes, &quot;I wasn't asleep.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Could've fooled me.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I was 
practicing my faith, Zen Buddhism.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Zen 
Buddhism?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah my family lived in a Zen Buddhist 
temple for several
months when I was little. So now whenever anyone 
asks me what
my religion is I say Zen 
Buddhist.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why am I not 
surprised.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So I wasn't sleeping I was working on 
attaining oneness
while being distracted like the monks who meditate 
while being
beaten.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There's a big difference 
between 'meditating' during a sermon
and having your fellow monks 
beat on you.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well, I'm a lapsed Zen Buddhist, I 
have to work up to the
beatings.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;When you do 
let me know I'll be glad to help with the beatings,
and next time 
you're 'achieving oneness' try not to snore.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I 
wasn't snoring!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Thank you Reverend Rabb for that 
moving benediction. Now,
if all the students who wish to share their 
thoughts on Brian's
life and the impact he had, please line up next 
to the stage,&quot;
Li told the audience. <BR>
<BR>
I stood up, 
&quot;That's my cue.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Who's to say Li will let 
you talk?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;She has to, the cameras are 
rolling.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Good point, god speed 
Morgendorffer.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Thanks, I'll call you 
tonight.&quot; I walked down to the
gym floor and made my way to a 
slowly forming line at the foot
of the stage. I fell into line behind 
Jodie.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Daria? What are you doing 
here?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What, this isn't the line for the 
re-education center?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
To her credit Jodie failed to 
rise to the bait. &quot;You're going
to say a few words? I'm 
impressed...wait a minute, just what are
you going to say?&quot; She 
asked suspiciously.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm just going to say that Brian's 
death was a great tragedy.
I figured it would look bad if you were 
the only person to say
something cogent.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Right, 
but if it's all the same to you I think I'll let
you go after 
me.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's probably for the 
best.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh great, they're letting Kevin 
talk,&quot; Jodie sighed
as we watched Kevin walk up to the 
podium.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Of course, we want to put our best foot 
forward.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our best foot?&quot; Jodie asked 
dubiously.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Foot, ass, same difference.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hey, I'm Kevin Thompson. Brian was my teammate, and he w 
as
a really cool guy. He never acted gay around me or any of 
the
other guys. But everyone says he was gay, so I guess he was. 
So,
if Brian was gay, and still a cool guy then...&quot; Kevin 
was
obviously building momentum, &quot;I'm gay 
too!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Kevie, no!&quot; Brittany 
shrieked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's okay babe, I'll always have time for 
you...&quot; Kevin
said as he walked away from the 
microphone.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They sure broke the mold when they made 
Kevin,&quot; Jodie
commented. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah, on purpose,&quot; 
I added. &quot;So, what are you
going to say?&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh you know, how Brian's death was a tragedy and 
illustrates
how all minorities have to 
unify...&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And overthrow the Imperial 
Overlords.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Daria, that's not what I 
meant.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I know, what you meant was that the 
struggle for acceptance
is universal among all minorities, regardless 
of race, creed or
sexuality, and by coming together you can make the 
task of bringing
understanding to the majority that much 
easier.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You read my notes didn't 
you.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I shook my head, &quot;No, but it did seem like 
the sort of thing
you'd say in a situation like 
this.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What's that supposed to mean?&quot; Jodie 
asked, her eyes
narrowing to slits.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Just that when 
push comes to shove you tent to bow to the
force of political 
expediency.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Daria, that's not true, and that 
you'd even think that is...&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Save your righteous 
indignation for later, you're on.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Jodie turned and 
saw that the podium was open. &quot;We'll talk
about this 
later.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Knock 'em dead,&quot; I called out as she 
walked up to the
podium. I tuned out most of Jodie's speech. It 
pretty much went
as I thought it would. As she talked I steeled 
myself for my turn
on the dais. &quot;You can do this Morgendorffer. 
There aren't
any cameras, there's no national audience, these people 
in the
theater aren't really here. Just get up there and speak your 
mind,
full speed ahead.&quot; I kept repeating that mantra until 
Jodie
walked past.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Your turn Daria,&quot; Jodie said 
as she walked past me.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Great, wish me 
luck.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's remarkably 
unspecific.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You may or may not like what I'm 
going to say, so I figured
I'd give you some 
leeway.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well, good luck 
Daria.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Thanks,&quot; I took a deep breath and 
walked up to the
podium. A man wearing a headset and holding a 
clipboard met me.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What's your name?&quot; He asked in 
a bored manner. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Daria Morgendorffer,&quot; I spelled 
it for him. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;And what are you going to be talking 
about?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The real tragedy of Brian's death,&quot; 
I replied blandly.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ok, no profanity or obscene 
gestures, if you do we yank
you, and please keep your comments short. 
Sign here please.&quot;
He handed me the clipboard and a pen. 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What's this?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;A release so we can 
put your name and image on TV, plus
it gives CNN the rights to use 
your likeness and anything you
might say in future 
programming.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I shrugged, and signed the release, 
&quot;Whatever, can I go up
there now?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sure, 
oh, one more thing, if you feel the need to cry, go
with it.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
I stared at the producer darkly, &quot;I'll keep that in 
mind.&quot;
I walked up to the podium. I took the index cards holding 
my speech
out of my pocket and placed them in front of me. The 
microphone
was a little too high so I adjusted it. I scanned the 
audience
as I collected myself. I saw Tom sitting in the crowd. Our 
eyes
met and he flashed me a thumbs up. Despite whatever else you 
might
say about the boy, he certainly was supportive. I closed my 
eyes,
took a deep breath and began to speak. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hello, 
my name is DariaMorgendorffer, Brian Wiltson didn't
mean anything to 
me while he was alive. He was just another face
in my English class. 
Brian did mean something to other people
though. My friend Jane liked 
to stare at him when our teacher
wasn't saying anything important, 
which was most of the time.
My sister Quinn went out on dates with 
him, as she does with most
of the male students in school. She also 
thought he was a 'really
nice guy.' I suspect if given the chance 
Quinn would have happily
pursued a more serious, steady relationship 
with Brian. And apparently
the football team thought he was a cool 
dude. But now he's dead,
and here's the odd thing, he still means 
different things to different
people, only now those meanings are 
radically different. My sister
Quinn is sad because the second person 
she's ever felt romantically
inclined towards is dead, and then 
everyone else is sad because,
guess what, Brian was really gay. So 
now he's a martyr for the
gay right's cause. But none of that really 
means anything to me
either, mostly because Brain Wiltson wasn't 
gay.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
I moved on to the next index card. &quot;Yes, I 
know what the
papers said, but I also pay attention to what the 
people investigating
the case say, which is that none of the victims 
were gay. However,
since it makes us feel better if we think the 
victims were different
from us we made Brian gay. Since it advances 
one interest group's
political agenda they made Brian gay. Since it's 
a more sensational
news story if the victims have hidden lives the 
media made Brian
gay. Brian's actual life isn't important, what's 
important is
that the GLBA gets their grant from the Sloane 
foundation, what's
important is that we all buy those ugly armbands 
that Ms. Li is
selling at a substantial profit. Through these actions 
we're killing
the memory of Brian just as brutally as the madman who 
killed
Brian's body.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I flipped to my third card. 
&quot;Now as I've said, Brian didn't
mean anything to me while he was 
alive so people might be wondering
why I'm speaking up now. The 
answer is simple, I was the person
who found Brian's mangled corpse 
Saturday. Brian might not have
meant anything to me while he was 
alive, but in death he means
a great deal to me.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I knew it!&quot; Kevin shouted, &quot;She's always 
been
weird and into freaky things, she did it!&quot; Mack reached 
over
and clamped his hand over Kevin's mouth.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Brian 
died a horrible, senseless death, and that is the
point. Yes, the 
causes espoused from this dais are noble and worthy,
but not at the 
cost of one poor boy's memory. Thank you, and good
day.&quot; I 
gathered my note cards, walked off the stage and
headed for the doors 
of the gym. Tom got up out of his seat and
headed towards the exit to 
meet me. Out of the corner of my eye
I could see Jane doing the same. 
They caught up with me outside
the gym.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Damn Daria, 
you really do know how to bring the house down,&quot;
Jane said 
appreciatively.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You did great Daria,&quot; Tom said, 
hugging me. &quot;But
I think we need to beat a hasty retreat before 
the press descends
on you.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Good point, Jane 
we'll catch up with you at your house in
a little 
while.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And where are you going to 
be?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Finishing this, and I need a car to do that, 
otherwise Tom
wouldn't be invited either.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ok, 
but don't take too long you two.&quot; Jane waved and
took off. 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So where are we going?&quot; Tom asked as I led him 
through
the school. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The park, I need to pay some 
respects.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
We drove to the park in silence, I didn't 
want to say anything
and Tom didn't seem to know what to say. When 
the car came to
a stop he did manage to find his 
tongue.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Mind telling me why we're 
here?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Because I have to tell Brian I did what he 
was asking me
to do.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So you can see dead people 
now?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Quiet you, this is 
important.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sorry, sorry, so, what was Brian 
asking you to do?&quot;
Tom help up the police tape for 
me.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What do you think, tell the truth about 
him.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Not exactly a hard task for 
you.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It did involve public speaking, cameras, 
and a national
audience.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;True, but that also 
means you got a bigger soapbox to stand
on.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So 
you're saying I was just looking for a way to stroke
my 
ego?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No, just that your assigned task seems to 
be something you'd
do anyway.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The dead know me 
very well, what can I say.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Helps that you're the 
one interpreting what the dead are
telling 
you.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hey jackass, focus,&quot; I said sharply. 
Tom could piss
me off intensely at times, Another reason I liked 
having him around,
he affected me.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh sorry, so we're 
here so you can pay your last respects?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Pretty 
much, putting it behind me in order to go forward.
Also, I feel like 
I picked up an unwanted weight in that clearing
and the only way to 
put it down is to go back there.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What about the 
killer?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I frowned, &quot;I'm not going to let some 
chimera rule my life.
I have to do what's necessary for me to live my 
life.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Would now be a good time to point out that 
you can't live
your life when you're 
dead?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's why the FBI is here,&quot; I 
countered. We walked
into the clearing. I remember it seemed brighter 
than it had on
Saturday. Other than a rust-colored stain on the grass 
you'd never
know what had happened here. &quot;It's so...quiet,&quot; 
I said.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well yeah, what did you expect?&quot; Tom 
asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't really know, just not this much 
normalcy.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Tom shrugged, &quot;Nature at work I 
guess.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I guess,&quot; I replied. I walked over 
to the stain and
knelt down next to it. &quot;Well Brian, I've done 
my best for
you, and put my own ass on the line. I hope it's enough 
for you.&quot;
I stood back up and turned to face Tom. &quot;Ok, 
that's all I
wanted to do.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Feeling better for 
doing so?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I considered the question for a moment. 
&quot;Yeah, I think I
do.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Great, let's go to 
Jane's...&quot; Tom started to say. After
that all I could remember 
was a large form appearing suddenly,
me falling backwards, then 
nothing.<BR>
<BR>
----xxx----xxx----xxx----xxx----xxx----<BR>
<BR>
Jul 
ian Riggins couldn't believe his luck, for the second time
in as many 
days he saw Daria Morgendorffer leaving the school
at the same time 
he was. He had been at the school to fix the
cameras like he had 
promised. It meant he had to miss watching
the assembly on 
television, but he had two VCR's recording it.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It 
must be a sign,&quot; he thought. &quot;I'll follow them
and show 
Daria the truth, but take them where to do so?&quot;
he wondered as 
he followed Tom's Jag. &quot;Of course, that would
be the perfect 
spot, it will bring everything full circle,&quot;
he said to himself 
as realization hit. He watched as the Jag pulled
into the parking lot 
of High Hills Park.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I wonder why they came here?&quot; 
Riggins pondered as he
found a parking space for his van. There were 
only a few other
cars in the lot, which suited Riggins just fine. He 
climbed into
the back of the van and readied himself. He filled two 
syringes
with ketamine and tucked his knife into his coveralls. 
Riggins
got out of the van and entered the park, he had a good idea 
where
Daria was going.<BR>
<BR>
Riggins made his way quietly through 
the park. &quot;No son of
Max Riggins is going to go crashing through 
the forest,&quot;
he quoted to himself. AS he got closer to the site 
where he had
punished the boy he saw a man in a suit looking the 
wrong way.
Riggins recognized the man from the Lawndale High parking 
lot
the previous day.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So, one of the FBI agents is 
keeping an eye on Daria, well
we can't have that.&quot; Riggins crept 
up behidn the agent and
withdrew his knife. In one swift motion he 
grabbed the agent and
slashed his knife across the other man's 
throat. Riggins let the
man drop as he jumped back to avoid the spray 
of arterial blood
gushing from the agent's neck. Riggins watched, 
disinterestedly
as the other man bled out and became still. He 
cleaned the knife
on the dead man's clothes and continued 
on.<BR>
<BR>
He stopped short of the clearing and watched Daria and 
Tom talk,
they were speaking in muted tones so he couldn't make out 
what
they were saying. &quot;He's probably trying to convince her 
she
needs to feel bad about the boy's death, but she knows 
better.
From their body language it was obvious the two were having 
a
disagreement.<BR>
<BR>
He decided to move while they were 
distracted He ran up behind
them and hit Tom on the back of the head 
with the hilt of his
knife. Daria turned to see what had happened, 
Riggins swept her
feet out form under her and she fell to the ground 
hard. Before
Daria could recover, Riggins jabbed one of the syringes 
into her
arm. He injected the other dose of ketamine into Tom's arm 
and
dragged the unconscious teens into the bushes. Taking great 
care
not to be seen Riggins carried his captives out to his 
vane.<BR>
<BR>
For a moment he debated what to do about Tom's car. 
&quot;Let
the thing rot,&quot; he concluded. &quot;It'll take too 
long to
ditch it, and by the time anyone realizes these two are 
missing
we'll all be far away.&quot; Before starting the van Riggins 
bound
Daria and Tom's hands and feet with sturdy plastic bindings. 
Satisfied
they were both securely tied Riggins started the van and 
drove
away.<BR>
<BR>
&lt;Tuesday, Morgendorffer Residence, 4:47 
PM&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I parked the rental care near the Morgendorffer 
house, there were
already several Lawndale PD patrol cars there, as 
well as a small
cluster of TV vans.<BR>
<BR>
Sarah got out of the 
car, &quot;First thing to do is get rid of
the press.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
I nodded, &quot;Yeah, how?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We could 
kill them.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I shook my head, &quot;They're like the 
hydra, chop one head off
and two grow back in its place. Hey, I've 
got an idea, why don't
you go out and put on a sex show, that'll 
distract them.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You know, that is considered 
sexual harassment. I could
sue the pants off you for that 
remark.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You don't have to sue me to get my pants 
off.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Cute, but it doesn't solve the problem of 
the reporters.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Get back in the car, we'll drive 
around the block and approach
the house from the 
rear.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What is it with you and this sneaky 
shit?&quot; Sarah asked
as we drove around the 
block.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I still think I'm a government killer 
remember.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;You mean you're not? Aren't you the 
guy who helps trains
Hostage Rescue Teams? And you know they are 
nothing more than
death squads for the New World 
Order.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ok, that's it, no more conspiracy 
newsgroups for you.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sure, spoil all my fun, I 
post to them with my government
account you 
know.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Figure,&quot; I grumbled as I parked the 
car. &quot;Come
on, let's go be sneaky.&quot; We walked through the 
neighbor's
yard and made our way to the back of the Morgendorffers' 
house.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Now what, we break in?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I flipped 
out my cell phone, &quot;Tempting, but no.&quot; I dialed
the 
Morgendorffers' number. &quot;Hello Mrs. Morgendorffer, it's
Agent 
Fraser, yes I want to talk to you too. How about you open
up your 
back door? Great.&quot; I returned the phone to my 
pocket.
&quot;Problem solved.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Smart 
ass.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The back door opened and Helen Morgendorffer's 
head appeared.
&quot;Hello, Agent Fraser?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Right 
here Mrs. Morgendorffer,&quot; I said, moving into
her field of view. 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh good, come in,&quot; She opened the door wider to 
let
us in. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Thank-you Mrs. Morgendorffer. I'd like you 
to meet my partner,
Special Agent Sarah 
Raines.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;How do you do Agent 
Raines.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's good to meet you Mrs. 
Morgendorffer,&quot; Sarah replied
warmly. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh please, 
call me Helen.&quot; She turned to face me again.
&quot;Now, Agent 
Fraser, what happened to my daughter?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I took a deep 
breath, this wasn't going to be fun, &quot;Someone,
probably our 
killer, has kidnapped your daughter and the person
she was with at 
the time, her boyfriend we 
think.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Tom?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yes, 
Tom.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;How could you let that happen? When did 
that happen? How&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
I held up my hands, &quot;Why don't 
I tell you what I know first,
and then you can ask questions, or 
punch my lights out.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
She nodded, &quot;Yes, right, 
fine.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why don't we talk about this sitting 
down?&quot; Sarah offered.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Of course, we can sit in 
the living room, Jake and Jane
will want to hear this 
too.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
We walked into the living room. There were a 
couple police officers
talking to Mr. Morgendorffer and a girl who 
looked to be about
Daria's age. I motioned for one of the officers to 
talk to me.
&quot;You guys can take off,&quot; I told the officer 
quietly.
&quot;And try to take the press with you. Tell them it was a 
reported
break-in or something.&quot; The officer nodded and waved to 
his
partner. The two cops left the house.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ok, just 
what the damn hell is going on damnit? Where's
my damn daughter 
damnit!&quot; Mr. Morgendorffer shouted as his
face turned a 
spectacular shade of red.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Jake, your heart!&quot; His 
wife scolded.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Damnit Helen, forget my damn heart. This 
is Daria we're
talking about, now what the hell happened to her 
damnit!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I sighed, this was the part of the job that I 
hated. &quot;Here's
what we know Mr. Morgendorffer. At around two o 
clock Daria left
the high school with a boy around her 
age.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That was Tom, her boyfriend,&quot; the 
black haired girl
said.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And you 
are?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Jane Lane, friend of 
Daria.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Right, nice to finally meet you. They 
were followed to High
Hills Park by one of my 
agents.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's where I figured they were 
going,&quot; the girl,
Jane, chimed in.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;How did you 
know that?&quot; I asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;D'uh, she told me. I talked 
to her right before she and
Tom left the school. They were supposed 
to go to my house when
she was done with some 
errand.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So why do you think she was headed for 
the park?&quot; Sarah
asked.<BR>
<BR>
Jane shrugged, &quot;She said 
she was going to finish something.
Considering what all has happened 
the past few days the park seemed
a likely place for something to 
finish.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I nodded, &quot;Astute guess, she did go to 
the park, and that's
the last thing we know for sure. Agent Chilton, 
the agent keeping
an eye on Daria was found dead near the original 
murder site.
There are a few signs of a struggle as well. What I 
think happened
is that our killer murdered Agent Chilton, then 
subdued Daria
and Tom and took them 
somewhere.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We also found a syringe that 
contained traces of the drug
ketamine, it's a powerful 
anesthetic,&quot; Sarah added, &quot;We
found traces of the same drug 
in Brian's body which is why we
think the same person is behind both 
acts.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But why did it take you so long to realize 
Daria was missing?&quot;
Helen demanded.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Because Agent 
Chilton had just reported in and wasn't due
to call in for another 
two hours.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Let me tell 
you this right now, Daria is not dead and we
will do everything we 
can to make sure she stays that way.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;How can you 
be so sure?&quot; Jake Morgendorffer shouted.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Because 
she doesn't fit the victim profile,&quot; Sarah
said calmly. 
&quot;There's some other motive behind kidnapping
her, and it's not 
murder.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Look I admit, we got caught with our 
pants down on this
one, but we will find her.&quot; I pulled a card 
out of my pocket
and handed it to Helen. &quot;Here's my cell phone 
number, call
me whenever you want I'll be sure to give you the latest 
update.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Thank-you.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's the 
least I can do. I'm sorry, I should have taken
more steps to ensure 
her safety, we just didn't think he'd 
do
this.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Just find Daria Agent Fraser,&quot; 
Jane said simply.<BR>
<BR>
I nodded, &quot;You can count on it. Now 
if you'll excuse us we
have an investigation to run. Plus we have to 
tell Tom's parents
that their son is in the hands of a 
sociopath.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Do you want their address?&quot; 
Helen asked me.<BR>
<BR>
I produced a Palm Pilot from another pocket, 
&quot;Tom Sloane
right? We've got the 
address.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Okay, I will be calling you every hour 
for updates.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm sure you will. Don't worry, it 
might not look like it
now, but we are the best at what we do. We'll 
get her back safe
and sound.&quot; Sarah and I said our good byes and 
left the way
we came.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well that went better than I 
expected,&quot; Sarah commented.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;At least nobody 
punched me.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I know, that's what I meant.&quot; 
Sarah smiled briefly,
&quot;Now we get to tell the Sloanes, 
right?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I nodded somberly, &quot;Yeah.&quot; I lashed 
out and punched
a nearby fence. &quot;Damnit! Why didn't we have a 
full detail
covering her?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You know the answer to 
that as well as I do,&quot; Sarah
said gently.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah, 
we didn't think the threat was credible,&quot; I 
grumbled
darkly.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Come on Steve, you know we can't 
always be right. I want
to nail this son of a bitch as much as you 
do, but you can't beat
yourself up over this. Focus you bastard, 
isn't that what you're
always telling me?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I took a 
deep breath, &quot;Yeah, you're right, let's go kick
some 
ass.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;After we talk to the 
Sloanes.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&lt;Tuesday, 
Unknown, 6:32pm&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Consciousness stole back slowly to my 
head. I groaned and tried
to figure out just where the hell I was. I 
was in what looked
like an office ofsome sort. Aside from some 
fuzziness in my head
I felt ok. At least until I tried to stand up. 
My ankles were
tied together and when I tried to free myself I 
realized my hand
were tied behind my back.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Great, not 
only do I not know where I am, but I can't move
and I don't even 
remember how I got here.&quot; I struggled against
the bindings a 
little before giving up. Not that I was an expert
in bindings but it 
felt like my wrists were bound with plastic
ties. I raised my head 
and saw my feet were tied together in a
similar 
fashion.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Wonderful, what the fuck happened? Jane, this 
isn't funny,&quot;
I shouted hopefully. &quot;Tom? Quinn? 
Anybody?&quot; There was
no response. 
&quot;Damn.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Shouting didn't seem to be getting me 
anywhere so I tried to take
stock of the situation. The lights were 
off, but there was enough
fading sunlight shining through a window to 
see by. The room was
small and looked like an office of some sort, 
just not furnished.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Okay, so I have no clue where 
this is, and of course there
aren't any phones in 
here.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I sighed and thought back to the last thing I 
could remember,
&quot;Let's see, Tom and I were in the park...&quot; 
I looked
around the empty room and sighed. &quot;So now I guess I've 
been
kidnapped, and assuming I haven't inadvertently offended a 
Mafia
don, the guy who killed Brian is the person who did it.&quot;
I 
muttered to myself. &quot;Looks like Agent Fraser was right,
damn 
him.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Just then the door opened and a figure walked 
into the room. &quot;Ahh
good, you're awake. I'm sorry I had to keep 
you under for so long,
but it was necessary to ensure you'd arrive 
here safe and sound.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Who the hell are you and 
where's Tom?&quot; I said angrily.
The man looked familiar, but I 
couldn't remember where I had seen
him before.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;My name 
isn't important right now, as for your...friend.
He is resting 
comfortably, awaiting his punishment.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You 
twisted son of a bitch, don't you dare hurt Tom.&quot;
My mind was 
racing, I knew I'd seen this guy recently, but I couldn't
remember 
where.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh, I won't touch him, that's your 
job.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What?&quot; I shouted, &quot;Why the fuck 
do you think I'd
want to hurt Tom? You're crazier than I 
thought.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm not crazy!&quot; The man shouted. 
&quot;That's just
a lie the FBI is telling people to hide the 
truth.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You slaughter innocent boys, what else 
could you be but
crazy?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm doing my job!&quot; 
he raged. &quot;They got what they
deserved. No one understands 
that...except for you.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Me?&quot; I asked, 
incredulously.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yes, watch.&quot; He took a remote out 
of his pocket and
pressed a button. A monitor built into the wall 
flared to life.
I saw myself, looking at Brian's corpse. &quot;You 
didn't scream,
that was how I knew you were special.&quot; He pushed 
another
button and the scene changed to a shot of Mr. O'Neill's 
classroom.
I was chastising Kevin for some reason. &quot;You're not 
fooled
by them, just like me we have a baond, and you are going to 
help
me.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;A bond with you?&quot; I said 
incredulously. &quot;If I
have a bond with anyone it's with Brian, 
the poor boy you killed.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But you and Brian had 
nothing in common. He thought you
were a loser, an outcast, and 
undesirable.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Maybe, but I'd agree with all of 
that. And I certainly don't
understand why you think he had to 
die.&quot; I realized it was
incredibly dumb of me to be arguing with 
a sociopath, but if he
was arguing with me he wasn't hurting Tom. 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You're just saying that because one of them has 
blinded
you.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Who Tom? What are you talking 
about?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;He's one of 
them.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;One of who?&quot; I asked. &quot;Oh god, 
if he thinks Tom
resembles the other people he's killed...this is not 
good,&quot;
I thought. The panic and fear were starting to paralyze 
my mind.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The pretty boys.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The 
what?&quot; I asked, dumbfounded. &quot;What the hell
is a pretty 
boy?&quot; I wondered inwardly.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The pretty boys, the 
people who think they can slip through
life like a bunch of girls, 
just because they're popular and think
they're good looking. They 
don't have any dedication, or commitment
to the good of the whole, 
all they care about are themselves,
and for that they have to be 
punished.&quot; What scared me the
most wasn't what he said, but how 
he said it. He never raised
his voice, it always remained level and 
rational sounding. What
he said was pure insanity, but the way he 
said it you'd think
he was talking about the weather. 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And before you ask, I know who the pretty boys are 
because
I was one myself, at least until my father punished 
me.&quot;
He rolled up his sleeves to reveal an ugly series of scars 
running
up and down his forearms. &quot;But father couldn't finish 
punishing
me because mother took me away. She said he was wrong, that 
he
was a bad man, but I knew better. He was just doing what was 
best
for me. Sometimes that's the hardest road to take. Which is 
why
parents today are too scared to discipline the pretty boys 
properly.
So I'm doing it for them.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;By killing 
them? I don't think that, in fact I think you're
insane, and a 
monster.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
He waved a hand, &quot;That...thing who oozed 
into your life was
just feeding you lies, deep down you know the 
truth, and soon
I'll reveal it to you. Until them I have preparations 
to make
so you should just go back to sleep.&quot; He pulled a 
syringe
out of his pocket and jabbed me in the arm with it. The 
world
started to spin, then turn gray, then nothing...<BR>
<BR>
&lt;Tuesday, Lawndale PD, Conference Room A, 6:42 PM&gt; <BR>
<BR>
 
I tapped a videotape on the table as people spoke around me. A
large 
TV was set up on the other end of the room. On it the a
videotape of 
Lawndale High's student parking lot was playing.
I watched Daria and 
her boyfriend get in a car and drive off.
It felt like the hundredth 
time I'd watched the clip. There was
something about it that was 
important, but I couldn't think of
what. I looked at the timeline of 
events in front of me, something
didn't seem 
right.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ok, what was the time of death on 
Chilton?&quot; I asked
the group.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Chilton checked in 
shortly after two. He died sometime shortly
thereafter,&quot; 
Pemberton answered.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And Daria left the school 
when?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;According to the friend, about the same 
time.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What are you getting at Steve?&quot; Sarah 
asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;How did the killer know where to find her? The 
time between
her speech and the abduction is too small for him to 
have seen
it on TV, tracked her down, killed Chilton, and then 
kidnapped
her.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So the killer was at the 
assembly, and followed her from
the school,&quot; Grisman 
offered.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sounds good, did anyone other than Daria 
Morgendorffer,
Tom Sloane, or Jane Lane leave the gym during the 
assembly?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Pemberton looked down at his notes, 
&quot;Uh, nobody unaccounted
for, just a couple of reporters who 
tried to talk to Morgendorffer.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So it was 
someone else inside the school,&quot; Sarah mused.
&quot;Wait a 
second, so that means the killer didn't hear Daria
admit to finding 
the body, how did he know?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Damn,&quot; I swore, 
&quot;I didn't think of that. Are we
sure the killer kidnapped 
them?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The evidence suggests it,&quot; Grisman 
said, &quot;Boot
impressions taken from around Chilton's body match 
ones we know
are from the killer. Agent Chilton was killed from by a 
single
stab wound to the neck, the wound is consistent with the 
other
victims. The forensics say the person who killed Chilton was 
the
same height and weight as the our offender. It's either an 
amazing
coincidence or the same person.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So how 
did he know?&quot; I asked, it was maddening, dead
end after dead 
end.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We had Quantico make a computer model of the 
crime scene
like you asked to check for potential lines of sight, and 
we found
something.&quot; Agent Lewis 
said.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The model pointed us 
to a hilltop not too far away from
the murder site. From there you 
have a clear view of the body's
position. We checked out the hilltop 
and found a few things, a
few faint boot impressions, some garbage, 
and this.&quot; Lewis
took a picture out of a folder and slid it down 
to me. <BR>
<BR>
I examined the picture, it was a shot of grass with 
three holed
punched into the turf. &quot;What am I looking 
at?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We weren't too sure at first, but when we 
were measuring
the depth of the holes...well actually, it was one of 
the 
local's
idea.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Extend 
lines up from the holes, you get a tripod.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Like 
for a camera?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Lewis nodded, &quot;Like for a camera, 
Quantico is crunching numbers
right now to get some dimensions, and 
they're comparing the holes
to as many different brands of tripods as 
they can.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Good job, send a commendation to the 
local, and an invite
to the FBI if he wants it, he sounds too bright 
to languish in
suburbia...it is a 'he' 
right?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well...no,&quot; Lewis 
admitted.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Even better, the Bureau always needs more 
women, am I right?&quot;
The table chuckled dutifully. &quot;Anything 
else on the hill,
like something to link it to the 
killer?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;One partial boot print, a heel actually, 
but it matches
the murder site.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The hairs on the back 
of my neck started to rise. &quot;It wasn't
a still camera, he wanted 
to record the whole event,&quot; I said.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You think 
that's his trophy?&quot; Sarah asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It makes sense, 
he's staging the kills, and then records
people's reaction to finding 
them. A still camera might miss something
after 
all.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But video catches everything,&quot; Sarah 
agreed.<BR>
<BR>
I glanced over at the TV still playing the 
surveillance tape.
&quot;Video tapes everything...Videotape, that's 
it! Who installed
the surveillance system at the schools?&quot; 
Papers started shuffling
as everyone searched for the 
information.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Uh, Scheps Video, Scheps Video, 
Scheps...&quot; Grisman
looked up from his notes. &quot;Boss, it's 
the same company with
all of the schools, Scheps Video 
Services.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The agents were already scrambling for the 
door when I started
to give orders. &quot;I want all their employee 
information. Find
out who worked on all the installation jobs, and 
move!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I stared at the tape case for a moment, 
&quot;That's how the fucker
picked them...the tapes...&quot; An 
overheard conversation from
the previous day flashed through my head. 
Now I might not have
a fancy degree in forensic psychology, but I've 
spent enough time
trying to outguess the guy on the other end of a 
gun that I can
get into people's minds if I try. And I can put to and 
two together.
I stood up and ran for the door.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Steve? 
What is it?&quot; Sarah asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I know who the killer 
is,&quot; I replied.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What, who, 
how?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I talked to him yesterday,&quot; I said as 
evenly as I could.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You what?&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There's no time to get into that, we've got to 
go.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Where?&quot; Sarah asked, following me out 
of the room.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Downstairs, to get an address of 
course.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ah yes, of course,&quot; Sarah said as 
we jogged down the
hall towards the stairs.<BR>
<BR>
&lt;Tuesday, 
Elsewhere, 10:13 PM&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I returned to consciousness for the 
second time that night thanks
to an incessant poking in my ribs. I 
groggily opened my eyes and
tried to focus on the blur floating above 
me.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Let's go Daria,&quot; my kidnapper said, 
&quot;There's work
to be done.&quot; He reached down to pick me up. I 
tried to struggle,
but my body wasn't listening to my brain. He 
unceremoniously dumped
me over his shoulder and we left the office. 
He carried me down
a hallway into a much larger room. In my altered 
state I couldn't
tell quite what the function of the room was, but it 
seemed big.
I was set down on a table with great 
care.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Here, I don't think you need those restraints 
anymore,&quot;
I saw a very large knife appear and cut the plastic 
bindings holding
my arms and legs. &quot;Now, are you ready to see 
the truth Daria?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Is there popcorn?&quot; I 
mumbled.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Here is your truth,&quot; He spun me around 
and I saw Tom
lying bound to a table. His clothes had been removed 
except for
his boxers and a rag stuffed into his mouth. &quot;Let's 
see what
this pretty boy has to say.&quot; The man sneered as he 
walked
over to Tom and yanked off the gag. &quot;Wake up pretty 
boy,
time to get your just deserts.&quot; He slapped 
Tom.<BR>
<BR>
Tom's eyes opened and he looked at our kidnapper, 
&quot;Look,
my parents are very rich, whatever you want they'll pay 
it,&quot;
he shouted. He turned his head and saw me, &quot;God, 
Daria, are
you ok?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;M'fine,&quot; I 
mumbled.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You see Daria, how it is, he only cares about 
himself, did
you hear how he started out begging for his own life, 
while your
first words were about him?&quot; He walked over to me, 
&quot;You
see that,&quot; he whispered in my ear, &quot;he doesn't 
care
about you, all he cares about is himself. You understand 
that
now don't you? You see why I did what I did. I know I've 
done
wrong, but what I did needed to be done. You'll help me 
explain
that to everyone else, right?&quot; Even in my drug induced 
haze
I could hear the shift in his voice from supreme confidence 
to
uncertainty. &quot;You will help me do what has to be done 
won't
you Daria?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I dimly looked at this man, someone I 
knew had horribly murdered
people. Then at Tom, who would surely be 
the next to die regardless
of what I said. If I agreed with the nut 
I'd probably live at
least a little while longer, if I didn't I was 
dead, that much
I could figure out. I shook my head to try and clear 
the cobwebs
out, it was hard to think with all that fuzz in my mind. 
Still,
the answer was clear, &quot;Mister, fuck off. You're insane, 
a
monster, there's no way on earth I'd ever do anything to 
help
someone like you, except to help fill your 
grave.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
He reacted like I had slapped him in the face. 
&quot;I guess I
was wrong about you, you don't understand. He must 
have poisoned
you more deeply than I thought. Very well, if you won't 
reject
him you'll share his fate. It's really only a minor 
complication.&quot;
He reached out to grab me.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You 
twisted fucker!&quot; Tom shouted, &quot;don't you dare
hurt 
her.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I tried to run, but just like in the park my feet 
were rooted
to the ground. &quot;Oh, that's fear,&quot; I thought 
distractedly,
as the killer grabbed me by the shoulder. His knife 
held high,
ready to strike. &quot;Well, this is it,&quot; I thought 
&quot;What
a shitty life,&quot; I looked over at Tom, &quot;Well, it 
wasn't
all shitty, too bad I couldn't say goodbye to Jane.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
Suddenly the world exploded in a blinding flash of light 
and sound.
The killer let me go and I stumbled backwards, tripping 
over my
feet. My head connected with something and I felt the world 
start
to fade away, &quot;Great, just call me the blackout 
queen,&quot;
I thought as Tom's shouting faded away to 
nothingness.<BR>
<BR>
&lt;Tuesday, Residence of Julian Riggins, 
8:20pm&gt;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Agent Fraser,&quot; Detective Secor called 
out, &quot;We're
ready.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's great,&quot; I 
muttered to myself, &quot;Next time
use your radio, I think there 
were some people around the block
who didn't hear you.&quot; I looked 
over at Sarah and sighed,
&quot;I hate doing this shit with locals, 
they're just asking
to get their asses kicked in.&quot; We had gotten 
the home address
of Julian Riggins and Sarah and I were about to 
search the house
with the help of Lawndale's finest. Agent Lewis was 
with another
group of Lawndale police searching Scheps Video, while 
the rest
of my agents were still at the police station gathering 
information
on our new suspect.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Easy Steve, they 
aren't supposed to be an A-team. Just go
do your job,&quot; Sarah 
told me gently.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah yeah, I know, still working with 
amateurs is a recipe
for trouble.&quot; We had traded in our suits 
for bullet-proof
vests and FBI windbreakers, the situation didn't 
call for the
ninja gear, not yet at least. I keyed my radio, &quot;Ok 
people,
let's do this thing. Remember stay low, eyes open.&quot; I 
stood
up from behind the hedge I'd been hiding behind and motioned 
for
the police to follow me. I cautiously made my way up to the 
front
door, my Sig Sauer at the ready. <BR>
<BR>
No bullets met me at 
the door and I signaled to the officer with
the battering ram to 
knock down the door. The burly cop took a
deep breath then swung the 
ram at the door. I dove through the
empty space before the door hit 
the ground. The room was dark,
but there was no sign of trouble. I 
waved the police in and we
started to search the house. The remainder 
of the building was
quiet, and empty. I sighed and relaxed a 
little.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;House is secure, subject is not, I repeat not, 
in the house.
We're clear, send in the evidence team.&quot; I 
switched off the
radio and walked out of the house, ripping the ear 
piece of the
radio out in frustration as I went. <BR>
<BR>
Sarah met 
me on the lawn. &quot;Sorry Steve, he should have 
been
here.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hopefully we'll find something in 
there that tells us where
he is.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A cell phone rang, 
Sarah reached into her jacket pocket, withdrew
a phone and answered, 
&quot;This is Raines, yes, he's right in
front of me, ok.&quot; She 
handed me the phone, &quot;It's Grisman.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I took the 
phone, &quot;Fraser here, talk to me 
Grisman.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Some good news, there was only one 
employee of Scheps Video
who worked on all seven of the installs. 
Care to guess who?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Julian 
Riggins.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's the guy. Pemberton is calling 
the other principals
to see if Riggins visited them as 
well.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I heard a commotion from the house and turned to 
see what it was.
Lawndale cops were hauling boxes out of the house. 
Detective Secor
held something up. &quot;We found tapes Agent 
Fraser.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Grisman they found tapes in the house. 
Riggins is now officially
the prime suspect.&quot; It felt good to 
finally have a name and
face to work with. &quot;Let Sorenstam know 
he's going to have
some more work to do. What else have you found out 
about him?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Not much yet, just 
vitals.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Keep digging, Raines and I are heading 
back to the station,
keep me informed.&quot; I closed the line and 
handed the phone
back to Sarah.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Back to the police 
station eh?&quot; Sarah asked.<BR>
<BR>
I shrugged, &quot;Not much to 
do here, he didn't commit the murders
in the house, and he's got the 
murder weapons with him. We can
be closer to the flow of information 
at the station.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Come on, let's take at least one 
pass through the house,
I want to get the feel of the place.&quot; 
Sarah said. &quot;Might
as well since we're here.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I 
shrugged, &quot;Fine, you win. It beats sitting by the phone
I 
guess.&quot; I followed Sarah into the house. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hey 
Detective Secor, need a couple extra pair of hands?&quot;
Sarah 
asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Always, we haven't started on that study over 
there.&quot;
The detective pointed down a hallway.<BR>
<BR>
As Sarah 
and I walked to the room we passed a large picture of
a man in Marine 
dress blues mounted on the wall opposite a door
leading into a 
bedroom. &quot;Think that' sour guy?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I shook my head, 
&quot;No looks different, besides that's a Vietnam
service ribbon, 
and Riggins is too young to have one of 
those.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh, so it's his father 
then?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I nodded, &quot;Good bet, quite a prominent 
picture don't you
think? You come out of that bedroom over there and 
there it is.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You think there are paternal 
issues? He's killing trying
to get approval?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I 
shrugged, &quot;Could be, we'll figure that out eventually,
I 
hope.&quot; We continued on to the study.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Very 
organized,&quot; Sarah commented as she took in 
the
study.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Let's fix that,&quot; I said snapping on my 
rubber gloves
for emphasis.<BR>
<BR>
There are several ways to 
perform a good search of a room, the
neat way and the 
trash-the-ever-living-shit-out-of-the-room-way.
We chose the latter, 
not so much for expediency's sake, but to
simply extract some small 
measure of vengeance on the fucker who'd
already screwed with so many 
people's lives. Sure, it was petty,
but what the hell, he'd never see 
the house again.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hey Steve, take a look at this,&quot; 
Sarah said.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What is it?&quot; I asked while I turned 
over another box
of documents.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's a 
deed.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;To this place?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No, to 
a small office complex called the McCardell Building
in a town called 
Richmond.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Bingo, that's where he is, he took 
them out of town, where
we wouldn't expect him to go. He'll probably 
dump the bodies and
make it look like they killed themselves to throw 
the locals off
the scent and buy him some time to 
disappear.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Are you sure about all 
that?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sure enough to know that's where he's 
headed. Besides, it's
a lead isn't it?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;True so, 
how do you want to handle it?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We do what we do 
best, investigate,&quot; Ireplied wryly.
&quot;Hey, Detective 
Secor!&quot; I shouted. Secor came into the
room shortly 
thereafter.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Find something Agent 
Fraser?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I nodded, &quot;Agent Raines did actually, a 
deed to some property
in a town called Richmond, know where that 
is?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
He nodded, &quot;It's about 100 miles away, I can 
show you on
a map if you want.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Thanks that'd be 
very helpful.&quot; We all walked out to
the rental car. I took a map 
out of the glove compartment and
Detective Secor circled the town on 
the map.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So you think the killer is in Richmond?&quot; 
Secor asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's a safe bet,&quot; I 
replied.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Think you'll need a hand taking him 
out?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I think Richmond's out of your jurisdiction 
Detective Secor,&quot;
I answered lightly. &quot;Besides you can do 
more good staying
here and keeping up the search of the house.&quot; 
I held out
my hand, &quot;Thanks for all your assistance Detective 
Secor.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
He shook my outstretched hand, &quot;Thanks for 
helping us catch
the bastard Agent Fraser.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We 
haven't caught him yet detective.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well, when you 
do give him a couple pops for me.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You bet 
detective,&quot; I replied confidently. Secor walked
back into the 
house.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Police brutality, fun,&quot; Sarah said sourly. 
She had
spent the early part of her career investigating dirty cops, 
and
had a low tolerance for police malfeasance because of 
it.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hey, lay off, his heart's in the right 
place.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's just as well the killer ran to a 
neutral site, it'll
make the arrest 
easier.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Speaking of which, toss me your 
phone.&quot; Sarah did so
and I dialed Grisman's number. 
&quot;Grisman, it's Fraser, we
got a hit, it looks like Riggins 
bolted to a town called Richmond.
I want you to get on the phone to 
the local police there, explain
the situation to them. As soon as I 
hang up I'll fax over a deed
to where we think Riggins is. Have the 
locals place the building
under surveillance, but not to approach the 
building until Agent
Raines and myself get there. Did you get all 
that?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Richmond, deed, local PD, you and Raines, 
got it,&quot;
Grisman replied.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;One more thing, call up 
the Richmond hall of records and
get the floor plan of the building, 
then fax it to me.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sure thing 
boss.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Thanks a lot Grisman.&quot; I closed the 
phone and gave
it back to Sarah. &quot;Mind faxing that deed over to 
Grisman,
he's expecting it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Steve, what are you 
planning?&quot; Sarah asked as she set
up the mobile 
fax.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We're going to investigate the lead,&quot; I 
replied as
I opened the trunk of the car and took a duffel bag out. I 
opened
up the passenger side door and tossed the keys to Sarah. 
&quot;You
drive.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Sarah stared at me, the suspicion 
evident in her eyes. &quot;Why?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Because I need 
to work the phones,&quot; I replied coolly.
&quot;Now hand me the fax 
and get the car going, we are under
a bit of a time crunch after 
all.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Sarah sighed and started the car. As we drove off 
I opened up
the duffel, took my gun cleaning kit out of the bag and 
started
cleaning my pistol.<BR>
<BR>
&lt;Tuesday, McCardell Building, 
9:47pm&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Julian Riggins wiped the sweat from his brow. 
He'd been working
on getting the cafeteria ready for the grand show 
for the past
several hours. All the chairs were now carefully stacked 
along
one wall and the center of the room was clear of any 
obstacles.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's fitting,&quot; he thought, &quot;that 
mother's ultimate
betrayal of father ends up helping insure his 
vision lives on.&quot;
He chuckled, &quot;Oh you silly bitch, you 
tried to keep father's
pension out of my hands by buying this stupid 
building, too bad
you died before you could change your will.&quot; 
Riggins laughed
quietly to himself, that had been fun, not only had 
the bitch
deserved to die, but it had proven to him that he could make 
his
father proud, and punish the pretty boys.<BR>
<BR>
Riggins 
carefully examined the cafeteria, everything was set,
now he just 
needed to get the other two actors in his little play.
&quot;I'll 
start with the boy,&quot; he thought. &quot;There's
no reason to wake 
Daria until after he's been prepared.&quot;
Riggins walked down the 
hall to the office he'd placed the boy
in.<BR>
<BR>
Riggins opened 
the door and peeked inside the room. Tom was more
or less where he'd 
left him. Riggins hadn't bothered talking to
him so far. He didn't 
want to lose his temper and do something
rash, something that was 
liable to happen if he did talk to Tom.
<BR>
<BR>
Tom heard Riggins 
enter the room. &quot;Who the hell are you and
what do you want with 
us?&quot; He yelled.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm here to prepare you for your 
punishment,&quot; Riggins
answered calmly.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Punishment? 
What the fuck are you talking about? And where's
Daria? If you've 
hurt her you'll regret it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Riggins ignored Tom. 
Instead he took a pair of scissors out of
the utility pouch he wore. 
He leaned over Tom, who started to
squirm. &quot;I'd recommend 
keeping still, I'd hate to cut your
before I have to.&quot; Tom 
stiffened, allowing Riggins to cut
off Tom's 
clothes.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That wasn't so bad now was it?&quot; Now, to 
make sure you
keep quiet...&quot; Riggins took a strip of cloth from 
the floor
and wrapped it around Tom's mouth. He picked Tom up and 
carried
him into the cafeteria. Riggins dropped Tom onto a table in 
the
center of the room.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Now I'm going to cut these 
bands so I can tie you to the
table, don't try anything or I'll kill 
you, then the girl, ok?&quot;
He told Tom while waving his knife in 
front of him. Tom vigorously
nodded his understanding. Riggins cut 
Tom's arms free, then rebound
them so they were secured to the table. 
He repeated the process
with Tom's legs.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There you go, 
all set. Now all we need is Daria and we can
begin.&quot; Riggins 
left Tom on the table and walked out of 
the
cafeteria.<BR>
<BR>
&lt;Tuesday, Airborne over State Highway 40, 
9:34 PM&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Sarah and I were sitting in the back of a 
borrowed State Police
helicopter. We were almost to the Richmond 
Police's command post
outside of the McCardell Building. I was 
staring at the floor
plan handed to me before we'd gotten on the 
helicopter. Sara was
holding onto her seat, helicopter travel, 
especially high speed,
low altitude flights, have never agreed with 
her. As a veteran
of countless nap of the earth flights I didn't even 
notice.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Steve why a damn helicopter?&quot; She asked 
over the intercom.<BR>
<BR>
I looked over at my friend and smiled 
sadly, &quot;Sorry Sarah,
but this is the quickest way to get to 
Richmond, and you did insist
on coming with 
me.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's because you've got that damn ninja 
bag with you.
I'm here to make sure you don't do something 
stupid.<BR>
<BR>
I keep all my infiltration gear in one duffel which 
Sarah calls
my ninja bag. It's the sort of thing that comes out when 
the shit
hits the fan. &quot;It's very simple, who would you rather 
have
going in there, someone trained in covert ops and 
infiltration,
or a bunch of hick cops who don't even know what covert 
means?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;At least you could wait for the HRT to 
arrive on the scene,&quot;
she paused, &quot;but that will take too 
long, wont it?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I nodded, 
&quot;Exactly.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The pilot's voice came crackling over 
the intercom, &quot;We're
approaching the landing point thought you'd 
like to know.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I folded the plans up and placed them in 
my bag. Memories of other
night time helicopter rides into an 
unknown, hostile situation
flashed through my head. &quot;At least 
nobody will be shooting
at me when we land,&quot; I muttered as I 
checked the holstered
Colt .45 at my side, a parting gift from the 
Green Berets.<BR>
<BR>
The pilots must have been ex-military because 
he executed a perfect
&quot;Hot LZ&quot;-style landing. Sarah and I 
hopped out of the
helicopter and started running towards a cluster of 
police cars.
I waved to the pilot who waved back then flew 
off.<BR>
<BR>
We were met by an officer halfway to the police cars, 
&quot;Hello,
I'm Walter Malloy, chief of police here in 
Richmond,&quot; He
looked like your stereotypical Irish 
cop.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Nice to meet you chief, I'm Special Agent Steve 
Fraser and
this is my partner, Special Agent Sarah Raines.&quot; We 
all shook
hands.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Your Agent Grisman was a little vague 
on the details of
what's going on, mind filling me 
in?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sure thing chief, why don't we gather your 
people and I
can tell you all what's going 
on.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;If you insist, follow me, we've got a little 
command post
set up.&quot; He lead us over to the police cars. There 
they had
set up a small table with an electric lamp providing 
illumination.
&quot;Ok guys,&quot; the chief called out. &quot;These 
are the
FBI agents who are going to explain to us what we're doing 
out
here.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I stepped towards the center of the little 
ring. &quot;Hello,
I'm Agent Fraser, that's Agent Raines. I'll be 
brief. You've all
heard of the murder over in 
Lawndale?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The serial killer, right?&quot; one of 
the cops asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yes, the serial killer. We have reason 
to believe that he
is in that building over there.&quot; I pointed at 
the dim outline
of the McCardell building. &quot;And that he is 
holding two teenagers
captive.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But that's 
impossible, Mr. Riggins is in there, I'm sure
he'd call us if there 
was someone else in his building,&quot;
the chief protested. I fixed 
Malloy with a steady gaze. He caught
on quickly, &quot;You don't mean 
that Mr. Riggins is this 
serial
killer?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Chief,&quot; Sarah broke in 
gently, &quot;The evidence overwhelmingly
supports that theory. His 
travel plans match the killings, we've
found evidence that he's 
stalked the victims, and he's a physical
match. It's not an airtight 
case yet, but there are too many coincidences
for us to 
overlook.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Malloy nodded, &quot;I've been there before, 
still, I have a hard
time believe that Mr. Riggins is this monster, 
he's such a hard
working man. He's been renovating that building 
himself ever since
his mother died eight months 
ago.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
My eyebrows raised involuntarily, &quot;Oh 
really.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yes, she died quite suddenly in 
fact.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;When we're done here I'll want to look at 
all the information
you have on her death.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You 
think he killed his own mother?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I shrugged, &quot;All 
I know for certain is that there aren't
pictures of anyone who might 
be his mother in his house. Suggests
he had issues with her, beyond 
that it's all speculation.&quot;
I took the floor plans out of my 
bag. &quot;Now let's get down
to business, shall we? You're saying 
that Riggins is definitely
in the 
building?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yes,&quot; Malloy answered, &quot;His 
van is in the parking
lot.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ok, great, now a 
Hostage Rescue Team is on its way here,
they should arrive in another 
thirty to forty minutes. They'll
go into the building and clear it 
out.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What do you need us to do?&quot; Malloy 
asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Deploy your men around the building, 
discretely, keep anyone
from entering or exiting. Can you also get an 
ambulance or two
on site, just in case?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sure, 
sirens off 
right?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Exactly.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So what do 
we do until the rest of you feds show up, just
sit here and do 
nothing?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I want you and Agent Raines to get 
everything ready on this
end, I'll going into the building gather 
intelligence on the situation
inside.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Are you 
sure that's such a good idea Agent Fraser? I mean
shouldn't we be 
calling Mr. Riggins or something?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This isn't a 
hostage situation Chief, Riggins is a dangerous
sociopath, he'll kill 
the kids as soon as he knows we're here.
Agent Raines and myself are 
positive he intends to kill one of
the captives, but we aren't sure 
what he's planning to do with
the other. In fact it's a good bet he's 
already killed one or
both of them. That's what I'm going to find 
out.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;How?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Quite simple 
really, I'll break into the lobby then climb
into this air duct 
here.&quot; I pointed to a spot on the map.
&quot;Once in the vent 
system it should be easy to move through
the building without being 
noticed. I'll sweep the floors, report
what I find, then wait for 
backup. Agent Raines has a radio so
we can keep in 
contact.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
On cue Sarah's cell phone began chirping, 
&quot;Excuse me while
I take this call.&quot; She walked off a short 
distance and answered
her phone.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't know Agent 
Fraser, seems like a pretty hare-brained
scheme to 
me.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It does to me too&quot; I answered wryly, 
&quot;But we need
the intelligence and I can't think of a better way 
with the tools
we have, unless you happen to have some infrared 
imaging gear.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's on the budget for next 
year,&quot; he offered lamely.<BR>
<BR>
Sarah walked back over to us 
and handed me the phone. &quot;It's
AD Schoenweis, he wants to talk 
to you Steve.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I sighed, &quot;Ok,&quot; I took the 
phone, &quot;Assistant Director
Schoenweis, how are you 
sir?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Agent Fraser, what's this I hear about you 
planning to play
commando?&quot; The AD asked in his booming 
voice.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sir, we've tracked the man we believe is 
responsible for
the killings in Lawndale, we know he's got two teens 
captive,
one of whom is the girl who found the body of the initial 
victim,
and we know they're now inside an office building he 
apparently
owns. There's an HRT on the way but we need to know what's 
going
on inside the building. As the ranking agent on scene I feel 
going
into the building for some reconnaissance would best help 
the
HRT do its job.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
There was silence on the other end 
of the line, &quot;How soon
until the HRT 
arrives?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;About a half-hour 
sir.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
There was another long pause, &quot;Ok Agent 
Fraser, go in. But
Steve, just observe, we don't need you playing 
hero.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I wasn't planning on it sir, the only 
heroes I know are
dead ones.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Good man, and good 
luck,&quot; Schoenweis hung up.<BR>
<BR>
I tossed the phone back to 
Sarah, &quot;It's a go,&quot; I said
simply. I opened up my duffel 
and started taking out my gear,
bulletproof vest, a pair of night 
vision goggles, all the things
you'd expect a well equipped commando 
to have. I pulled on my
gear and inserted a fresh clip into my 
silenced MP-5 sub-machinegun.
I adjusted the whisper mic on my radio, 
&quot;Ok, let's get this
show on the road. I'll radio once I'm inside 
the building.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Good luck Agent Fraser,&quot; 
Chief Malloy told me.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Thanks 
Chief.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hey Steve, be careful ok, I've just 
gotten used to you,
I'd hate to have to break in a new partner 
now.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You're assuming something bad is going to 
happen, to me,
which isn't going to happen because Riggins will never 
even know
I'm there.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Still, be 
careful.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I always am.&quot; I said before 
dashing towards the McCardell
building, keeping low and staying 
quiet.<BR>
<BR>
When I arrived at the front door I carefully looked 
for any alarms
or cameras. It looked like Riggins hadn't gotten 
around to wiring
the door so I reached for a thermite charge. The 
door opened easily
with the lock burned out and I slipped into the 
building.<BR>
<BR>
The interior of the building was dark, but that 
didn't matter
to me. I crept towards where the air vent was marked on 
the map.
Fortunately the layout of the building hadn't changed much 
and
the vest was where it was supposed to be. The cover was 
easily
unscrewed and I crawled inside. The interior of the vent was 
a
tight fit, but I'd been in tighter places 
before.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Base, this is Point,&quot; I whispered into 
the radio.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This is Base, go ahead,&quot; Sarah 
replied.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm in the vents, no problems yet, I'll let 
you know more
then there's more to tell, Point out.&quot; I switched 
off the
radio and started to crawl through the vents.<BR>
<BR>
It 
wasn't easy going but I'd managed to work my way up several
floors of 
the building before finding signs of life. Or more 
specifically,
light.<BR>
<BR>
I toggled my radio, &quot;Base, Point, 
possible contact on the
third floor, investigating.&quot; I crept 
towards the source of
the faint glow. I peered out of the vent and 
found myself staring
at a dimly lit cafeteria. There was no sign of 
Daria or Riggins
but I did see Tom Sloane lying tied to a table. 
&quot;Base, Point,
contact, I repeat contact. Objective Two is still 
alive, I repeat
Objective Two is still alive. No sign of Objective 
One or the
Subject. I'm going to try and get closer.&quot; There 
hadn't been
time to think up fancy codenames, but my military 
background refused
to let me refer to them by their real 
names.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Careful Steve,&quot; Sarah cautioned me, 
&quot;You don't
know where Riggins is.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ok, 
direct me to a location with a better field of 
view.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You're over the 
cafeteria?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yes.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There's a 
kitchen and serving station abutting the cafeteria,
you should see it 
from where you are.&quot; I looked and sure
enough there it was, a 
dark recess in the far wall of the cafeteria.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That'll 
do nicely, now how do I get there?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What do you 
think doofus. Get out of that shaft and shag
ass over 
there.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This isn't the time for jokes 
Base.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Alright, follow the branch you're on, then 
turn right, there's
a vent in the 
kitchen.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Thank-you,&quot; I followed the 
directions Sarah had given
me until I came to another vent. Looking 
out of it I saw a kitchen.
The vent grill came off easily and I 
slipped into the kitchen.
I crept towards the opening into the main 
cafeteria. Crouching
behind the counter facing the cafeteria I raised 
my head to get
a good view of the cafeteria. I counted on the dark 
backdrop of
the kitchen to obscure me from anyone looking around the 
cafeteria.
Shortly thereafter the door to the cafeteria banged open. 
I watched
as Riggins carried Daria into the room and dropped her on a 
table.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Base, Point,&quot; I whispered, &quot;Subject 
and Objective
One just entered the room. She doesn't look hurt, just 
out of
it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Steve, do not 
engage.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm not about to, but tell the cavalry 
to hurry their asses
up.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Reinforcements are five 
minutes out Steve, hold tight.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I double-clicked the 
radio in acknowledgement and watched an obviously
disoriented Daria 
argue with Riggins. &quot;Base, Point, the situation's
deteriorating, 
just thought you'd like to know.&quot; Riggins
seemed to be growing 
more agitated as he spoke to Daria.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh shit,&quot; I 
muttered as Riggins grabbed Daria and drew
his knife. &quot;Base, 
Point, the Subject has a knife and is threatening
One. I'm 
engaging.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I grabbed a flash-bang from my belt and 
tossed it at Riggins.
The grenade detonated with a loud bang causing 
Riggins to let
go of Daria. I was on my feet and running towards the 
center of
the room before the sound has dissipated. &quot;This is the 
FBI,
drop the knife and step back!&quot; I shouted.<BR>
<BR>
Riggins 
ignored me and dove for Tom, knife raise. I squeezed the
trigger 
once, firing a short burst which caught Riggins square
in the chest. 
The impact of the bullets staggered him and he went
down. I ran over 
to the prone killer and kicked the knife away
from his 
hand.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Base, Point the situation is under control, 
Subject is neutralized
and both objectives are unharmed. I need 
paramedics for Riggins
though. He took three rounds to the chest, so 
tell them to hurry.&quot;
I looked down at Riggins, &quot;Julian 
Riggins you're under arrest
for the murder of Agent Emil Crawford, 
Brian Wiltson and others.&quot;
I bandaged Riggins's wounds with some 
field dressing I was carrying,
but I didn't hold out much hope he'd 
ever be prosecuted. Looking
around the room I saw Daria lying 
motionless on the floor. I ran
to her side and took a pulse, which 
was strong to my relief.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hey, how's Daria?&quot; Tom 
Sloane asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;She's fine, unconscious, but 
fine.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Great, now could you please untie 
me?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sure thing kid, then we'll find you some 
pants while we're
at it. My name's Agent Fraser by the way,&quot; I 
said calmly
as the paramedics came bursting through the 
door.<BR>
<BR>
&lt;Wednesday, Lawndale Memorial Hospital, 
9:00AM&gt;<BR>
<BR>
What finally got me up was the sunlight shining 
on my face. I
woke with a start thanks to a subconscious memory of 
the last
place I remembered being at. I settled back to sleep when I 
realized
I was lying in a bed, only to get another jolt when I 
realized
it wasn't my bed. I slowly opened my eyes and cautiously 
looked
around, only to see a lot of fuzz, I wasn't wearing my 
glasses.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Damn,&quot; I said aloud, &quot;Where are my 
glasses?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Here you go Daria,&quot; Quinn said 
from outside my line
of sight.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Quinn? Where the hell 
am I?&quot; I asked as I looked around.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You're in the 
hospital Daria. Agent Fraser had them bring
you straight here from 
Richmond.&quot; A fuzzy pink blob came
into view and handed me 
something. I grabbed my glasses and put
them on. The blob resolved 
itself back into my sister. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ok, so I'm in the 
hospital, why, and where's Tom?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They brought you 
in for observation because of all the drugs
in your system and 
because you have a low-grade concussion. Tom's
down the hall for 
observation too.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Mom and 
Dad?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Getting coffee, Jane's in the lobby by the 
way.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And you're here 
because?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It gets me out of school, 
d'uh.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Right, of course,&quot; What did I expect? 
That's what I
would've said if our roles were 
reversed.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And because I was worried about you Daria, 
for a moment
I thought I was going to be an only child, and while 
that would've
helped my popularity, it would've also meant that Mom 
and Dad
would try to spend more time with me and stuff, and that's 
like
the last thing I want right now.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I smirked, 
&quot;I'm touched, I really am.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Don't get all 
mushy on me.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I was going to say the same to 
you.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Quinn's retort was cut off my Mom and Dad's 
arrival. &quot;Daria,
you're awake!&quot; Dad 
shouted.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Of course she's awake, the doctor said she 
was just sleeping
off the drugs she'd been given, it's not like she 
was in a coma.
But it is good to see you awake sweetie, especially 
since you've
got that bump on your head.&quot; They both rushed the 
bed and
hugged me.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oxygen fading, loosing 
consciousness,&quot; I said haltingly.
It was the second time they'd 
hugged me in under a week week.
I couldn't deal with that much 
physical contact.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So, how are you feeling kiddo?&quot; 
Dad asked hesitantly.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;My head feels like an elephant 
stepped on it,&quot; I answered
truthfully. &quot;Where's Jane?&quot; 
I asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'll go get her,&quot; Quinn replied, picking 
up on the
hint and ducking out of the room.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Daria, we 
were so worried about you. When we first heard
what happened from the 
FBI...I thought we'd lost you,&quot; Mom
said as she sat beside me on 
the bed, her hand firmly gripping
my shoulder.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I was 
pretty sure I'd lost myself too.&quot; I tried to
think back on 
everything that had happened the previous day. &quot;I'm
a little 
fuzzy on the details after the assembly. But I remember
enough to 
know it wasn't pleasant.&quot; Images of Tom lying strapped
to a 
table floated through my head.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well look at that, 
Sleeping Beauty's awake,&quot; Jane said
as she walked into the 
room.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hey, I didn't get a bit of sleep all night. You 
should know
that Jane, I spent most of the night talking to you...oh, 
right
you were talking to Daria...I'll, uh, be out in the lounge 
taking
a nap.&quot; Quinn slunk out the door.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You 
spent the night talking to Quinn? About 
what?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;How her hair keeps it 
bouncity-bounce,&quot; Jane replied
evenly.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Wow, and I 
thought I was the one drugged by a 
homicidal
sociopath.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah, about that, how are 
you feeling?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I shrugged, &quot;I'm still alive, so I 
guess I can't complain.
Why do you ask?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Beyond 
friendly concern?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Of 
course,&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I want to know if the time's right to 
kill you for standing
me up yesterday. I ran all the hell over town 
looking for you
and Tom.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sorry Jane, a madman 
had other plans for Tom and myself.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So I 
gathered, it's good to see you in one piece, because
otherwise, well, 
you know.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; I agreed. I didn't want to 
think about how close
I'd come to death. &quot;I just wish I knew 
what the hell happened
after I blacked out. I remember him drawing a 
knife, then there
was an explosion, and that's 
it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I can answer that,&quot; Agent Fraser said 
from the doorway.
I turned and see him and Agent Raines enter the 
room.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;How are you feeling Daria?&quot; Agent Raines 
asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'd feel better if people stopped asking me 
that question,&quot;
I answered drolly.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No 
doubt,&quot; Agent Fraser commented, chuckling. &quot;The
case is 
effectively closed so I figured you'd like to hear what
we we've 
found out.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah, I'd like to know what kind of 
crazy son of a bitch
would want to hurt my daughter,&quot; Dad said 
indignantly.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well, here's what we know, mixed in with 
some conjecture.
The man's name was Julian Riggins. He was in his 
mid-thirties.
His father was a Marine Gunnery Sergeant who was 
serving in Vietnam
when Riggins was born. His mother seems to have 
basically been
your standard career housewife. We don't know all the 
details,
but when Riggins was twelve his mother divorced the father 
then
married a man named McCardell and moved to Richmond. The 
divorce
papers don't outright say so, but it appears that Gunny 
Riggins
liked to beat on his wife and son.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's what he said,&quot; I 
mused.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What's that?&quot; Agent Raines 
asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's one of the things I remember, he came into 
the room
I was in and we talked. He rambled about 'pretty boys' and 
how
his father disciplined him for being one, and that's what he 
was
doing...&quot; I trailed off, I didn't want to mention the 
rest
of the conversation we had.<BR>
<BR>
Fraser nodded, &quot;That 
makes sense. Among the other things
Gunnery Sergeant Riggins came 
home with was a face full of shrapnel
courtesy of the NVA at Khe 
Sanh. It ended a two year tour of duty
in Vietnam for the sergeant. 
After Vietnam he was a drill sergeant
and according to his service 
record an unholy terror to his boots.
It sounds like Sergeant Riggins 
took his work home with him. Sergeant
Riggins died in a training 
accident shortly after the divorce
and the ex-wife received the 
pension, which she invested in the
real estate market, including an 
office building. Also thanks
to some court documents we've found it 
looks like either the mother
or step-father abused the teenaged 
Riggins.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why would they do that?&quot; Mom 
asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Who knows, but Riggins was placed in the foster 
care system
on several occasions. We'll know more when we get the 
records
opened. But Mrs. McCardell's medical records show that due 
to
complications in Julian Riggins' birth she was infertile. So 
there
was probably resentment on the part of either the mother or 
the
step father that Julian, this reminder of the mother's 
traumatic
past, was their only child.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why don't 
you just ask his mother?&quot; I asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Because she's 
dead. She died eight months ago. Oddly enough
shortly after her 
husband died. If I had to guess I'd say that
Riggins killed her to 
keep her from changing who inherited her
real estate holdings. That's 
probably what triggered the killings.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So, you're 
saying the killer was a psychopath because his
father was an abusive, 
domineering soldier?&quot; Dad asked hesitantly.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;In 
part yes,&quot; Agent Fraser said guardedly, &quot;But
that's not an 
excuse for his actions, just because you've suffered
trauma in your 
youth you can't let it control your life to 
that
extent.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; Dad said 
hesitantly.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Agent Fraser, would you mind explaining to 
me what that
guy wanted with me, and why I'm not 
dead.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Fraser shrugged, &quot;You probably know the 
answer to your first
question better than I do since you talked to 
him.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I stared at a random spot on the wall, &quot;He 
said I understood
why he was killing those boys because I didn't 
scream when I found
Brian's body. But that's not true, I didn't 
scream because I was
too shocked to react.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's 
ok Daria,&quot; Agent Raines said, &quot;Riggins was
trying to reach 
out to people through the killings, that always
has been a component 
of his pathology. For whatever reason he
thought you were a person he 
could confide in. He probably create
an idealized version of you that 
fit his needs and was divorced
from who you really are. There's 
nothing about you that's abnormal
Daria, it was him, you were just in 
the wrong place at the wrong
time. It could have happened to anyone, 
even your sister.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I felt a smirk play across my face. 
&quot;Well, if you insist.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I do,&quot; Agent 
Raines said in her soft, yet forceful
voice.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But that 
doesn't answer my other question, how did I end
up 
here?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;For that you can thank the commando 
standing next to me,&quot;
Agent Rains said, pointing at Agent 
Fraser.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yes, in an attempt to get intelligence on what 
was going
on inside the building Riggins was holding you I 
infiltrated the
structure and located your position. While I was 
observing events,
and waiting for the hostage rescue team to arrive, 
Riggins threatened
your life, something I'm sure you remember. I 
engaged Riggins
and neutralized him. Paramedics arrived on the scene 
and I ordered
you and Tom to be flown back to Lawndale for 
treatment.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I remember an explosion, what was 
that?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;A flash-bang, a grenade used to distract 
and disorientate
the opposition.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What happened 
to Riggins?&quot; Mom asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;He died on the operating 
table,&quot; Agent Fraser said
flatly. &quot;Which means that Daria 
doesn't have to worry about
any court 
dates.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Should I feel good about that?&quot; I 
asked dubiously.<BR>
<BR>
Agent Fraser shook his head, &quot;You 
don't have to feel anything,
Riggins was about to kill you. If anyone 
has to worry about the
consequences of Riggins' death it's me since I 
killed him. I can
live with trading you and Tom for him. Don't let it 
worry you.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So does this mean I have to something 
special with my life?&quot;
I asked.<BR>
<BR>
Agent Fraser laughed, 
&quot;No, just live your life, don't feel
like you have to do 
something extraordinary on my account.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's a 
relief, I don't think I could handle that sort
of 
pressure.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Thank you both so much for getting 
Daria back safe and sound.&quot;
Mom said. &quot;I don't know what I 
would have done if something
had happened to 
her.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We were just doing our jobs Mrs. 
Morgendorffer.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Still, 
thank-you.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hey Daria, look who I found roaming 
the halls,&quot; Quinn
said as she walkedback into the 
room.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;How many times have I told you Quinn, no 
strays.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Think you can make an exception for 
me?&quot; Tom asked,
walking into the room. He was wearing a pair of 
pants over his
hospital gown. There was a nasty looking bruise on the 
right side
of his face.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Tom! I'd get up to say hi, but 
you know,&quot; I indicated
the flimsy hospital gown I was 
wearing.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's ok, you don't have to get up.&quot; He 
walked over
to the bed and hugged me. &quot;Damn Daria, it's good to 
see you
again.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You too, especially since you've 
found some pants.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Tom chuckled, &quot;Yeah, that was 
pretty inconvenient.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No pants?&quot; Mom asked, 
horrified.<BR>
<BR>
Riggins had Tom stripped down to his boxers when 
I found him,&quot;
Agent Fraser said. &quot;Which is curious since he 
usually killed
his victims while they were 
nude.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Maybe he didn't want to corrupt my 
delicate eyes,&quot;
I offered.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Could 
be.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Say, Agent Fraser, are they still saying 
that Brian was
gay?&quot; I asked.<BR>
<BR>
Agent Fraser sighed, 
&quot;People are pretty much ignoring the
meat of what you said and 
are focusing on the drama of you finding
the body, and subsequent 
disappearance.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh,&quot; I said, disappointed, 
&quot;So I didn't do any
good, and I let that lunatic know who I 
was.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Raines shook her head. &quot;He already knew who 
you were Daria.
Julian Riggins worked for the company that installed 
Lawndale
High's new video surveillance system. He made copies of the 
class
rosters and the tapes from the class rooms and used those to 
figure
out your name.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That explains those videos 
he showed me, but I still didn't
accomplish anything with my 
speech.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I wouldn't say that,&quot; Raines said. 
&quot;You spoke
out against something that bothered you. And there 
were some people
who listened to you, it's just that not everyone 
did. So what
you did wasn't a bad thing, and it wasn't a mistake, 
just keep
that in mind.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;At some point I'm going 
to want to sit you and Tom down
and get statements from both of you. 
Not right now though. The
case is over, but we like to fill in the 
blanks for the case file,&quot;
Agent Fraser told 
us.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Uh, sure,&quot; I replied, not really listening, 
I'd been
exposed to too much information in too short a period of 
time.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We'll also do our best to shield you from the 
press, but
you'll probably want to at least temporarily hire some 
press handlers
and maybe give an interview or two just to satiate 
them. Otherwise
things might get a little 
disruptive.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You mean more than they already 
are?&quot; I asked drolly.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;My dad's firm has a few PR 
people, I'm sure they can help
out,&quot; Tom 
offered.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Speaking of which, where are your 
parents?&quot; I asked
Tom.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Outside, I said I wanted a 
few minutes, er, alone with you,&quot;
Tom looked around the crowded 
room. &quot;But they do want to
say hi.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Jane, it 
seems, picked up on the hint. &quot;Hey, why don't we
give these two 
a moment alone?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's not really 
necessary...&quot; I started to say.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Nonsense Daria, 
if you want to talk to Tom in private that's
certainly your 
right,&quot; Mom said brightly. &quot;Come on Jake,
let's go talk to 
the Sloanes about those interviews.&quot; She
grabbed Dad by the arm 
and started to drag him out of the room.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Don't worry 
kiddo, you'll be home in no time,&quot; Dad
said encouragingly before 
he was hauled out of the room.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hey Quinn, let's go see 
if Elsie wants to form a new all
girl version of the Three 
Musketeers, or failing that an updated
Charlie's Angels,&quot; Jane 
told my sister.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ooh, who'd be Charlie?&quot; Quinn 
asked as they walked
out of the room.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Talk to you real 
soon Daria, and believe me, you oweme
big time for this 
Morgendorffer,&quot; Jane said over her shoulder.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I 
guess we should be going too,&quot; Agent Raines said
as she walked 
over and hugged both Tom and myself. &quot;Take
care you 
two.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You going to be alright Daria?&quot; Agent 
Fraser asked
me.<BR>
<BR>
I looked over at Tom, then at the door, 
&quot;Yeah, I will be.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Great, and Tom, keep an 
eye on Daria for me. The US Government
has invested a lot of money in 
her continued existence, I'd hate
to see it go to 
waste.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Tom chuckled, &quot;I think Daria can pretty 
well take care of
herself, but I'll do my 
best.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Alright then, be good you two and enjoy 
your lives.&quot;
Fraser turned to leave.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hey, Agent 
Fraser?&quot; I called 
out.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Thanks, for 
everything, saving my life most of all, but
the other stuff 
too.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No thanks necessary, it's just all part of 
the job, but
you're welcome,&quot; he said before the two agents 
walked out
of the room.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So...&quot; I said, &quot;What 
did you want to talk to me
about?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Daria, last 
night, when Riggins tried to get you to kill
me, and let me add thank 
you for not doing that.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Inwardly I winced, the fact 
that someone else thought I was capable
of that, no matter how 
deranged he was, disturbed me. &quot;Yeah,
what about 
it?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;He said I didn't care about you, that I was 
only interested
in saving myself...that's not true. I do care about 
you, in fact
I would've done whatever it took to have gotten your out 
of there
unharmed.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Good thing for both of us you 
just had to lie there,&quot;
I said lightly, trying to break the 
mood.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm serious Daria, your 
safety...&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Was foremost in your mind, yeah, I 
know.&quot; I said cutting
him off, &quot;Do you know how silly that 
sounds?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
He shrugged, &quot;It's still 
true.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I sighed, 
&quot;Damn.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What?&quot; Tom 
asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh, I just don't know how I'm going to pay Jane 
back, first
she's my friend, then there's you, and now she's gotten 
both our
siblings out of our hair.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Tom laughed, 
&quot;We'll have to thank up something good,&quot;
he said before 
leaning over and kissing me, and for the first
time since Saturday 
life started to look 
up.<BR>

Sarah and I walked out of the 
hospital, gave the press there a
perfunctory statement and headed for 
the rental car.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So, what are you going to do now that 
you're Mr. Big Hero
Guy?&quot; Sarah asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well first 
I'm going to head back to DC to give a press
conference to tell the 
news jackals to lay off the Morgendorffers
and 
Sloanes.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Oh really?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yep, 
and I'll also be sure to play down my role in the case,
like any good 
FBI agent would.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But of 
course.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
We got into the car. &quot;After that, I think 
I'll take a vacation.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You don't 
say.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah, I've got a lot of time saved up and I 
think I've earned
a nice long break.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Damn 
straight you have, where are you planning on 
going?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Anywhere but suburbia, I don't know, 
maybe I'll just drive
around in search of the American Dream. Just 
take a break from
serial killers and the 
like.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sounds like fun, want a travel 
buddy?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I looked over at Sarah in surprise, &quot;You 
serious? I'd think
seeing me at work would be 
enough.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Sarah shook her head, &quot;I think we need to 
get to know each
other a little better in a non-professional 
setting.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Who am I to refuse a hot woman inviting 
herself along on my trip?
&quot;Sure, I don't see a problem with 
that.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Sarah stared out the window a moment. &quot;You 
really think that
Daria and Tom will be alright?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I 
shrugged, &quot;Sure, they're young, they've got their family
and 
friends. They'll be fine.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm glad this one went 
well,&quot; Sarah said after another
long pause. &quot;Makes it all 
worth it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I nodded, &quot;Yes, it does.&quot; It meant 
we could leave Lawndale
with a win, and a bit of good feeling in the 
bank to help us with
the next case waiting for us, the next Riggins 
just biding his
time. I sighed, &quot;The job never ends does it 
Sarah?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
She shook her head, &quot;No it doesn't but we 
won this time Steve.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah, we did,&quot; I 
looked out of the car, at the rows
of identical houses, each one a 
proclamation of normalcy and stability,
all of them looking like the 
house Riggins lived in. &quot;God
I hate the suburbs,&quot; I said 
finally as we drove out of town.<BR>

Author's 
Notes:<BR>
So ends The Stone and it's troubled six month development. 
I wrote
the intro sometime in January then put it down to work on 
some
other stuff, and then picked it back up again when I 
finished
Song that Jane Likes, mostly for a change of pace. Little 
did
I know that it would become the most involved work I've ever 
written.
I'd like to say up front that I consider this to be a failed 
experiment.
I was going for a certain mood, and I don't think I 
accomplished
that task fully. However there's something to be said 
for failure,
and at around 90 pages I just was not going to throw 
this failure
out. I'm of the opinion that this is a very good story, 
just not
quite the one I set out to write. I do have just a few brief 
comments
about the development of the piece, and a few other areas, 
to
wrap up any loose ends.<BR>
<BR>
Origins: I'm a fan of the 
X-Files, and of Thomas Harris. The Stone
came about because of my 
admiration of these sources, in particular
two pieces of X-Files 
fan-fic, Oklahoma and Corpse. The Stone
is, in many ways, a stylistic 
descendent of Corpse, and shares
a great many plot elements. I highly 
recommend checking out both
of these fine novels since they are every 
bit as good as any commercial
psychological thriller. And actually, 
were it not for the brilliant
writing of Mr. John Takis and his novel 
&quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot;
I probably would have written The 
Stone as an X-Files crossover.
However, with the bar raised so high I 
decided not to attempt
the jump and instead created the characters of 
Fraser and Raines.
<BR>
<BR>
Veracity: There are elements of this 
story that are not realistic.
This is not a 100% realistic story, 
obviously. In the creation
of the FBI agents I took a few dramatic 
liberties with how the
FBI really would operate in a case like this, 
however since the
story is an homage to stories about the fictional 
FBI I didn't
feel troubled with taking similar liberties in my own 
work. Besides,
Investigative Support Unit sounds much better than 
National Center
for the Analysis of Violent Crime (NCAVC), or Child 
Abduction
and Serial Murder Investigative Resources Center (CASMIRC), 
the
names of the departments the ISU has been rolled into. 
<BR>
<BR>
The Killer: Yes, Julian Riggins did turn out to be 
something of
a cross between Jake Morgendorffer and Francis 
Dolarhyde, the
killer in Thomas Harris's &quot;Red Dragon.&quot; It 
was not an
intentional decision. Instead it simply flowed from the 
crime.
I sat down and tried to determine just how this killer 
picked
his victims and why. The pieces then fell into place from 
there.
I was planning on including a Harris-esque interlude in 
which
the Riggins' childhood was more closely examined, however I 
decided
against the segment since this is still a Daria fan-fic, and 
not
a novel about a serial killer.<BR>
<BR>
The FBI: Yes, this story 
certainly does spend a lot of time away
from the cast of Daria. I was 
a little hesitant about this decision,
however, one of the key 
elements of the story Corpse, my inspiration
for this work, was the 
concept of the outsider looking in on the
characters we all know. In 
order to achieve that same effect in
The Stone I had to break apart 
the narrator character of Corpse
into two, Fraser and Daria. I hope 
my little indulgence in extreme
author-created character development 
can be forgiven. :)<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for reading this 
&quot;little&quot; work, it was a lot
of fun to write and despite my 
pessimism I do think it's a good
story. Also big thanks to everyone 
who alpha/beta read for me,
it was a big help folks.<BR>
