<p class=MsoNormal>I walked through the front door of my former home for the
first time in months, my bag of clothes and necessities slung over my shoulder,
and sighed in relief.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My first
semester at Raft was behind me, and I was glad of it; it had taken more of a
toll than I had expected, for both personal reasons and academic ones, and
having survived it relatively intact felt like a rite of passage.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finals had been grueling - for the first
time in my life I had actually had to study, in order to ensure I made it
through the freshman weed-out classes with flying colors - and I felt drained
from the experience, even with the weight now off of my back.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had never thought to be so relieved
to see the inside of these familiar walls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was no one waiting to greet me, which I was a little
surprised at; I had not been home since the beginning of the semester, having
stayed in Boston over Thanksgiving to catch up on all my assignments before
beginning finals, and was I no more missed than this?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't believe I was actually wishing to hear Quinn's
prattling or my father's ranting, but four months away from everything familiar
will induce some strange cravings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The person I missed the most was Jane, of course, but I didn't think I
could expect her home quite yet; her trip with her father would probably last
until she absolutely had to be back, if not a little bit longer.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not from any parental bond reluctant to
let her go, but simply because her father probably would not bother to make his
way back to Lawndale until necessity demanded it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Even then, I was half-expecting Jane to show up right before
classes with a tale of skipping out on her father and hitching rides on rail
and road night and day to get to Boston in time.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Either way, I doubted I would see her until January.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Until then, it was just my family and
myself, with no distractions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>God
help me, what have I gotten myself into?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From where I stood, the house looked unchanged.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no reason it should not be,
but so much had happened to me in the past few months, so many little and
not-so-little ways in which my outlook had changed, that it seemed the
surroundings I had so closely associated with my old life should have changed
to reflect it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My view had
broadened, my horizons had expanded, or I was at least working to make it so;
shouldn't I be seeing everything with new eyes, finding new details in what had
once been old?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But everything
looked as bland and suburban as ever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>No new eyes here, it would appear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I started to take my bag upstairs to my room, but then Quinn
emerged from her own domain and walked down, conversation into the cell phone
pressed to her ear never missing a beat as she made her way into the den.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>". . . well of <i>course</i><span style='font-style:normal'>
Sandi looked great in those shoes I mean she's got great ankles even though her
legs are a bit too thin to pull of some of the heels she wears and oh hi Daria
and I really think that some of those would look </span><i>much</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> cuter on someone with better calves well </span><i>thank</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> you Tiffany I've always thought that I had good
calves . . ."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A wave and a perfunctory greeting was all that I got out of
Quinn as she breezed past me towards the kitchen, no doubt going to check on
some low-fat chips or maybe carrot sticks.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>My own stomach rumbled, and shrugging my bag off onto the
couch, I followed her in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I placed
a couple of sugar tarts into the toaster as she rummaged around the veggie bin
of the refrigerator.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Seeing the
paper lying on the table, evidence of my father's former presence, I picked up
the arts section and, retrieving my snack, settled in for a quiet read.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was lost in reading about the new Gary's Gallery location
opening in one of the ritzier sections of Lawndale, so as to make it easier for
the rich and tasteless to purchase artistic credibility, and being inevitably
reminded of Jane, when Quinn finally switched off the phone and joined me with
a plate of celery stalks and low-fat dressing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm sorry, Daria," she said, and she sounded as if she
actually meant it, "I didn't mean to ignore you like that.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to say hi and talk and
everything, but I couldn't get rid of Tiffany."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Because we all know what a chatterbox Tiffany Blum-Deckler
can be." I had actually been looking forward to seeing her, and was a bit
annoyed at having to play second fiddle to her sluggish friend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I really do want to talk, Daria," she continued.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I mean, it's been months since I've
even seen you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mom and Dad weren't
very happy when you decided to skip out on Thanksgiving."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I glared at Quinn, letting her know
that the guilt trip was not welcome.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I had heard enough when I had told Mom about my decision.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The truth was, I had needed time for my
schoolwork, but I had also just wanted to be alone, to sort out some questions
about my life, and I didn't feel like subjecting myself to family at the
time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But the time away had
worn more heavily on me than I had imagined, and now I found myself welcoming
my sister's company.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So, how was college, Daria?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Just like school," I replied, "but with less Kevin.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'd say that alone made it a positive
experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Plus, some of the
professors actually know what they are talking about."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A slight understatement, that; Raft was
one of the finest non-Ivy League schools on the East Coast, and any comparison
to the teachers I had at Lawndale High was laughable.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The sensation of actually being challenged at school was new
to me, and a pleasant one, though I was still adjusting to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Did you meet any cute guys?" Quinn asked, inevitably.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I know it's a brain school and all,
but they can't all be that bad, and you've got to have met someone who works
for you by now."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quinn was eager
to hear my response, but I definitely did <i>not</i><span style='font-style:
normal'> want to discuss this particular topic, not with her, not yet.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>James was still a sore spot on my
conscience, and while I was sure that Quinn would be sympathetic, I didn't want
to dredge it all up for her enthusiastic scrutiny.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Actually, I'm already married," I replied.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I was going to save the news for a
Christmas surprise, but my enthusiasm is running over and I can no longer
contain my happiness."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I kept my
voice as flat as possible, and Quinn got the message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Okay, no boys then.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Do you do anything outside of classes?"<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Quinn was starting to sound desperate.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I guessed that she had been waiting for
this conversation, a chance to catch up with her sister and get a glimpse into
the world she would be entering next year, and thanks to her unwitting blunders,
I was giving her very little to work with. <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>I sighed internally, and resolved to try to be a bit more
open, within reason that is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, I do things outside of class.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I read and listen to music.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I watch TV.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I surf the web.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I think about things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
lead a very rich and fulfilling life."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It sounded like sarcasm, and in a way it was, but it was also true, a
very good summation of my life beyond school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
know what I meant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Do you do
anything with people?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You haven't
made any friends there at all?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Quinn sounded surprised, and I was surprised myself at the apparent
confidence she had in me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Had she
assumed that making new friends would be that easy for me once I hit college?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, Quinn," I replied, and was dismayed to have to say it,
the only answer I felt I honestly could.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"I haven't really made any friends yet."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>True, in a way, but very far from the whole truth; I had
done things, once.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I've been
rather busy, with schoolwork."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Gah, Daria, is that all college is, just studying?" Quinn
was horrified.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No doubt she was
starting to rethink her own application to Pepperhill in the light of this
dreadful new information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, it's not," I reassured her.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"There are lots of other things that students do, just not
me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm sure you'll have plenty of
time for fun at Pepperhill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You can
even skip the boring parties if you want.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There's even parties as Raft; I just haven't felt like going."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You should try," she urged.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"This is your chance to have fun, Daria.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If all of those other smart people
there can find things to do, can't you do it with them?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>See, brains can have fun too."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I knew that she was trying to be
sisterly and nice, but this conversation had reached the limit of what I could
take in this particular direction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I would enjoy myself plenty in Boston once Jane was there with me, and
until then, I had devoted myself to more private pursuits; well-meaning as it
was, I didn't feel like listening to a lecture from Quinn.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had obviously been spending too
much time alone with Mom; they were starting to sound alike.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At least there was still one person in
this household on whom I could depend for a lecture-free conversation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Is Dad anywhere around, Quinn?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm not sure," she replied, looking disappointed in the
sudden change in topic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"He was
around when Mom was on the phone with Aunt Rita earlier, then he
disappeared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I thought he said
something about birds sleeping or something like that.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was weird, but then Tiffany called
and I forgot all about it."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I knew
where Dad had gone, and was tempted to join him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I had deduced, I found Dad in the garage, preparing it to
be his hideout away from the coming apocalypse.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He had cleared out a spot for a bed, and was dragging heavy

</span>When I walked in, he looked up and ran over to give me a hug; I was
uncomfortable for a second, but I quickly returned it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had missed him more than I had
realized.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hiya, kiddo," he said enthusiastically, and the endearment
did not sound as odious as it once had.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"So you're back from college now?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, Dad, this is just a holographic projection.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Help me, Obi Jake-enobi, you're my only
hope."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He blinked, but laughed
after a moment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That was a joke, wasn't it," he said, proud of his
achievement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"That was really
funny."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Thanks," I replied, and disengaged myself from his
arms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I walked around, surveying
the cluttered garage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There were
actually a lot of memories here, boxes filled with old books and games and
toys; I was tempted to start digging through to see what forgotten articles I
could find, maybe something to take back with me to Raft, but that was
something for later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"So I presume
the Joseph of the Barksdale family is coming for a visit?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is she bringing her Amazing Technicolor
Dreamcoat with her?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't think
we have the right kind of laundry detergent for it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Who's Joseph?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Is that Rita's new boyfriend or something?"<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Dad was confused, but he had learned long ago to put such
statements behind him quickly enough and go on with whatever he was
saying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Since the last time they
got together ended so well, your mother thought it would be a good idea to ask
Rita over for the holidays, to see if they could keep things going."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was shocked.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had assumed that Rita was involved
somehow, but had thought that she had invited herself over, like last
time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mom was certainly being
optimistic about the situation if she had initiated the whole thing.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What could have possibly given her that
idea?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, Dad concurred
with my opinion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"It's crazy, I
tell you, crazy!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There's no way
they can stay happy with each other for that long!<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I didn't want to wait around until the shit <i>really</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> hit the fan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>That shrink at the spa your mother took us to that one time told me I
should be more proactive, so here I am, taking control of my life before Helen
and Rita send it all to hell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
can be my contact, Daria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You can
smuggle me food and Christmas cookies, and let me know when it has all blown
over, just like last time."</span></p>

more open to people now, </i><span style='font-style:normal'>I thought.<span

that would include people like Rita, at least not yet, but it looks like it's
going to be trial by fire for me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class=MsoBodyText>So I guess it's up to me to supply the color
commentary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Am I still allowed to
do that?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just because I'm trying
to be less judgmental, does that mean I can't point out obvious idiocy when I
find it?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I have a feeling this
holiday is going to be very character building, and I mean that in the worst
way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So, whaddya say, kiddo?" Dad asked.<span

during Rita's visit?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He looked so

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sorry, Dad, you can't stay in here all Christmas.<span

I'm not feeling all that great and I'm just not up to it.<span

year; I'll get you twice as many presents."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm not going to help you," I replied with growing
frustration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I've missed you, and
I want to see you around during my break.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I promise, you can have all the martinis you want, and if the fighting
gets really bad, we'll go out for pizza or something."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He didn't look convinced.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was going to have to pull out the big
guns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I steeled myself for what
was sure to follow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Don't you
remember the year your father spent Christmas with his poker-playing army
buddies instead of at home?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Wasn't
he supposed to see you in that Christmas pageant that year?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah, that's right!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Goal accomplished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I was
playing a shepherd, and the whole time we were supposed to be tending sheep I
was searching the audience for him, but he never showed up!<span

he said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>'Men don't wear towels on
their heads and play make-believe'.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

actor, but did I ever get any?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Did
he show up for any of my performances?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>No!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Don't worry, Daria;
your dad won't let you down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
won't be like he was.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I won't let
Rita drive me away from being a great dad!"<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mom's voice lost the forced cheer it had held while
discussing her plans, and regained the irritation that had usually tinged it in
previous occasions when she was recounting her niece's activities.<span

disgusted at her own lapse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The four of us were sitting at the kitchen table, talking
over dinner - Dad's newest culinary experiment, some unholy combination of stir
fry and pasta that Dad was insisting we try eating with chopsticks - and Mom
was filling us in on the plans she and her sister had made for the
holidays.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The rest of us just sat
in horror, and it was an even toss whether the horror was greater over the news
or the meal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tomorrow was the day
before Christmas Eve, which meant that Mom and Rita would be trapped in the
same house for over a week; and if Mom couldn't even keep the bitterness out of
her voice for more than a few sentences . . .<span style="mso-spacerun:

Brian aren't going to bring us back any Vienna sausages; if you want them so
much, get them at the store yourself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

Year, so they can't make it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Amy

<p class=MsoNormal>Which, of course, was the heart of my own dilemma.<span

come?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I could tell Quinn was
trying to ride that fine line between challenge and placation.<span

still sniped, but it was more old habit and mutual amusement than true
hostility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was willing to believe

on the couch beside me and went to greet the incoming disaster.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hi, Daria, Quinn," Rita said.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"I'm so sorry Erin and Brian couldn't come, Helen, but
they've still got several days left in Austria and getting an early flight back
would be so expensive . . ."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, no, I completely understand," Mom replied.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"After all, I know they don't have much
money and who knows when they might be able to afford it again.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I wouldn't ask them to waste so much of
<i>their</i><span style='font-style:normal'> hard-earned cash just to make a
Christmas visit to their relatives."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mom bit down on her bottom lip after that last line; the butter knife in
her hands, with which she had no doubt been slicing the dough, was spinning
through her fingers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just then,
Dad entered the room; his face paled as he sensed the already tightening
atmosphere.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, hi, Rita," he said nervously.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"Merry Christmas."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He seemed at a loss for what to say after that, so he just sat down on
the couch and fiddled with the TV remote.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mom looked more relieved than anything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Rita, Daria's in college now," Mom said.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Let the kid competition begin</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>, I thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"She just finished her first semester at Raft, with honors.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We're so proud of her."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That's great, Daria," Rita said, though she never once
looked at me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Brian just got a
new job, too, with one of the biggest real estate agencies in Charleston."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>And how's that raging case of herpes going?</i><span
style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But Mom
was having a hard enough time of it already, and I felt enough sympathy for her
not to say anything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I love what you've done with the place," Rita was
saying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"But where do you have
your tree?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That's the big surprise," Mom said.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Everyone turned to look at her in
confusion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We had always used the
same tree, an artificial one we had bought shortly after I was born, and had
always assembled and decorated it on Christmas Eve night.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rita had never been here on Christmas
before, so she couldn't have known, but what made it such a surprise?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I want us all," she continued, "to go out and chop down a
tree together, as a family activity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A new Morgendorffer-Barksdale tradition."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>A collective gasp of trepidation filled the air.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Ewww; a real, live tree?" Quinn wailed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"The sap will get all over my clothes
and in my hair and it won't wash out!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Mom," I said, "do you really want to hand an axe to any
member of this family?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All work
and no play makes Daria a dull boy."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"My father used to make me chop wood," Dad raved.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"'It builds muscles', he said.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>'It'll turn you into a man, instead of
some pansy-ass nancy boy'.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Well,
you know what, Dad?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've got a
real job now!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't need to chop
wood to survive!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I swore I would
never hold an axe again!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I took
the remote and switched the TV to the Pigskin Channel, and the screen filled
with a picture of a bunch of tiny men wearing plastic slamming into each other.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Hey, cool.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The game's on!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He settled in to watch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Um, Helen, are you sure that's a good idea?" Rita
asked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"We've never done anything
like that before."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"A little bit of togetherness is what this family needs,"
Mom declared confidently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Getting
our own tree will get us all in the holiday family spirit.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's not like I'm asking you to go
camping or anything."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Some of those berries might make the holidays go by
easier," I said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The only response
I got was the stare of death from Mom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The wind was icy, and the few pitiful trees remaining at the
Christmas tree farm did little to block its onslaught; my heavy jacket provided
a little protection, but my face still quickly became numb, even with my hood
up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no snow yet, but the
recent rains had left the ground muddy and half-frozen, and the effort it took
to trudge up and down hills with the earth underneath partially giving way with
every step soon left all of us short of breath and testy of mood.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It seemed an inordinate amount of work
to put in for the privilege of cutting down a stunted, warped evergreen that
had never done any harm to us, and then carting it back home to be grotesquely
festooned with garish decorations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And it wasn't making it any easier that Mom and Rita found it impossible
to agree on a single tree.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"And what's wrong with <i>this</i><span style='font-style:
normal'> one?" Mom was asking, while standing over a specimen of flora that
would have looked sickly next to Charlie Brown's tree.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was one of the better choices on the
lot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's too short, for one," Rita replied, "half its leaves
are gone, and its tip leans to the left."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"And you think the one you picked out was better?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Its base was all out of proportion to
its tip, and half of the needles were brown!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, maybe we would be able to find a tree we both like if
you were willing to pay for a better selection than this place has.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Last year, Mother bought us a gorgeous
tree; it was perfectly symmetrical and had a base big enough for all our
presents to fit under."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That's easy for her to do; she no longer has a family to
support with all that money, and it's not like she ever gives us any of
it."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She paused.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Look, Rita, I don't want to argue with
you about this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's Christmas,
and what's important is that we are together, not how perfect the tree
is."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I think I counted three
different shades of purple pass over Mom's face as she said this.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"If that last tree is the one you
really want, we'll get it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we turned around to head towards Rita's choice, Mom and
Rita plunged on ahead, and Dad fell into step beside me, while Quinn lagged
behind, muttering about the cold and chapped skin and freakin' mud on her shoes
or something, I wasn't really listening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"How ya holding up there, kiddo?" Dad asked with artificial
cheer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was sure he was as
miserable as I felt, though I didn't look directly at him to see.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'll be fine, as soon as Mom gives up on her Paul Bunyan
fantasy and lets us all celebrate the plastic, artificial Christmas we've
always had."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I looked at the large
saw Dad was carrying; actually, more like dragging with one end riding along the
ground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"You aren't actually
planning on using that thing, are you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You bet I am!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I'll chop that thing down in no time, you'll see.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'll prove my father wrong!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I can chop wood as good as any
man!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He would have gone on, but
his words were lost in heavy breathing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I turned to get my first good look at him since we arrived, and I was
taken aback by what I saw.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We were
all a bit strained by the walking, but he looked as though he had just hiked
ten miles; his breath was coming in gasps, his face was more pale than it
should have been in the cold, and he looked as though he was having to force
each step.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He was dragging the saw
half the time, and the rest of the time using it as a cane.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I almost tripped over my own feet in
shock.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Dad!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Are you feeling
alright?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sure, kiddo, never better.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm just a bit out of shape, that's all.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nothing to worry about."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He grinned widely, too widely to be
genuine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

been this way, but I was just too accustomed to him to notice.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He took us out camping just two years
ago; was he struggling this much then?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It's probably just stress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It looks pretty
lopsided.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm not sure being

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Helen, if you really don't want this tree," Rita snipped,

kids to do your dirty work for you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Not at all," Mom reassured her.<span style="mso-spacerun:

it down."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Why not?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If I
lose my legs, at least I won't have to walk back."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I reached through the branches and grabbed the trunk.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quinn did the same, but screwed up her
face as though her hand had landed on something truly grotesque, like a slug or
out-of-season shoes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's <i>sticky</i><span style='font-style:normal'>," she

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Watch out for the bugs, Quinn.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Ahhhhhhh!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Quinn shrieked and yanked her hand out of the branches; she jumped at
least a couple of feet back from the tree and slapped at her hand in a
panic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I smirked; at least I had
managed to get a little bit of entertainment out of this outing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Fine, Daria," Mom retaliated.<span style="mso-spacerun:

cuts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Use both hands; you don't
want to let it fall on him."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Wordlessly, I placed my other hand on the trunk and held it steady as
Dad sawed through the wood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since
it was a small tree, he only took a couple of minutes, and it was light enough
for the two of us to carry it together.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I did my best to watch him for signs of strain, but since he was ahead
of me, there wasn't much I could tell just by looking at his back; at least he
wasn't staggering or giving any obvious signs of wearing out.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>He's probably feeling pretty

<p class=MsoNormal>Late that afternoon, I lay on my bed facing the ceiling,
trying to distance myself from the dysfunction below.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Mom was trying, I had to give her that, trying to be
forgiving and tolerant, trying not to dredge up the bitterness of the past at
every reminder, but she was failing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She would hold her tongue as long as she could, bite down on her lip and
smile, but eventually Rita would say one thing too many about Erin and Brian or
their mother, and Mom would lose control and take a verbal swing back, and they
would be off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And, eventually,
since Mom was determined to make this holiday a time for family healing, she
would retreat again and return to her forced hospitality.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was attempting to deal with the
past by ignoring it, pretending it didn't matter, and it wasn't working.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And, in the meantime, Dad's martinis
were becoming a fixture in his hand, and Quinn simply watched in silent
horror.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And I had retreated to the
solace of my padded walls, my own private decorator's nightmare, which were feeling
more fitting with every passing moment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mom's efforts were uncomfortably reminiscent of my own
recent struggles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had spent the
last few months in near-solitude while reevaluating my view of the world, the
walls I had erected between myself and the rest of humanity, in the wake of the
destruction those walls had wreaked on my first new friend since Tom.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had considered the problem from all
angles, trying to ascertain how to maintain my principles without using them an
excuse to lock away the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
had evaluated my past relationships - familial, friendly, and romantic - to
break down what had made the difference between my acceptance and my rejection,
to spin my theories as to how to change my approach to make myself more
accessible, less rigidly isolationist, for my own sake as well as for the sake
of others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But what if those
theories didn't fit the facts?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>What if I couldn't just <i>accept,</i><span style='font-style:normal'>
merely by willing myself to do so?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mom was trying something similar, forcing herself to associate amicably
with her sister, and what was it getting her?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Repressed bitterness leading to even greater outbursts,
sabotaging whatever bridges she had built and traumatizing her family in the
process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And, being a lawyer,
where knowledge of how to manipulate people was more a requirement than just an
asset, Mom was far more inherently diplomatic than I.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If she couldn't bring herself to handle basic sibling
rivalry, what chance did I have of completely changing a lifetime's worth of
behavior?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But what choice did I have?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had realized what my thorns would
eventually cost me - every relationship I would ever have - and I could not
live with that high a price for their protection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The only relationship I had that gave me hope that matters
could improve was Quinn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Over the
past few years, we had moved from bitter rivals, viewing each other with
genuine suspicion and resentment, to more friendly opponents whose bickering
was more habit and mutual amusement than real conflict.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But how had that happened?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Did it start two summers ago, when
Quinn had finally realized that she could actually be comfortable with her own
brain, and so did not necessarily have to be ashamed of having a sister with
one?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Had it started with my own
act of mercy, holding back my most damaging piece of footage from that film
project for O'Neill?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Or was it
something more gradual, a slowly-increasing <i>d&eacute;tente</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> between us?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And if that was it, what could I learn from it, if it was so gradual and
natural that I hadn't even been conscious of it as it was happening, wasn't
even certain of what </span><i>had</i><span style='font-style:normal'>
happened?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>I wish Jane
were here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I always think better
when I can talk it through with her, and I'm certain she would have a few

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a knock on my door, and Quinn's voice called in,
wondering if I were here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Think of the devil and you see her T-shirt.</i><span
style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I'm
sorry, but the door you have called is not in service at this time.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please shut up and try again
later."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As I knew she would, she
opened the door and entered at the sound of my voice, long inured to the actual
contents of my speech.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria," she said hesitantly, "I was wondering if maybe you
would want to go see a movie or something tonight?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Are there none of the former Fashionistas around for you to
hang out with?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite the
question, I wasn't all that surprised by the request; in fact, I should have
been expecting it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No; Sandi's spending the holidays abroad, Stacy is visiting
relatives, and Tiffany . . . well, Tiffany just isn't worth hanging out with by
herself."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She looked embarrassed
at the confession.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"C'mon, Daria,
you aren't even reading or anything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Even you can't think that just sitting in here by yourself is fun."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had that right; staying in here
alone had not been at all fun, but I had thought that it was necessary.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And I needed to stay here a little
longer, to work out these new pieces of information, before I could subject
myself to the outside world yet again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Quinn, if this is about Mom and Rita's fighting, we've gone
through this before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You don't
have to worry about us . . ."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I know that," she interrupted.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"I mean, I <i>was</i><span style='font-style:normal'>
thinking about that, a little bit, but that wasn't all.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've </span><i>missed</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> you, Daria, really I have, and I haven't had the
chance to even talk to you since you first got home.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And I </span><i>don't</i><span style='font-style:normal'>
want us to end up like Dad and Uncle Esau, never talking to each other except
when we have to. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>I know that when
I go off to Pepperhill, I probably won't see anyone from high school much
anymore, but you'll still be my sister, and I don't want that to just mean that
we have the same eye color and slim calves.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Once you left, I felt like I had wasted seventeen years of
getting to know you, and just when I was starting to maybe understand you a
little bit, you were gone."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I stared at her; she appeared to be completely serious.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had realized these things myself, but
I had not expected her to see them so clearly.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I felt as though I were looking at a different Quinn than
the one I had left just four months before.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Had one little change in her life made such a big
difference?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Or had I just not
noticed it until now?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sure, I had
seen improvement even before I had left, but this was like a quantum leap
forward from how my memory painted her; she was still Quinn, but a more mature
version of the child I had thought that I had left behind.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe spending some time with her would
not be quite so strenuous after all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>So long as such time did not involve burning Georgian cities and lovable
rogues sweeping Southern Belles off their feet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Please, Daria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It's horrible down there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mom and Aunt Rita are acting like two supermodels having to share the
same runway, and Dad is drinking and yelling at the TV or his father.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I really want to get away, but I don't
feel like going alone."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That sparked a concern.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Quinn," I asked her, interrupting as soon as she took a
breath, "have you noticed Dad acting sick lately?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Tired, out of breath, that sort of thing?"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She went a little pale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You saw it too?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I tried to talk to him about it, but he said that he was fine.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mom was too wrapped up in her plans for
Rita to even listen to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What do
you think it is, Daria?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is Dad
really sick?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Do you think he might
. . . ?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She cut off in
mid-sentence with a choked sob, but I had a good idea of what she was going to
say.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to tell her that he
was going to be alright, to console both of us with meaningless platitudes and
reassurances.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But that was not my
way; I had learned a long time ago that, in the long run. it was better to face
reality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So I answered honestly,
as was my wont.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't know, Quinn."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The fear shone from her eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"It might be nothing important, just a touch of the flu or something
similar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Or it might be stress;
Dad's on the edge of breakdown at the best of times, and this business with
Rita isn't helping.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But it might
also be something serious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dad
hasn't really done much to improve his diet or his habits since his heart
attack, after all."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Not much that I can see."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Again, I wanted to paint a more positive picture, but I was
too familiar with our parents to believe in it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"Mom's too determined for this to work out to get rid of
Rita, and she's already making her best effort not to fight.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We can't force Dad to change his
attitude.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That has to come from
within."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>And I'm not even sure
how to change it from there.</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"The best we can do is run interference
between Dad and the Hatfield and McCoy sisters."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>Maybe I should have left him in the garage after
all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It couldn't have been a
permanent solution, but it might have kept him out of immediate danger.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Too late for that now, though.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mom would search him out if he
disappeared now; it would be just a little too obvious.</i><span

<p class=MsoNormal>"Never mind, Quinn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Anyway, it doesn't sound like there is very much that we can do for them
right now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If Dad's yelling at the
TV, at least he's not concentrating too much on Mom and Rita, and that's the
best that we can hope for.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe
it would be best for everyone if we did go out for that movie, on one
condition: I get to pick the film."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn and I spent most of the next day doing our best to
keep the tension level in the house, and especially in Dad, as low as
possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quinn, being the one
with more experience in dealing with competitive women, was working as a buffer
between Mom and Rita; reinterpreting their words to defuse the hidden barbs and
steering the conversation towards calming topics, along with interjecting some
suitably ingratiating comments to soothe egos and just generally keep them both
in a good mood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>From what I saw of
it, it was a performance that could have kept the Beatles together, and I stood
in grudging awe of her abilities; Mom and Rita were not eating out of her hand,
but neither were they at each other's throats, and that was all that we
required.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And even that was a
miracle; since we were not planning on decorating the tree until that night,
there was little to occupy their time, and the idleness weighed heavily on
their heads.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bickering was the
only amusement easily available.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the meantime, I had to deal with Dad, keep him calm and
away from the Barksdale sisters, preferably with a low blood alcohol
level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was not a simple task,
since he had two pitchers of martinis prepared, and never wanted his glass any
less than full.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My Dad with a
drink in his hand was hardly an uncommon sight, and in all my life I had never
seen him more than tipsy; his resistance was uncanny.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But now he seemed determined to achieve that elusive state
wherein all rational thought was buried under a fuzzy carpet of alcohol.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And all he wanted to talk about was Mom
and her ill-advised attempt at family unity, despite my ever-more-desperate
attempts to turn the conversation to <i>any</i><span style='font-style:normal'>
other topic, so long as the subjects were not just a single room away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Dad, why don't you find a game on the television?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I was watching the game when your mother told me that she
was inviting Rita and Amy for Christmas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"If I had clients, I could spend all my time on the phone
with them, instead of listening to your mother and Rita.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yesterday, I even faked a phone call,
but she ordered me to hang it up and 'participate in the family discussion'. .

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Noooo, your mother wants her and Rita to work on something

cookies together . . ."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Dad, what did your father think about Christmas?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"He didn't like your mom, let me tell you.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Called her a hippie communist
slut.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>God only knows what he would
have said about Rita . . ."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Dad, look at how the light comes through your drink
glass.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Isn't it pretty with all
the colors?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, I don't know how much longer I can take your aunt
being here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Christmas is supposed
to be my time to relax, but your mother and Rita . . ."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Eventually, I felt like yanking that glass out of his hand
and downing its contents myself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My limited experience with alcohol suggested that it would just come
right back up again, but maybe <i>that </i><span style='font-style:normal'>would
be enough to distract my Dad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Until Mom found the mess, that is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>No, better to just endure; that which does not kill you may make you
stronger, but until it did, it just made you sick, or bored.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was definitely bordering on the
tedious side, but as long as I resisted the urge to imbibe, I think I could
avoid the sick part.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After several hours, Quinn walked in from the kitchen, from
which I could hear voices disputing over the proper way to mix eggnog; she
looked haggard and on-edge, and her voice betrayed her weariness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, I don't know how much longer I can take this."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was whining, but since I shared the
sentiment, it didn't bother me all that much.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"I'm exhausted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I'm getting freakin' bags under my eyes, and I have to look cute for the
Christmas pictures tomorrow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've
done everything that I can, and they're just getting worse."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I pulled Quinn aside so Dad couldn't hear us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"If we're lucky, Mom won't be able to take it much longer
either, and she'll send Rita away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I doubt we can expect Rita to leave herself; without a boyfriend, she
has no one else to spend the holidays with, and I think she'll take this hell
over being alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course, I
don't believe in luck, so we'll probably have to keep this up through New
Year's, but we can't give up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dad
needs us."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He wasn't pale anymore;
his face was florid, with both liquor and rage, and I didn't consider this an
improvement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He didn't have a
bulging eye, but there were tells nonetheless, and every sign I could read -
his compulsive drinking, his obsessive raving - told me that he was reaching
his limit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I didn't want to see
what would happen once he reached it; somehow, I felt that a hallucinogenic
camping trip would seem like a real vacation in contrast.</p>

matter what Grandma does?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Why do
you have to fight over who gets what?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Let's not bicker about who killed who," I said in a
mock-English accent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Isn't
Quinn's argument a bit of the pot accusing the kettle of being a little too
dark?</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But it seemed to work; Mom and Rita bit their tongues and went back to
decorating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I joined in
sporadically, every now and then hanging a glass ball from a branch, while
Quinn tried to color-coordinate the ornament arrangement.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dad hovered on the edge of the group,
trying to maintain enough of a presence to keep Mom satisfied while avoiding
her active notice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His face was a
study in apprehension.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a while, we actually worked in harmony, or at least in
quiet; but soon I noticed that Mom was subtly rearranging the tinsel Rita was
hanging, while Rita was making faces at the older, shabbier ornaments.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They gradually became more and more
obvious in their efforts, until not even Tiffany could have missed their
battle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the dam broke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"My advice?!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

all you ever did was ignore me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
was your sister, I just wanted to help you, and you just resented me for
it!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You even turned Mother against
me!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You did that yourself, always wanting to be the best, the

attention!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You stole it!<span

</span>She never once helped me out at all!<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal>We all turned in shock as Dad exploded; he threw down the

<p class=MsoNormal>He clutched his left arm and his face screwed up in pain;
before any of us could react, his breath caught and his eyes bulged, and his
hand was clutching again, this time at his chest.<span style="mso-spacerun:

unconscious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After another second

<p class=MsoNormal>The emergency room at Cedars of Lawndale was chaotic as they
wheeled Dad away, surrounded by a cluster of doctors and nurses starting IV's
and injections.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mom was sitting in
a chair, working her way through a stack of admission forms, her only sign of
stress a vertical line between her brows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Rita was next to her, a bored expression on her face, probably wondering
if this inconvenient little incident was going to take too big a bite out of
her holiday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quinn and I were
sitting together a few seats away; she was crying into her hands, her sobs
interrupted only by the huge gasps of air she would suck in periodically.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was doing my best to console her,
patting her back in what I hoped was a sisterly fashion, all too aware of how
stiff my motions were, my thoughts divided between wondering if there was
anything I could tell Quinn honestly that might make her feel better and worry
for Dad's wellbeing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When this had
happened before, we had been quickly reassured that the attack had been minor,
with little damage; there was no such comfort offered to us this time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>All that effort, all that worry, and we didn't change a
thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Here we are, right where I
feared we would be if I didn't act to stop it, but here we are anyway.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Damn you, Dad, Mom, Rita.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And damn me, for interfering in the
first place; maybe if I had let Dad hide away, at least for a little while, he
might have been spared just enough of the stress and tension to avoid
this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All my actions were futile;
would inaction have made a difference?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And now it falls to me to comfort my partner in futility, but no Jane is
here to comfort me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I can't do it
myself; I can tell myself that everything is going to be okay, that Dad will be
home by the strike of Christmas midnight, but I won't wholeheartedly believe
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since when does life work out
that easily?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The cries of sick children and the wails of the wounded
filled the waiting room, the hurts of others intruding on my private pain.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Almost all the rest of Lawndale was
shut down for the holiday, but this place never slowed down.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The only concession made to the season
was a small Christmas tree in the corner, but even it looked cowed by what
surrounded it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Peace on Earth and
goodwill towards men were distant concepts in this place of perpetual
suffering.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not that I had been
getting a lot of it before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Thanks, Daria," Quinn said as the wave of sobs
receded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I'm sorry that I
couldn't keep Mom and Aunt Rita from fighting.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It's my fault Dad is in here."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I was surprised and rather ashamed to hear what I had
thought were my own personal recriminations coming from her mouth.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How selfish could I be, thinking that I
was the only one feeling guilty?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It wasn't you, Quinn," I said.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"You did everything you could, more than I could have.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't think anything could have
stopped this; it was going to happen eventually, and there's more than enough
blame to go around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At least you
tried to do something about it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Do you think he's going to be okay?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I sighed, as much to buy time as from despair, though that
was certainly there as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That
was the question I had been dreading.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The only honest answer I could give was the "I don't know" I had told
her before, and now I had even fewer reasons to give for hoping for the
best.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I tried as well as I could.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"He's made it through before.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This one looked worse, but it may end up being not that
different.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe this time he'll
actually take the doctor's advice seriously and start to really change his
lifestyle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We might start having
meatless frozen lasagna for supper."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>That actually got a small smile from her, which made me feel a bit less
useless.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'll make sure he does."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Quinn's statement had the gravity of a vow.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I'll learn how to make healthy meals
for him, and Mom will be glad to let me do the cooking."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She paused, and the tears started to
run again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"But, Daria, what if he
doesn't get better?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This time, I had nothing to say.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Fortunately, I was saved the uncomfortable silence I could
feel coming; a chime sounded from Quinn's pocket.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm sorry, Daria," she said, sounding truly contrite.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I'd forgotten I still had it."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her gaze swiveled from my face to her
pocket; her hand moved towards the sound, then jerked back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Answer it, Quinn," I said.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"It might help you feel better."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>To tell the truth, I was jealous; I wanted the distraction
of a friendly conversation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Apparently, so did she, for she quickly yanked the cell phone from her
pocket and flipped it open.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hello?" she said uncertainly.<span style="mso-spacerun:

really happy right now . . ."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Quinn filled Stacy in on what was going on, I returned my
attention to the room surrounding me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mom was standing at the admissions desk, and her conversation with the
nurse receptionist was becoming audible even from the other side of the room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"How long do you intend to keep us waiting here?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You've had my husband in there for over
half an hour, and we haven't heard a thing!<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We have a right to know what's going on!"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There was a pause as the receptionist
answered at a much more civilized level, making it impossible for me to
overhear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Don't try to give me
the runaround.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm a lawyer, and I
can make things very hot for this hospital if I think you're snowing us . . .
Do you honestly expect me to believe that you don't have a single person
available who can at least let us know how he's doing?! . . ."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>If I couldn't stop Dad from having a heart attack, at

whose near-infinite patience looked to be wearing thin.<span

she's going to call security and Mom will really flip out.</i><span
style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
reached out and touched my mother on the arm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Mom," I said firmly, "there's nothing you can do.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They'll let us know as soon as they
have any real news."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I knew from
personal experience that, completely against the Lawndale code, the Cedars
actually housed some competent professionals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Not now, Daria," Mom said, trying to brush me off.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Trust me, I know how to handle
hospitals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You can't get anything
out of them unless you hound them for it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Mom, if you don't calm down, the only thing you are going
to be getting out of them is a nice trip out the door, guided by big burly men
angry at being called away from their doughnuts."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I gave a slight tug on her arm, and tried another
tactic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Mom, your family needs
you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quinn's crying over the phone
to Stacy right now because you aren't around to comfort her."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Okay, maybe not strictly true, but she <i>was</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> talking to Stacy, and she </span><i>had</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> been crying, so it was close enough to be useful for
my purposes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And it accomplished
my purpose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, my <i>baby</i><span style='font-style:normal'>," she
exclaimed, and ran over to interrupt Quinn's conversation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I sent a mental apology to my sister
for the annoyance my necessary manipulation would no doubt cause her, then put
it out of my mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe I'd get
her something disgustingly cute from the gift shop later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Do you have any idea how long it might be until we know
something?" I asked the longsuffering woman behind the desk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm really sorry," she said, "but the doctors are very busy
with your father, and there's no way of knowing how long it will be until he
stabilizes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you keep your crazy
mother away from me, though, you'll be the first to know when there's any
news."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I thanked her, and returned to our little group of
worriers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quinn was doing her best
to wave Mom away and keep up her conversation with Stacy at the same time; I
thought I heard loud sobs and a few hysterical shrieks emanating from the phone
speaker.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was able to convince
Mom that she wasn't on the immediate verge of tears by the time I rejoined
them, but the distraction was enough; Mom didn't return to the desk to harry
the staff anymore.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I can't believe your husband had to go and ruin Christmas

holiday if he had just kept his nose out of our business."<span

ten times the man any of your husbands or boyfriends have ever been!<span

<p class=MsoNormal>"<i>Bait</i><span style='font-style:normal'> you?" Rita
replied, feigning wounded rage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"The first thing you did when I walked through the door was brag about
Daria, because you knew that Erin dropped out of school to get married.<span

you understand?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He was a large
man and quite imposing, and I didn't think a lot of the weight had been put on
by doughnuts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mom and Rita both
nodded their heads and mumbled apologies, and he left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Rita," Mom said at a normal volume but in a steel tone, "I

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Fine," Rita responded, the picture of offended
dignity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I'll be waiting for you
back at the house."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She stood up,
but Mom wasn't finished with her yet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, Rita," she said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"I want you to go home; your home, not ours.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't want to see you, and I certainly don't want you
around when Jake gets out of here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And if you say one more word against my husband, I don't want to see you
ever again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You can keep Mom's
money, she can buy you anything your heart desires for all I care; I'll still
take my life, and my family, over yours any day."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>It's a bit late to do Dad much good, but at least she
finally did it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She'll regret her
words later, of course, and she and Rita will go back to how they have always
been, but she did what she needed to do for right now.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I guess there are some people that you
really don't need to tolerate, people it is better to reject.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Letting some people in doesn't mean
letting them all in.</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I met Quinn's gaze; even in the middle
of her talk with Stacy, she had kept up with what was going on, and a smile of
relief had broken through her worried mien.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Now that she felt certain that she and I would not end up
like Mom and her sisters, she was glad to see Rita go.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I returned her smile with my own
version; less evident, but still very much there.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It was a small improvement to our otherwise grim
circumstances, but it felt like a step in the right direction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After calling a cab, Rita stormed out in a huff, leaving the
three of us in relative silence, except for the commotion all around us, from
which I at least felt disconnected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Unlike my norm, though, I could not wholeheartedly welcome the silence;
the fighting, as unpleasant as it had been, had at least been a distraction for
all of us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now both Mom and I had
to face our own thoughts, and there was only one possible subject for them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria," Mom said, her voice subdued.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was startled, even though I had heard her say something
similar to Rita.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Had Rita been the
only one of us who hadn't felt some measure of guilt for the event that had put
us here?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, Mom," I said, absolving both her and myself with the
thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"This wasn't your
fault.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No more than anyone
else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You were doing what you
thought was best for all of us; you might have carried it a bit too far, but
there was no way you could have foreseen this result.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I think Dad was probably doing his best to hide his illness,
maybe even from himself."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>How
many times in the past few days has he said he was doing fine?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Was he in denial the whole time?</i><span
style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Dad
could have chosen a long time ago to handle these things differently from how
he did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He could have chosen to
live more healthily than he did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It wasn't you who put him in here."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, are you saying that it is your father's fault that
he is here?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She did not looked
pleased, and I feared that in my desire to help her to see the issue in a
larger context, that I might have tread perilously close to the territory Rita
had been covering just a few minutes ago.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's no one's <i>fault</i><span style='font-style:normal'>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We've all contributed to it, not just
in the past few days but over years and years, but none of us hit the button
that said 'heart attack' and dropped him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You can't just blame yourself; if you have to blame someone, spread it
around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And you've taken steps to
keep it from getting worse; you sent your sister away.<span

now."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She didn't look particularly convinced, but she didn't press
the issue either; she did, however, start taking glances at the front desk, and
I wondered what I was going to have to do to keep my end of the bargain with
the receptionist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was spared
that particular conundrum, however, when a man in a white coat began walking
towards us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Are you the Morgendorffers?" he asked.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mom gave no verbal response, but the
intent gaze she immediately fixed on him was all the answer he needed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I heard Quinn give Stacy a rapid
farewell and close up her phone, and all three of us focused on what he had to
say.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm afraid the situation is not good," he started, with the
kind of practiced sympathy doctors cultivate to the point that it is impossible
to determine if it is professional or genuine.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"We've stabilized him right now, but just barely.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There's been a lot of damage to the
heart; we're hoping to avoid a transplant, but he might need a new valve.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The muscle has been overexerted, and it
looks as though it has been under a considerable amount of stress for some time
now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That's the most immediate danger.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If we can keep it from just giving out
over the next day or so, we'll be out of the worst of it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I would say that the next twenty-four
hours are critical.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you want,
you can stay here, but I would suggest at least taking the children home and letting
them get a good night's rest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There's nothing any of you can do here."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"If it's all the same to you, we'll stay," Mom replied,
after fielding glances from both myself and Quinn that made our desires
clear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"We want whatever news you
can give us, as soon as you know anything."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

inventory of the various aches in my joints and muscles, brought on by spending
the night sitting up in an ill-padded waiting room chair.<span

haunted by disturbing dreams, all of them dominated by the image of my father
lying on the ambulance gurney, helpless, while the doctors rolled him out of my
sight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Repose had been fitful, at

followed her gaze to find Quinn grinning at the both of us, with a very
satisfied air about her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She gave
a little wave, holding her cell phone in her hand, before returning her attention

machine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I guess she heard my

you're going to be that gross, at least let me know so I can get away
first."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She walked off, but I was

<p class=MsoNormal>"So why are you back so early?" I asked Jane.<span

<p class=MsoNormal>"It seems that the wandering Lanes are wandering for a

really have much of anything in common.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We ran out of nice things to say to each other after about a day, and
then we ran out of mean things another couple of days after that.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Eventually, the silence became pretty
awkward.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I got tired of lugging
around Dad's cameras, and I wanted to get back to you and Trent for Christmas,
so I used all the cash I had saved to ride road, rail, and mule to make it to
Lawndale in time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And here I am,
on schedule, and you weren't even around to greet me.<span style="mso-spacerun:

exactly what they had meant for me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

the staff, and then from killing Aunt Rita.<span style="mso-spacerun:

to eat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mom's asleep right now,
but I promise I'll keep an eye on her if she wakes up.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But get a bran muffin or some fruit or
something non-fattening, Daria; you really need to get away from sugar tarts if

my teeth and bite my lip and ignore all the things I can't stand for the sole
purpose of avoiding something even worse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class=MsoNormal>"Precisely," I said, relieved to be talking to someone who
knew me well enough to see where I was going with this.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Mom couldn't last two days with
Rita.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What makes me think I could
last two minutes?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'd end up exploding,
just as Mom did."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Which is how you ended up here."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't think my explosion would give anyone a heart
attack, but I could end up doing damage of a different kind.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Like the damage Mom and Rita were doing
to each other, right before . . ."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The nightmarish image of my Dad, clutching his chest and
falling to the ground, was burned into my memory, etched there as though by acid,
and just as permanent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It had
haunted my dreams, and now it intruded upon my waking; no matter how much
distraction Jane may have provided, remembrance was never more than a single
thought away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I dropped my spoon
into my half-full bowl and pushed my tray away, appetite vanished, and I
slumped back in my chair with a sigh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I wished we were in Jane's room, far away from here; leaning back on her
bed was much more therapeutic than these hard cafeteria seats.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Dammit, I thought I was distracting you," Jane said,
subdued.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Do you <i>want</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> to talk about it?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Not really," I said truthfully, "but it seems a bit
ridiculous to talk about anything else, like ignoring the eight-hundred-pound
gorilla in the room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I just wish
that I knew what to say about it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What
can I say, except that I wish it hadn't happened, which is a given, and that I
hope that he pulls through, which is obvious?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I could talk about how terrified I am that I might lose him,
and of what might happen to my entire family if we do.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I could talk about how fucking tired I
am of having to babysit my own mother and father while I'm on vacation, and how
frustrated I am that nothing Quinn or I did seem to make the slightest bit of
difference in the final outcome."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I could feel a convulsion of anger and fear and grief rise
up inside of me as I said the words - as the words poured out of me - and all
the uncertainty and frustration of the past few days came rushing to the fore,
but I held it back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Show some
restraint, Morgendorffer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Look
what happened when Mom let go, when Dad did.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>There are better ways of handling the situation without
letting everything just pour out of you like water through a broken dike.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe if you had been in a little more
control with James, you might have been able to call on him as well.</i><span
style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I
knew this was different; Jane would not be offended by my outburst, nor be hurt
by it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If there was any time I
could express exactly how I felt with no fear, it was now.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was sitting there across from me,
not saying a word, eyebrow arched in tacit inquiry, encouraging me to go
on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But my momentum was broken,
and all I could do was just sag in my seat, a burned-out conduit for my own
emotions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In my exhaustion, I felt
a single tear spill from the corner of my eye.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane noticed it too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Do you want to go someplace more private?" she asked,
motioning with her head to indicate the well-populated eating area around
us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Truth be told, I had forgotten
that we were surrounded by strangers, so caught up I had been in my own problems.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I was over the outburst now, and
this was as good a place to stay as any.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Unlike the waiting room, it at least did not scream "hospital" with
every glance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, I'm fine now," I assured her.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The corners of my mouth pulled upwards in an ironic grimace.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I guess I'm not dealing with
everything as well as I thought I was."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I think you're allowed a breakdown or two.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe one of the doctors here will give
you some nice, soothing pills.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Maybe that cute one you had the last time you were here."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane wiggled her eyebrows suggestively
and grinned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Are you sure you shouldn't be talking to Quinn?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hey, Daria, give me a break; I've been in the Amazon for
months, my father the only male within miles.<span style="mso-spacerun:

romp."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hospital time drags.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Once the initial rush of events and adrenaline wears off, it becomes a
struggle to not think about the one thing that you really have to think about,
because there is nothing else <i>to</i><span style='font-style:normal'> think
about.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then you reach a point
where even the recent emergency loses its power to consume your thoughts, and
time really begins to make its presence known.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Other than an occasional bit of excitement from an entering
emergency, there are really no distractions, and the minutes and hours blend
into the white wall surrounding you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The day being Christmas, things were not as bad as they could have been;
there was a quartet of Victorian-garbed carolers providing the requisite
holiday cheer to the subdued occupants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Things weren't as bad as they could have been; they were worse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The various members of the Morgendorffer and Company party
found their own ways to deal with the tedium.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane had picked up a pencil and a pad of paper from the gift
shop, and was sketching the carolers undergoing various old-style tortures,
placing one into stocks, another locked in a pauper's prison, and the
like.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quinn was spending the day
on her cell phone, talking with Stacy and Tiffany; whenever one would leave to
participate in some family holiday activity, she would call the other.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The phone bill was going to be
astronomical - seeing as how it was near the end of the month, I could only
presume that she had already used up her minutes - but I didn't think Mom would
begrudge her the money, this time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As for Mom, after pestering every passing doctor and nurse for a large
part of the night, one passing physician had finally given her a package of
sedatives, telling her that she had to either take one every few hours, or be
thrown out of the hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
had resentfully complied, and now she was alternating between dozing on her
seat and listening absently to the carolers.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Every now and then, the doctor would give us news, but it
was never anything substantial; Dad was a little better, a little worse.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the end, nothing ever seemed to
change; it was always a waiting game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I was really wishing that somehow, in all the commotion and panic of
getting Dad to the hospital, I had had the foresight to snatch a book on the
way out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, Quinn closed her cell phone and sat down next to
me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had kept a facade of
cheerfulness while she had been talking with her friends, a plastic smile glued
to her face, but now that it was over, she looked worn.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her lips sagged into a straight line,
and she slumped in her chair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
one of the three J's had seen her at that moment, they might not have
recognized her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her clothes had
not been changed since yesterday, and they hung wrinkled and disheveled on her
frame.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her hair was greasy and
limp, clumped together in thick strands, and save for a few runs of the hand
through its locks, was untended, tangled and unkempt.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no makeup left on her face, and her normally
bright blue eyes were dull with fatigue and worry.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She was lucky that there were no mirrors within our line of
sight, but the amazing thing was that I didn't think she would care if there
were; she displayed no self-consciousness towards her appearance, making no
effort to hide herself from view, not fretting over what cute doctor might see
her in such a state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I felt closer
to her already.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Tiffany finally run out of new sentences and start
repeating herself?" I asked, but instead of the smile I was hoping for, I got a
sigh instead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I think she did that about two minutes after I met her,"
Quinn replied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"<i>God</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>, Daria, I'm so tired of trying to talk to them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All Stacy wanted to say was how sorry
she was and how she hoped everything would be fine, which was nice to hear and
all but she never said anything else, for hours!<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>When she wasn't crying, that is.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Tiffany was just worried that Christmas dinner would make
her fat."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She buried her head in
her hands for a moment, not weeping, just exhausted. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria," she said after a few minutes, and there was a
little choke in her voice, so maybe she had been crying silently after
all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I know this sounds stupid,
and maybe even selfish, but I can't believe this is happening on
Christmas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>From now on, every
Christmas we have is going to remind us of this.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>How can we ever be happy on Christmas again?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Quinn, Dad might still pull through this," I reminded her,
but I couldn't fault her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Disturbingly similar thoughts had been running through my own head; the
anniversary of a family emergency would be bad enough without having the entire
world around us celebrating during it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I know, but even if he does, we'll always be reminded of
what happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's never going to
be the same again."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, it's not like our Christmases were ever that happy to
begin with."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The moment the words
were out of my mouth, I regretted them; I had spoken out of my own fatigue, out
of my own bitterness over the situation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My ire was not aimed at Quinn, but she bore the brunt of it anyway.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She stared at me, stricken.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, what are you talking about?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've always enjoyed Christmas!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I was just thinking about how we would fight every
Christmas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You'd make some remark
about whatever book I had bought you, and I would say something about the
makeup kit or the shoes that you had got me, and we would spend the rest of the
day mad at each other."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Saying it
now, it all sounded so pathetic, so trivial.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Was <i>this</i><span style='font-style:normal'> how we had
wasted our time together?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quinn
looked almost as guilty as I felt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I always appreciated your gifts, Daria," she said, "because
I knew that they meant that you loved me, no matter how geeky I thought they were.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But it always seemed easier to complain
than to say 'thank you'.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm not
really sure why.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I am really
sorry about that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's not hard to figure out why," I said ruefully.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"As much as we took any opportunity to
cut each other down, showing gratitude probably felt like a show of
weakness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I didn't want to show
you any vulnerable spots either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But, from now on, I promise that Christmas won't be like that anymore,
not because of me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn looked thoughtful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I guess," she said after a moment, "it's like what that old
wizard guy said in that movie we went to see, about having to do your best with
the time that you are given, or something like that.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I just hope that we're given more time with Dad."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So do I, Quinn."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, she smiled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Thanks, Daria," she said, and leaned over, placed her arm
around my shoulder, and squeezed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Though in normal circumstances I would have felt uncomfortable with
this, no matter how healthy our relationship was, this time it felt right,
almost like a completion, staving off the encroaching sense of isolation and
the ever-present dread.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then she
stood up and walked over to Mom, who was sitting quietly in her chair, head
bowed; she looked calm, but the pills the doctor had given her had run out, and
she was methodically cracking every knuckle in her hands, I can only presume
for lack of anything better to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That looked like it went pretty well," Jane said from
beside me, looking up from her latest sketch with a smile.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Have you figured out your answer?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Quinn's matured a lot from how I remembered her," I
said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"She's actually almost
tolerable now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What answer are you
talking about?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You were worried about how you should open up to people,
but you seem to be doing a great job with Quinn.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Doesn't that give you a clue?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"But it took years with Quinn, and it probably wouldn't have
happened if she hadn't changed as much as I have.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm not even sure what got us to this point to begin
with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's encouraging, but not
necessarily the answer."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Maybe that's part of it, just letting down your guard and
letting things happen naturally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Like you did with me, and Trent, and Tom."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Tom also took a while, if you recall.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Ouch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane, if you're saying that I can't rush this, that may be
true, but I can't just let it sit either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I have to take some action, or nothing will change."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"And sitting in your room thinking was action?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It was more than I had been doing before, though I'm
willing to admit that I might have taken it too far.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't know," Jane said with a shrug.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Despite my aura of omniscient wisdom,
I don't have all the answers; I was hoping that you would pick up on
something.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I just thought that I
would point out how well you were doing with Quinn and see if you could figure
something out from that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane, your confidence in me is overwhelming."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"But not as overwhelming as your B.O. right now.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You really need to take a shower sometime
soon."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Leave it to Jane to not
take even the most solemn of moments too seriously.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Thank God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"In that case, I will remove my offensive self from your
sensitive nose," I said, and nodded to where Quinn and Mom were sitting.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane waved her hand imperiously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Off with you then," she said in a really bad English

her work."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I walked over to where Quinn and Mom were sitting, their
hands tightly clutched to each other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They were huddled in on themselves, as if by doing so they could keep
the evils of the world at bay, stave off the anxiety that had become constant
in all of us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"This is taking too long," Mom was saying.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"We should have heard something by now,
something more than just 'we can't tell yet'.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It's not a good sign.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If there were any good news, they would have told us."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Mom, you can't think like that," Quinn said.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"You're scaring me.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Can't you think good thoughts?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, sweetie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I'm a mother; I have to think about these things, even when it's nothing,
so that you <i>don't</i><span style='font-style:normal'> have to.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But please keep thinking good thoughts
about your father, Quinn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We all
need them."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I thought worrying was my job," I said as I sat down beside
them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mom smiled sadly, or maybe
it was more of a grimace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"And you're very good at it, Daria," Mom replied, "too
good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You always saw too much too
clearly to be completely happy, but I always wished that you could be.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So, what do you see now?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That we don't know anything yet, either way."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"And that's why it's so hard, Daria.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I just wish there was something I could
<i>do</i><span style='font-style:normal'>."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But there wasn't, of course, and so the three of us just sat
there, each of us silently assisting the others through their own private
distress; Mom fighting the drive to act because there was nothing for her to
act on, Quinn vacillating between hope and fear, and I facing the anxiety of
ignorance that was so foreign to my nature.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Every so often, Jane would cast a supportive glance my way,
but this was a trial shared by the three of us alone, and though she was my
closest friend, she was left on the outside this time.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She understood that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sound of assured, heavy footsteps approaching drew our
attention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We looked out to see
the doctor standing in front of us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He didn't need to speak; the look on his face was unmistakable.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mom sucked in her breath with a choking
sound, and Quinn began to wail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm sorry," he said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"We did everything we could do, but . . ."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So passed Christmas Day.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>So passed my father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I sat in the viewing room of the funeral home, feeling numb
and empty, as I had been feeling for almost two days now, ever since the doctor
had delivered his final news.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
seemed to me that I should be grieving, sad, overcome with some gut-wrenching
sorrow, but all my emotions were walled away from me, cut off by a fuzzy
barrier of disconnection.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
awareness floated above them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
wasn't like I was drunk or high.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
was in full contact with the world around me; it was myself that I had lost
touch with.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One feeling that did make it through the barrier was
annoyance at all the people surrounding me.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The room was crowded, filled with well-wishers, mostly
business associates of my parents; they would walk in, spend a few seconds
looking at my father's body lying exposed in a wooden box, and then pass on to
talk amongst themselves or to one member of my family or another.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Over time, two distinct groups had
developed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At the center of one
stood my mother, clad in black, doing her best to carry on normal conversations
with the lawyers and clients that had gathered to watch her grieve; while she
was spared the odious task of having to appear happy, since no one expected
that of her, she still forced herself to be pleasant and hospitable, to put on
a strong face and a "life goes on" attitude.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But I could see the strain of it in her eyes, the emptiness
she was feeling; none of them knew that she was crying herself to sleep at
night, alone in a bed now grown far too large for her.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And so they went away amazed at how
strong and resilient a woman was Helen Morgendorffer, never bothering to look
beyond the surface.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the center of the other group were Grandma Ruth and Uncle
Esau.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was the first I had
seen of my grandmother since she had arrived, and the first I had ever seen of
my uncle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Grandma blamed my mother
for Dad's death, saying that if she had taken better care of her baby, then he
would have never had another attack; that was all that she had said to Mom.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She and Uncle Esau were staying at Le
Grand Hotel, and would be leaving right after the funeral.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was not angry at Quinn or myself,
so I could have talked to her, but I didn't feel like it; she might have not
been angry with me, but I was very unhappy with her.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>As I had told Mom earlier, she bore no more blame for Dad's attack
than anyone else, and to see my grandmother hit her right on her most
vulnerable spot, at a time when she needed support the most, infuriated
me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe I could have excused it
away, say that her grief was such that she could not be held responsible for
her actions, but when I felt anger at her at least I was feeling something, and
I wanted to feel <i>something</i><span style='font-style:normal'> right now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then there was Uncle Esau, the elder of the Morgendorffer
siblings, and a man molded by Mad Dog into his own image, the man he had attempted
to mold my father into as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>His face was stern and hard, carved from ice; his military uniform
looked less like a badge of honor than a warning sign, like the bright coloring
of a venomous animal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He was a man
of few words; at least, he was at present.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He had shaken my hand when he entered the room, and had
addressed me in a tone that had much politeness but little warmth.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now he was standing at Grandma Ruth's
side like a sentry, ready to catch her should she faint with grief or with
simple overexertion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For all the people in the room, the area around me was
surprisingly clear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had tried to
be as courteous and friendly as I could when people, most of whom I had never
seen before, had stopped to offer me their condolences; but it must have been
quite apparent that I mostly just wanted to be left alone, free from irritating
intrusions into my own private desolation, and I could only assume that the
word had spread quickly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I did not
want insincere consolations from people present only because their business
with my parents demanded it, and at any rate, it took too much effort for me to
talk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My tongue, indeed my whole
body, felt weighed down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The only
person within comfortable speaking distance of me was Jane, who sat next to me
on the bench and quietly people-watched.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Her presence was welcome, and for now, her silence even more so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stacy and Tiffany were standing next to the coffin with
Quinn, looking down onto my father's painted face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"They really did a great job with the makeup, Quinn," Stacy
said with forced cheerfulness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"And the suit looks really good on him.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And this coffin is really nice and padded; I'm sure he'll be
very comfortable in it."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy was
wringing her hands together, and her voice cracked nervously on the last word.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was clearly way out of her depth,
but still doing her best to give what compliments she could, her way of
honoring the dead and comforting the living.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Quinn gave a sad nod in return, and a quiet "thank you".</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Heeee loooooks sooooo naaaturaaaal," Tiffany drawled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>No, he doesn't, you moron,</i><span style='font-style:
normal'> my mind snarled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>He
looks overly made-up and still, and he feels stiff and cold.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Does that seem natural to you?</i><span
style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For a
moment, anger bloomed inside me, and I welcomed it, but then it faded back
behind the wall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>Oh,
hell, I can't be angry at her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She's just repeating what she heard some other idiot say at some other
funeral, in some other attempt at meaningless consolation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She's trying, at least, like Stacy, to
help Quinn feel better; misguided or not, I can't fault her for that.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Eeeeewwwwww, Quiiiin, yoouuuuur eeeeeyes . . . theeeeeey're
aaaaalllll reeeeeeeed."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And I
wanted to strangle her again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Miss Blum-Deckler is sounding particularly perceptive
today," Jane said, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm waiting for her to tell Quinn that black isn't her
color," I replied, but my heart was not in the quip.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Suits you pretty well, though," Jane said, eyeing the sable
gown Mom had insisted that I wear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was choking me at the neck, and the hose kept riding up my hips, but
these were distant irritations, unworthy of notice.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I simply nodded, and we returned to our silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A familiar voice sounded above my downturned eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hello, Daria."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I looked up to find Aunt Amy standing in front of me, a somber
look replacing her usual amused expression.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I stood up to greet her, and she enveloped me in a quick
hug, which I found to be more comforting than I would have thought.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She let me go and sat down beside me,
then turned her head to view her sister, surrounded by sympathizers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm guessing that you must be Jane," she said when she
turned back to us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She extended
her hand to my friend and Jane briefly took it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"Your mother appears to be handling this calmly enough.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Which one of you slipped her the tranquilizers?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I've been pumping my excess paint fumes into her bedroom,"
Jane said, before I felt the need to reply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Good idea; Helen could probably use a nice high right
now."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Amy turned her gaze back to
Mom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I've got to give Jake
credit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He stuck with her all
those years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Remarkable
fortitude."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her mouth curved in
fond remembrance, and I knew she meant no harm, but Amy's jokes were actually
getting on my nerves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Had all the
humor just been squeezed out of me?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>What kind of state had I come to when I couldn't even appreciate a
harmless jibe?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My feelings must
have been written on my face, for when Amy turned back to me, her attitude
changed completely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I'm sorry,
Daria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You know I didn't mean any
harm; I'm just not very good at these kinds of situations.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Didn't I tell you once that sarcasm was
a great way to deal?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is, but
not in every circumstance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
should know better, too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was
older than you when my father died, but not that much older, and I remember how
much it hurt; and we knew for a while that it was going to happen, so we were
at least prepared, or as prepared as anyone can be.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>At the time, I probably would not have appreciated someone
making jokes at my family's expense either.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>So, how <i>are</i><span style='font-style:normal'> you
feeling, Daria?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sick of being asked that question," I responded sharply,
the words spilling out of me before I realized they were there.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I didn't want to alienate this
particular comforter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Amy, I'm
not really feeling anything, except feeling that I <i>should</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> be feeling something. <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>And the rare times I do feel something, it's anger or
irritation, never the sadness that I think should be there.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mom and Quinn have spent a lot of the
past few days in tears, while I've just stood there silently.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mom hasn't said anything, but I'm sure that
she thinks I'm being callous, and maybe I am.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>There are times I've felt that grief is about to break
through, but then it goes away again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And that scares me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was
more worried about my own problems a few days ago than I am sad about a very
real tragedy that's happening right now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But I loved my father, I know I did.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Why is nothing coming out of me?"<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Then I was feeling something, but it was not the sorrow that
I craved; it was pure frustration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I felt Jane's touch on my shoulder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, Daria," Amy said, shaking her head sadly.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I understand completely.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Don't worry about it, though I know
that you are going to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I know that
you're not cold, and so does Helen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Your feelings will come in time, I guarantee it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of us just take a bit longer to
get in touch with them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When my
dad died, I didn't cry or anything like that for days; I felt sorry that he was
gone, but it didn't really hit me for real until several days later.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rita felt it immediately, of course;
your mother held it in until she was alone, and then let it all out.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She kept me up at nights; I could hear
her through the walls, crying when she thought no one could hear.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We all react differently, you see."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Or I can make you feel something right now, if you want,"
Jane said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I could call up Trent
and ask him to sing you a love song.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Think that would do anything?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It had been ages since Jane had threatened me with her brother, and the
joke brought back a flood of old memories of the days she and I would sit back
and watch the world go by us, commenting on anything and everything that caught
our fancy, never thinking that such fun would fall out of our favor.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For a moment, I was some other time and
other place, and the relief - however momentary - was very gratefully received.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It looks like you're in pretty capable hands here," Amy
said, and shared a satisfied nod with Jane.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"Good thing, too, since I'm probably going to have to start
making the rounds here soon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
don't see Rita anywhere; has she not arrived yet?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Not that I'm complaining too much, you understand."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Rita wasn't invited," I said.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"She and Mom had a fight, and they're not speaking to each
other right now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They might not be
speaking to each other ever again."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"My God, what happened?"<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Amy was shocked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"I thought Helen was trying to patch things up with her for good."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"She was," I replied wearily.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>These were not memories I wanted to dredge up, and knowing
this, Jane took over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"They were fighting when Jake had the heart attack," she
said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Then they fought again when
they were in the hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Helen
threw her out of the house."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I . . . see," Amy said, eyes wide.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"It's too bad I wasn't there.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe I could have done something."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, you couldn't," I said.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Amy, you're here," Mom interrupted, walking up to us.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Amy stood up and the two embraced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, Helen, I'm so sorry," she said, with no trace of irony
or sarcasm in her voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Thanks, sis," Mom said.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"You've been keeping Daria company?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm glad to see that; I think she needs
all she can get right now."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mom
turned to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Honey, are you sure
you don't want to come with me for a while.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It might do you good, being with people."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Might help me act more normal, you
mean.</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Actually, I would have welcomed Mom's company, or Quinn's, but I couldn't
take being in the middle of the press of people.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I shook my head in denial.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Mom looked saddened and frustrated, but she respected my
wishes, and she and Amy walked off by themselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She was soon replaced by Quinn, who sat down next to me with
a slight sound of relief.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was
dressed and styled perfectly, leaving behind the unkempt look she had in the
hospital, but her expression was haunted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As Tiffany had observed, her eyes were red and puffy, with dark bags
below them; her skin looked grey.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
life that had animated her features looked drained away, and her natural,
effortless beauty with it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
Quinn looked old.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm so tired," she said, and her voice sounded it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I just want to get out of here.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is just creepy, all these people coming
in to look at Dad like that."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
shuddered, and wiped her eyes with a handkerchief.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"Why do they do this, anyway?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I would rather remember him as alive, not like . . . <i>that</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't think this is really for us, Quinn," I
replied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I think this is to make
everyone else feel better, so they can feel they've done something for us by
showing up."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"They're not all like that, Daria," she protested.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Stacy and Tiffany really wanted to
help me feel better, and Jane really wants to be here for you.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And it was nice to see them."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"But it would be nicer to see them somewhere else."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She couldn't deny that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah, it would be."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She was quiet for a minute or so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Daria, how do you do it?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
haven't been able to stop crying for the past few days, except for every now
and then, and I hate it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It helped
a little at first, I guess, but now it just makes me feel even worse.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I know you're sad, Daria; how do you
keep from crying all the time?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>If you only knew.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Here you are trying to find out my secret, but my only secret is that
I'm envying you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Before, I had
walls that held out other people; now that I'm trying to tear them down, I seem
to have developed walls to hold out myself.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Which is worse, I wonder?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And can I ever really do anything about either?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But it helps to know that she doesn't
believe that I'm cold; she assumes that I'm sad, even though she doesn't see
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She has that kind of faith in
me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That's something, at least.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's nothing, Quinn," I said aloud.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Nothing you could replicate, and
nothing you would want to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Be glad
that you can cry; I feel like I never could."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You can cry, Daria," Quinn said, sounding quite certain of
herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"You're not a bad
person.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You'll cry when you feel
ready, I'm sure."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You and Aunt Amy think remarkably alike, Quinn."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I thought that you were the one who thought like Aunt
Amy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I guess I really am smart
after all."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her mouth curled into
something that came closer to a smile than I had seen on her for hours, if not
days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm starting to feel inferior, sitting with all you smart

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn sagged onto my arm, resting her tired frame, while

<p class=MsoNormal>I was in my bed a few hours later, unable to sleep.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My guilty conscience would not let up,
berating me for my lack of feeling, my inability to grieve my father's death,
and the voice in my head made repose impossible.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I tossed and turned for over an hour, then reluctantly gave
up on the effort; the deathly silence of the house made the voice in my head
far too loud to ignore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If I were
going to gain any respite, it would have to be some other way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I hauled myself out of bed and over to my bookshelf, looking
for the volume of Tolstoy I had been reading before . . . everything had
happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It wasn't in its usual
spot, nor anywhere else I usually kept whatever book I was working on at the
time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I strained my fatigued brain
to remember where it might be, and I remembered the last place I had read
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On the living room couch,
right as Rita had walked in the door for the beginning of her visit.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>I guess I must have gotten caught up
in all the commotion and left it there.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I made my way down to the family room, walking as softly as
possible to avoid disturbing anyone; they needed their rest.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As did I, but one takes what one can
get.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I found the book shoved
halfway underneath the couch, but with no real damage inflicted, and rather
than drag myself back upstairs, I sat down where I was to begin my
reading.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, to my surprise, I
heard voices coming from the kitchen; after a second, I could tell that it was
Mom and Amy, having a late-night talk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>At first, I ignored them, but then I heard the mention of my name, and
by instinct, my ears pricked up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>". . . Daria told me in the hospital that I shouldn't blame
myself," Mom was saying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"That I
wasn't any more responsible for Jake's death than anyone else, but I just can't
absolve myself that easily."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her
voice was flat, broken.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The mask
was gone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Dammit, Amy, I could
have done better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If I had just
had a little more self-control . . ."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I wanted to console her, to reassure her once more that
Dad's blood did not lie on her hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But that impulse felt wrong to me; this was a moment between sisters,
and I had only recently begun to realize just how special those moments could
be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So, amazed at my own
brazenness, I eavesdropped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Come on," Amy responded, "you know what Rita is like.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She would try the patience of a saint;
and you, Helen, are no saint."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't need you to tell me that.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She's horrible, I know, but I should have held myself back
more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not that I'll probably ever
need to worry about it again; after the things she said at the hospital, it'll
be a cold day in hell before I'll want to hear her voice."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mom's voice sounded aggrieved.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"And she's not even the worst one;
Mother's coming in just in time for the funeral tomorrow, and then she's
leaving right after!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Has to be
back to see Erin and Brian in from their flight tomorrow night.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Can't let them think she's forgotten
about them, after all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And here I
am, a grieving widow . . . Oh, god, Amy, I hadn't used that word before.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm a <i>widow</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>, a widow with two teenage daughters!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How am I going to handle that?"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her voice began to rise before she
forcibly lowered it again, no doubt to avoid waking Quinn and myself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Helen, you don't need to worry about that," Amy said in
soothing tones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Daria's grown
into a wonderful young woman, really, no matter how she may scare you at
times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And Quinn's really growing
into herself as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You've
already done a good job with both of them.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And very soon, Quinn will be away like Daria, and your job
will be done."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, Amy," Mom said, and I could almost see her shaking her
head at her sister.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I don't think
it works that way; you don't stop being a mother just because your children
move away and grow up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I don't
even know how to deal with them right now.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Quinn spends her time crying; that tears my heart to pieces,
but at least I can understand it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria, though . . . I'm really afraid for her.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Ever since Jake . . . passed on, she's just been in a shell.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her eyes look dead to me.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm so scared that this might have
pushed her over an edge."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Helen, trust me on this.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria's going to be alright.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Remember how I was after Father died?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She's dealing with this in her own way,
and she'll show her grief eventually, in her own time.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Don't worry about her, just be there
for her."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When she had told me
this earlier, it had been nice to hear; but this time, maybe because I knew she
wasn't just saying things to make me feel better about myself, it had the ring
of truth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was no guarantee that
this cursed numbness would ever give way to anything more comforting, but it
was at least a reason to believe it might.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I hope you're right, Amy.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And thank you, for everything you said about both Daria <i>and</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> Quinn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They've both turned out better than I could have imagined, and soon
they'll both be gone, and then it will just be me here."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The voice cracked.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I don't know if I'll be able to handle
that, Amy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's hard enough now,
when Daria and Quinn are still around to occupy my attention, to make the place
seem a little less empty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I
already can feel the hole.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No
offense to you, sister, but you can't understand what it's like to lose someone
like this, someone you've lived with, loved with, for over twenty years.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He became a part of me in a way that I
never knew could happen with another person, and now that he's gone . . . it's
like a part of </span><i>me</i><span style='font-style:normal'> has been
stripped away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not a part of my
body, but of whatever it is that's inside that body.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He's gone, and I don't think I can ever feel whole again."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a minute, there were no words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Amy, I know you never understood why I married him . .

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, it's okay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I know that you and Rita and Mother never really got what I saw in
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There were times I didn't
either."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A pause, as if to collect
herself or her thoughts, then, "but . . . he was a <i>good</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> man, Amy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He had such a caring and loving heart, such a passionate heart.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That was something I needed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Admittedly, sometimes that passion was
misdirected, expressed as rage against his own father or his military school;
but he also loved our girls fiercely, and was completely committed to us as a
family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I knew there was nothing
he wouldn't do for us, nothing that would stand between him and our happiness
and welfare.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was when I saw
that side of him that I knew I could not have chosen a better man with which to
have children, or spend my life."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I sat there, silent and amazed.<span style="mso-spacerun:

that the trait that could drive us all crazy was also the very reason that she
had loved him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, there were
times <i>I</i><span style='font-style:normal'> had wondered what had kept them
together all these years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was
seeing my father through new eyes indeed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I stood beside my father's grave, staring down at the earth
below me, as the minister read empty words of comfort from his little black
book.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The hollowness inside me had
not yet passed, and so I found myself wishing that this ritual would just end,
that we could bypass this absurd attempt at hope and just commit my father to
his final resting place, where he would stay for as long as I lived, until one
day I joined him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A part of me
almost longed for that, an eternity of feeling nothing with no guilt attached
to the lack; as opposed to the nothing I felt now that tormented my
conscience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even more so now, when
I was surrounded by people visibly mourning a loss I should have felt more
keenly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On my left side stood Mom, her face impassive, but her hands
clutching at her skirt, as though by holding on to her clothing she could hold
on to her control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was wearing
the face she always wore in public since Dad's death.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>There were no tears on her cheeks, no heaving in her chest;
but her body was trembling slightly, a constant tremor like a man having to
carry a weight that was a little too heavy for him to bear.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I doubt anyone sitting farther away
from her than I could have even noticed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I didn't know whether to be proud of her control or fearful that it
might eventually slip.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To my right was Quinn, who had no such conundrum to
face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her face was wet, her makeup
running down her cheeks, and every now and then her body would convulse with
another sob.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her appearance and
general demeanor had improved little from the day before, when we had all sat
in the viewing room together, though she was crying less now.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There had been few words exchanged
between us since then, though I had several times held her wordlessly as she
cried, and even now her hand would occasionally reach out and briefly clasp my
own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I wished I had more and
better solace to give her, but the little I had been able to provide had seemed
to be of benefit to her, and had become my one assurance that I might not yet
be completely hardened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now she
was drinking in every word that the minister was saying, staring at him as
though he were a man offering her water after a long sojourn in the desert, and
so I had to concede that even if his words meant nothing to me, they might be of
some use after all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Arrayed throughout the small gathering around the
rectangular hole in the ground were several other familiar faces, and some that
were not so familiar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Aunt Amy was
on the other side of Mom from myself, and Grandma Barksdale next to her.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Grandma Ruth and Uncle Esau faced us
from the other side of the coffin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Grandma looked frail beyond human endurance, and Esau was holding her
up; otherwise, it looked as though she might stumble into the hole before her,
and maybe not by accident.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Esau
was impassive, his only apparent concern being the welfare of the old woman
beside him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>From the little I had
heard, he had been the favorite of Mad Dog, while Ruth had favored my father,
but he seemed to hold it against her far less than Dad had held Mad Dog's
favoritism against him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But then,
I found it hard to believe that the inequalities in Grandma's treatment had
been nearly as severe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Or maybe it
was simply the military training, discipline above all else, certainly over
personal feeling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Further down from me, on my own side of the gathering, were
Jane and Trent, each clothed in what passed for them for solemn attire.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Every now and then, Jane would catch my
eye, conveying a silent offer of support, or an inquiry into my condition.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I did my best to let her know that her
offers were appreciated, but that there was little right now that I needed that
anyone else could provide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
father's empty body lay not five feet in front of me, shielded from human view
by a wooden shell, and there was nothing anyone could do to change that.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I longed to mourn for him, but there
did not seem to be anything that could be done about that, either.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So I just kept staring at the ground
below me, and waiting for it all to end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The minister had ceased his reading about the valley of the
shadow of death, and commenced his eulogy for my father.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He praised him for his devotion to his

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>I can count on my fingers how many times we've gone to
church, how many times I or my father has ever seen this man.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And now he thinks he has the right and
the experience to tell me the kind of man that he was, to act sorrowful as
though he had lost a dear friend, when to him Dad might as well have been a
stranger off the street?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A few
Christmases and Easters spent in this man's captivity does not make him an
expert on my father's psyche, no matter what kind of collar he wears.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What arrogance it takes for him to do
this!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>And how are you any different?</i><span style='font-style:
normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The accusing thought,
from some buried part of my own mind, nearly staggered me.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>You spent eighteen years
living with the man, breathing the same air, sharing the same food,
experiencing the same family turmoils and strifes, but how much did you really
know him?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Time after time, you
turned away, frustrated by his rants and annoyed at his childishness, and you
never even bothered to push through that to find the man underneath.</i><span
style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Unnoticed by me at the time, a tear rolled down my cheek.</span><i><span

turned it into a joke.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When he
made the effort, however uncomfortable and uncertain, to reach out to you, you
gave him your shoe size in return.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You were amazed when you found out why your mother loved him, because
you had never found out for yourself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You loved him as a father, but did you ever value him as a man?</i><span
style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Another
tear, a twin to the first, emerged from my other eye.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Oh, god, what have I done?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I've had a lifetime of opportunities, chances to learn who
my father was, chances to see beyond the exterior and truly know his inner
self, and I wasted almost every one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I distanced myself from my family, and especially him, because I feared
disappointment, feared that he would make too many demands, take too much
work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was frightened by his
rages, frightened that whatever tolerance I may have had would be shattered if
I got too close, and so I never saw him as much more than a caricature.</i><span
style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My face
was slick with salty water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>I
loved him, but only as a father; I could never have loved him as a person,
because I never knew him as a person.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And even as I have worked recently to let others in, I never really
thought about letting him in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
was always and forever the same with us, doting but unhinged father and loving
but distant daughter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And that's
all that it can ever be now.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I heard a sound; a sniff, followed by a stuttered gasp.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It took a few moments before I realized
that it was coming from me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
followed by another, and another, and almost before I could realize what was
happening my eyes were streaming with tears and my breath was coming in sniffs
and broken by catches in my throat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It felt miserable; it felt wonderful.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And then an arm was around my shoulder, and I was leaning
into my mother's coat, face turned into her body to hide the tears from the
prying eyes I felt on me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As the
minister droned on, Mom made quiet, comforting noises, reassuring even though
they made no literal sense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Another, smaller set of arms encircled me from behind.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quinn.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She said nothing, but I felt comforted nonetheless.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All the emotion, the grief, the sorrow,
that had felt so distant and unreal before now flowed through me in a cleansing
wave, leaving me feeling hollow and drained, but whole.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My father was gone, and I would never
have the chance to make amends for a lifetime of dismissal; wisdom, as is far
too often the case, comes too late.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And I wept for the loss, both of my father and of time itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Slowly, the tears subsided, and I untangled myself from the
web of limbs holding me upright.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
saw the minister stepping away from the grave, and my father's coffin being
slowly lowered into the hole.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
sunk further and further away from me, but the distance seemed not to be so
much physical as spiritual; I could feel my father's presence becoming ever
more distant, and soon his physical remains would be covered in earth, and that
presence would be gone forever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Never before had I encountered such certain and total loss, and no
longer did it seem unreal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I stood there, I felt a new presence next to me, and I
looked to see Jane standing there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She said nothing, but placed her hand on my shoulder.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mom took her handful of dirt and tossed
it into the grave, her movements slow, fully aware of the weight of symbolism
behind her action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As she walked
away, the crowd dispersed as the professional gravediggers took over.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Most people headed quickly back to
their cars, anxious to escape this reminder of mortality.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A few hung around to exchange
pleasantries and condolences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mom
and Quinn and Amy and Jane stayed close to me, and Trent walked up to join us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"How are you feeling now, <i>amiga</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>?" Jane asked in the quiet tones one naturally adopts
at a funeral.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The small upturn on
one side of her mouth showed that she had already guessed the answer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Better, I think," I said, my voice still rather thick.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That's good, honey," Mom said, her voice sounding not very
dissimilar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I was beginning to
worry about you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I wasn't," Amy declared confidently.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I knew she would be fine, given time."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I was worried too, Mom," I said, surprised at how much
everyone else seemed to have picked up on what I thought was my private
fear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"But, I feel better now, in
some ways."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>In other ways, I
feel worse; but that is my own fault, my own shortcoming, and something I will
have to work on myself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No reason
to burden all of them with it.</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"And how are you doing, Mom?"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Amazingly, I didn't think I had asked
her this question in days, so wrapped up I had been in my own guilt.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But after last night, I was worried
about her as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'll be okay," she said, "in time.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It will be a while before things are
back to normal for us, but we'll get there eventually."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>A little overly optimistic, possibly, and maybe just
bravado on her part, but I hope that it's true, whatever 'normal' means
anyhow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But if that means things
just going back the way that they were, I don't think I want to return
completely to 'normal'.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've had
one missed opportunity made all too obvious to me; how many others have I
missed and never even noticed?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
can't just close my eyes to them anymore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Is this possibly the real first step towards tearing down my wall, just
being aware of the possibilities for relationships that pass me by because I'm
too aloof or afraid to pursue them?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And if I am aware of them, don't I have to try for them as well?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe Jane was right, and that to
change things, I'm going to have to act first and think later.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of the time, anyway.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That's a scary thought; isn't that what
I've always despised the most in other people, the lack of thought that goes
into their actions?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But maybe it
has its place, so long as it doesn't completely take over my life.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dad, if I can do this, then I'll do it
for you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My memorial, to treat
others as I should have treated you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'>A few nights later, I lay
on my bed, staring up at the ceiling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Save for me, the house was empty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I hadn't seen much of Mom since the funeral; she had buried herself in
her work, leaving early and coming home very late, sometimes after I had
already retired.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I wished that she
would spend more time at home, but I understood her reasons why; work was her
distraction, the panacea she needed to get through the day, to push to the back
of her mind the image of the empty bed that lay ahead of her every night.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And so she was doing now.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I could only hope that she would not
completely lose herself in her work, that when the necessity for continual
distraction eventually faded, she would return to her normal schedule and the
remaining daughter who needed her presence at home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

doing little but sitting alone in her room or watching TV.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She and I had only had a few
conversations in the last few days, at her lead never venturing beyond the
mundane, but she seemed to have enjoyed them; they were the only time I had
seen her even remotely approach the animation with which she had formerly
embraced her entire life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I
would be departing for Boston tomorrow morning, leaving Mom the only one in the
house with her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She still had her
friends - she was out with them even now - but it seemed to me that she needed
more now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She needed family, and

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'>I myself had spent a good
deal of time at Jane's, reacquainting myself with this vital presence in my
life that had been too long absent, her companionship beginning to heal the
wounds I had suffered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had told
her about what had happened to me at Dad's funeral, the realizations I had come
to there; she had listened, sagely, and encouraged me, and made a joke whenever
she felt it was time to lighten the mood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But we had done normal things as well, chatted about </span>Sick, Sad
World<span style='font-style:normal'> or her newest artworks, and listened to
Trent and Jessie jam in the basement as they tried to put together a sound for
whatever new band they might start, since the Spiral had recently
dissolved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We had talked about the
upcoming semester, and made plans for living together in Boston.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Though thoughts of Dad were never far
from my mind, I found that they did not always have to be in the forefront;
there were times I could forget myself in what Jane and I were doing, and for a
while it would be as though nothing had ever happened.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And when those thoughts did rise up,
Jane was there for me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, as my
departure time had drawn closer, I had spent more time at home, unwilling to
just abandon my family before leaving; though I missed the time with Jane,
after seeing what even those little talks had done for Quinn, I did not regret
my decision.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And now, for the

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'>I stood at the front door
of the Morgendorffer household, bag slung over my shoulder, ready to make the trip
back to Boston, with Mom and Quinn there to see me off.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mom's presence encouraged me; she had
skipped work to be here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span>She
showed up for this, so she's not completely gone.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I can only hope she remembers what she told Amy, that Quinn
needs her presence every day as much as I want it right now.<span
style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quinn
was trying her best to be brave, to look cheerful instead of forlorn, and
though she had very little success at it, I loved her for the effort.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I once again felt guilty about leaving
her almost all alone in this house of memories, and it was possible that Raft
would have allowed me to take the semester off, but I felt that it was
necessary for me to move on with life; the world does not stop for the
tragedies of its inhabitants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Staying at home would do me no good, I was certain.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And now here I was, ready to drive off,
first to pick up Jane, and then to the apartment in Boston she had found for
both of us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'>"Be careful on the roads,"
Mom was saying, "and drive carefully.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Don't be talking to Jane the whole time and ignoring the cars in front
of you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And call me when you make
it; I want to know you're okay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Just . . . be safe, Daria."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She stepped forward and hugged me tightly, clutching me as if frightened
that if she let go, I would float away forever.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It felt . . . good, comforting, safe.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I realized how much I didn't want to
leave either of them, how much I would miss them when I was gone.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Before, I had been too consumed with my
own problems to think much about my family; those days were gone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'>"</span>Mo-om<span
style='font-style:normal'>," Quinn said, after Mom had held me for over a
minute, "you're hogging her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Let
me have her for a bit."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mom handed
me over to my sister, and Quinn's embrace proved even firmer and more desperate
than my mother's.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Remember your
promise, Daria," she said into my ear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Promise you'll come see me; I want us to hang out like sisters."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span>So do I, Quinn.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just like sisters.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Like friends.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'>I had to pull myself out
of the hug before I was able to respond.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'>"Don't worry, Quinn," I
said, and to my embarrassment I found I had to clear my throat before I was
able to speak clearly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I'll come
home soon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And you can always come
visit me, you know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I want you
to."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'>"I'll do that," she said,
and I knew it was a promise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'>But the pick-up time for
Jane was fast approaching, and farewells to loved ones could not last
forever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I said my good-byes,
swore that I would come back soon, and then I was out of the house.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The door closed behind me with a
mournful thud.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'>The apartment in Boston
was small, but there were two bedrooms, and enough space for us to fit our most
crucial possessions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, it
was better than the dorm in which I had spent my first semester at Raft; Jane
was lucky, as she would be starting BFAC without ever having to go through that
particular hazing ritual.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But the
collection of boxes and odd furniture we had scattered about was familiar
enough, and already I could feel myself settling back into the college mindset,
finding the holiday and all that had happened during . . . not behind me, but
at least in less of my conscious thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The mindless work of unpacking, started the morning after we arrived,
helped as well, as did the friendly conversation during it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'>All this was interrupted
by a knock at the door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I looked
up in surprise; no one in Boston yet knew where we lived, and while I had
invited Mom and Quinn up for a visit, I was pretty sure they would not have
taken me up on it </span>this<span style='font-style:normal'> quickly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'>"Who could that possibly
be?" I asked Jane rhetorically, and was again surprised to see a too-knowing
grin on her face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'>"Why don't you answer it
and find out?" she said with noticeable glee.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"Better hurry, before they think no one's home."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I hesitated, but she waved me on with
such urgency that I moved without thinking, all the while wondering what Jane
could possibly have up her sleeve.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'>I opened the door to find
James standing behind it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'>For a few uncertain,
unstable seconds, neither of us spoke; I looked at him in utter shock, while he
stuck his hands in his pockets and made awkward shuffling motions with his
feet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, he took in a deep
breath, and looked me straight in the eye.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'>"Hi, Daria," he said,
simply enough, though his voice trembled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was nervously pale, bringing to my mind the time when I had
reciprocated his dating invitation, but since this time he was the one showing
up unexpectedly at the door, he looked a little less befuddled.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Only a little, though.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'>"How . . .?" was all I
could say at first, then the answer became very clear.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I turned to find Jane standing behind
me, grinning like the Cheshire cat, and about as mischievous.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'>"Hey, you're college
students," she said, as though that made it obvious.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"No information about you is private.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Or me, either, now, I suppose."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane looked to be nearly jumping for
glee, though I couldn't tell if she was laughing with me or at me.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With me, I hoped, though I wasn't
laughing yet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'>"Jane e-mailed me," James
said, "which I must say was quite a shock."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He chuckled nervously.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Anyway, she told me what had happened with your father.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm so sorry, Daria; that's really
horrible."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'>"Thanks," I mumbled, but
was too blown away by the suddenness of it all to say more than that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'>"She told me I should come
over," he continued.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I have to
admit, I didn't want to at first; I was pretty mad.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But as she filled me in on everything that happened, all my
anger started to seem really . . . petty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was all so insignificant compared to what you're going through, and I
felt like an absolute jerk trying to find excuses to stay mad at you.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By the end, I was more worried that you
would be mad at me for how I acted, too mad to want to be friends again.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And I really think that I'm ready to be
your friend again, Daria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I </span>want<span
style='font-style:normal'> to be your friend again."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'>I looked back and forth
between Jane and James, and then Jane mouthed one word at me, before
disappearing into her room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Opportunity<span
style='font-style:normal'>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And I
suddenly realized what she was doing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She was showing me that, while I had been mourning missed opportunities,
not all of those opportunities had to stay missed.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Here was one where, thanks to her, I had the chance to pick
up those pieces and glue them back together; it might be a while before the
glue dried, and until then it would probably be fragile, but I had a chance to
make this relationship whole again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Here was my first step towards tearing down that wall, staring
expectantly at me from across a doorframe; my first opportunity regained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal'>Lose a father, but gain a
friend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It wasn't a fair trade,
not even close.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But it didn't have
to be; James was not intended to be a replacement for my father, not some weak
attempt at consolation, but a whole new relationship to be explored, if I had
the courage to pursue it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was
frightened, terrified that I would screw it all up again and inflict more pain;
but James seemed willing to take the risk, and I realized that this was one of
those times where I would have to act first, and worry later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
