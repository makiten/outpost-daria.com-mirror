<P>The Torture of Chalk Dust</P>



<P>Scene I - LHS, hallway</P>



<P>We see Jane and Daria walking down the hall.  They stop in

front of<BR>

Daria's locker.  Both look very hot.</P>



<P>Jane (wipes her brow):  Boy, it's hot.  When do you think the

air<BR>

conditioning will be back?</P>



<P>Daria(shrugs): I don't know, I asked Ms. Li and she just told

me she's<BR>

working on it. (Daria shuts her locker and they resume walking)</P>



<P>Jane: Great, what happened to the AC anyway?</P>



<P>Daria: I guess Ms. Li tried to get just one more surveillance

camera<BR>

placed on the power grid and it blew out a compressor.</P>



<P>Jane: Good to know she has our well being firmly in mind.</P>



<P>Daria: Isn't it though?  Oh look, the fashion drones haven't

melted<BR>

yet.</P>



<P>Daria nods in the direction of the Fashion Club who are standing

in<BR>

the hallway, talking.</P>



<P>Stacy: I hate this heat.</P>



<P>Sandi: I agree, sweat is so unfashionable.</P>



<P>Tiffany: Yeah.</P>



<P>Sandi: Quinn, what did Ms. Li say when you asked her about

when the<BR>

air conditioning would return?</P>



<P>Quinn: She said she was working on it.</P>



<P>Sandi: And she didn't say when?</P>



<P>Quinn: If she had I would've said so.</P>



<P>Sandi: Gee Quinn, there's not need to be so snippy.</P>



<P>Quinn (contrite): I'm sorry Sandi, it's the heat talking.</P>



<P>Tiffany:  I didn't know heat was a ventriloquist. (The rest

of the<BR>

Fashion Club stares at Tiffany for a long moment)  What?</P>



<P>Sandi (ignoring Tiffany):  After school today we will be holding

an<BR>

emergency meeting to discuss ways to beat the heat.</P>



<P>Daria and Jane walk past</P>



<P>Daria: Be careful, their hair spray might combust from the

heat</P>



<P>Jane: We can only hope.</P>



<P>Daria: Although it would be just as entertaining to just watch

them<BR>

melt like Barbies left out in the sun for too long</P>



<P>Quinn: Daria, ewww!  Why don't you go away or something.</P>



<P>Daria:  And miss out on your wit and wisdom?  No, wait, that's

already<BR>

missing.</P>



<P>Jane: You'd better go look for it.</P>



<P>Sandi: Uhm, Quinn's cousin, or whatever, could you like move

along<BR>

please.  You're geekiness is blocking out cuteness.</P>



<P>Daria: Ask me if I care.</P>



<P>Stacy (hesitantly): Uhm, do you care?</P>



<P>Daria:  No.</P>



<P>Stacy: Oh, then why did you ask?</P>



<P>Daria (to Jane): Sometimes the best defense is to remain oblivious.</P>



<P>Jane: Yes their deflector shields are on full</P>



<P>Sandi: Stacy, would you please stop talking to the geeks, you're

only<BR>

encouraging them.</P>



<P>Stacy: Oh!  Sorry Sandi.</P>



<P>Sandi (ignoring Daria and Jane): Now then, I propose we ask

Ms. Li to<BR>

turn the sprinklers on low so we can enjoy a nice cooling mist

between<BR>

classes.</P>



<P>Stacy: But wouldn't we get all wet?</P>



<P>Sandi: The wet look is in Stacy, besides it's either this,

or sweat.<BR>

(They all shudder)</P>



<P>Quinn: Oh Sandi, you always come up with the most innovative

ideas.<BR>

(Quinn looks unconvinced about the scheme)</P>



<P>Sandi:  I know.</P>



<P>Sandi, Stacy and Tiffany walk off leaving Quinn standing near

Daria<BR>

and Jane.</P>



<P>Daria: I know I'm going to regret asking this question, but

why do you<BR>

put up with crap like that?  This scheme of hers is asinine, the<BR>

sprinklers don't have a &quot;mist&quot; setting.</P>



<P>Quinn (haughty): Well Daria, it's like in judo.  When the large

man<BR>

charges, it's like, the small, wise man who steps aside.</P>



<P>Jane: Who told you that nugget of wisdom grasshopper?</P>



<P>Quinn: I read it on a fortune cookie.</P>



<P>Daira: Screw the little judo man.  That's stupid because the

big man<BR>

is going to take you down with him when he talks Ms. Li into turning<BR>

on sprinklers.</P>



<P>Quinn (flustered): Yeah, well Sandi will get soaked.</P>



<P>Jane (bemused): I'm confused are we talking about judo men

or Sandi?</P>



<P>Daira (calmly): And so will you, back to the drawing board.</P>



<P>Quinn: Ooohhh! (Quinn stomps off)</P>



<P>Jane: That was fun</P>



<P>Daria (shrugs): I just hope I remembered my umbrella</P>



<P>They walk to class</P>



<P>Scene II - O'Neill's classroom.</P>



<P>Jodie sits down next to Brittany, she notices that Brittany

looks<BR>

extremely haggard and like she hasn't slept at all.</P>



<P>Jodie: Hey Brittany, what's wrong?</P>



<P>Brittany: Oh, Kevy and I were up all night watching scary movies.</P>



<P>Jodie: Oh yeah, which ones?</P>



<P>Brittany (concentrating): Uh Nightmare on Friday the 12th,<BR>

Thanksgiving, Allen and Allens, Francula, and some others.</P>



<P>Jodie (nods after deciphering Brittany's confused babble):

 Yeah,<BR>

those are all good movies.  So what's the problem?</P>



<P>Brittany: I hadn't seen any of them before.</P>



<P>Jodie: You've never seen a scary movie?&quot;</P>



<P>Brittany (shaking her head emphatically): Nope, my dad didn't

let me<BR>

after I got nightmares from seeing the Wizard of Oz when I was

five.</P>



<P>Jodie (nods in a knowing fashion): Ahh, the Wicked Witch?</P>



<P>Brittany: No, Toto!</P>



<P>Jodie looks at Brittany like she's sorry she even brought it

up and<BR>

faces the front of the class.  Kevin walks up behind Brittany

and puts<BR>

his hands over her eyes.</P>



<P>Kevin: Guess who Babe.</P>



<P>Brittany (freaks out): EEP! (She flails her arms wildly, connecting<BR>

with Kevin's groin.)</P>



<P>Kevin: Oof! (He takes a step back) Good thing I was wearing

my cup. <BR>

(He looks at Brittany a moment) Say babe, those movies didn't

scare<BR>

you or nothing, did they?</P>



<P>Brittany (gulping): No, they didn't. (Fakes her usual perkiness)</P>



<P>Kevin: Great, then tonight we can watch a few more.</P>



<P>Brittany: There are more?</P>



<P>Kevin: That's the spirit, yeah there are always sequels, the

killer<BR>

never dies you know.</P>



<P>Brittany (terrified): Eep, uh, I mean, I can't wait Kevy.</P>



<P>Kevin (oblivious to Brittany's obvious distress): Great, these

ones<BR>

are even gorier than the movies we saw last night.</P>



<P>Jodie (noticing the green cast to Brittany's face): Uh Kevin,

why<BR>

don't you sit down now.  I think class is about to start.</P>



<P>Kevin: Oh, ok...(He turns for his desk, only to spin around

quickly). <BR>

Booga booga!</P>



<P>Brittany: Eeeeee!</P>



<P>Jodie sighs</P>



<P>Scene III - hallway</P>



<P>Daria is walking to her next class.  Along the way she passes

Upchuck.<BR>

 As Daria walked in front of him Upcheck steps in Daria's path

and<BR>

sweeps her into a deep kiss.  When the come up for air Daria looks<BR>

into his eyes lovingly.</P>



<P>Daria: Oh Charles, my entire life has merely been prelude to

that<BR>

kiss.</P>



<P>Upchuck: As was mine my sweet, but we cannot act on our love,

the<BR>

world is not ready for it (They stare at each other dramatically).</P>



<P>Daria: No, that kiss ha stirred passions long buried in me.

 I cannot<BR>

deny these feelings for you.  Come, take me Charles, make me yours.</P>



<P>Upchuck: Ok. (He sweeps Daria off her feet and walks to the

janitor's<BR>

closet)</P>



<P>We suddenly hear a loud popping sound and the scene dissolves

to<BR>

reveal a very pissed off Daria staring at Upchuck.</P>



<P>Daria: Upchuck, move your ass or I'll move it for you.</P>



<P>Upchuck (still lost in his fantasy): Grrrr, fiesty. (he moves

out of<BR>

her way.)</P>



<P>Daria looks at upchuck strangely and continues on her way.</P>



<P>Scene IV - classroom</P>



<P>Mack and Brittany are standing in a deserted classroom.  It's

dark and<BR>

flashing red lights bathe the room in an weird red glow.  Mack

is<BR>

holding a futuristic rifle and some sort of instrument.</P>



<P>Mack(anxious):  Multiple contacts, three meters.</P>



<P>Brittany:  Where are they?  What did we forget?</P>



<P>Mack (Hefts the rifle in his hands):  Two meters, one metere,

they're<BR>

on top of us.</P>



<P>Brittany:  The air ducts!</P>



<P>Suddenly vast numbers of Kevins drop from the ceiling, snarling

and<BR>

growling.  They surround Mack and Brittany in an ever shrinking<BR>

circle.</P>



<P>Jodie (v/o): Brittany?</P>



<P>We again hear the popping sound and the scene dissolves back

to a<BR>

classroom.  Brittany looks around.</P>



<P>Brittany:  What?</P>



<P>Jodie:  Class is over.</P>



<P>Brittany: Oh, good. (She stands)</P>



<P>Jodie: Are you sure you're ok?</P>



<P>Brittany (forcing a smile): Never better</P>



<P>Jodie sighs and the two leave the classroom.</P>



<P>Scene V - hallway</P>



<P>Daria and Jane are walking down the hall.  Quinn steps in front

of<BR>

them.</P>



<P>Jane: Run, it's a drive-by makeover!</P>



<P>Daria:  What do you want Quinn?</P>



<P>Quinn: I've been thinking Daria...</P>



<P>Jane: Is it even worth commenting on an opening that big?</P>



<P>Daria: Not really, after a while it stops feeling fair.</P>



<P>Quinn (ignoring them):  And I still think you're wrong about

how I<BR>

should have handled Sandi this morning.</P>



<P>Daria: Obviously.</P>



<P>Quinn: See, the way I figure it the only way Sandi will learn

anything<BR>

is if she tries and has it blow up in her face. (She crosses her

arm<BR>

in satisfaction)</P>



<P>Daria (sighs): And what lesson would that be?  That turning

on<BR>

sprinklers is a bad idea?</P>



<P>Quinn (hesitantly): Uhh, yeah.</P>



<P>Daria: Or maybe you're just looking for a way to embarrass

Sandi.</P>



<P>Quinn (shocked): Why Daria, would I be capable of doing something

that<BR>

petty?</P>



<P>Daria and Jane (in unison): Yes.  (They start to walk off.)</P>



<P>Quinn:  Yeah, well, You're wrong, I'm not!  Hmph, lousy no

good Daria,<BR>

why does she always have to be doing crap like that to me, it's

not<BR>

freaking fair.  (Quinn walks off, muttering to herself)</P>



<P>Scene VI - library</P>



<P>Jodie is sitting in the library.  No one else is there.  She

looks<BR>

down at her appointment book, it's blank.  She leans back in her<BR>

chair, closes her eyes and sighs contentedly.</P>



<P>The peace is broken by a beeping watch.  We hear the popping

sound as<BR>

Jodie's eyes snap open.  She looks down at her now packed appointment<BR>

book then sighs.</P>



<P>Jodie: Oh hell, I'm late.</P>



<P>Jodie gathers her things and hurries out of the library.</P>



<P>Scene VII - hallway</P>



<P>Upchuck is again walking through the halls in between classes

when he<BR>

sees Stacy primping in front of her locker.  Upchuck confidently

walks<BR>

over to her and sweeps her into a deep kiss.</P>



<P>Stacy (after they come up for air.):  Oh Charles, my life up

until now<BR>

has merely been pre...prelind...</P>



<P>Upchuck (smoothly): Prelude my sweet.</P>



<P>Stacy:  Prelude to that kiss.  I knew it was prelude, how stupid,

of<BR>

me. Stupid, stupid, stupid.</P>



<P>Upchuck: Don't beat yourself up over it precious.  For we cannot

act<BR>

on these feelings, it is taboo.</P>



<P>Stacy (confused): You've got a tattoo, ewww!</P>



<P>Upchuck (unperturbed): Not tattoo, taboo, forbidden.</P>



<P>Stacy: No, it can't be forbidden, because my feelings for you

are,<BR>

like, too strong, and if I can't act on them I'll just explode,

so<BR>

they can't be forbidden because I don't want to explode, but what<BR>

other choice do I have if I can't act on my love you Charles...(Stacy<BR>

begins to hyperventilate)</P>



<P>Upchuck: Hush my sweet, come I'll make it all better.</P>



<P>Stacy(v/o): Uhm, Upchuck?</P>



<P>The scene disappears with a loud pop and we're left with Upchuck<BR>

standing in front of an uncertain Stacy.</P>



<P>Stacy:  Er, Upchuck, would you like, mind moving, you're really<BR>

creeping me out.</P>



<P>Upchuck( (leering): Certainly my sweet, anything for you.</P>



<P>Stacy (in a panic): Oh my god, I hope no one hear you say that

they<BR>

might think I like you, which I don't because you're Upchuck,

but who<BR>

knows what people think...Eeeeee! (Stacy runs away)</P>



<P>Uphuck (to himself): Oh yeah, she digs me.</P>



<P>Scene VIII - cafeteria</P>



<P>We see Mack eating his lunch by himself.  Suddenly a large<BR>

African-American man sporting an afro walks up to Mack's table.

 Mack<BR>

looks up</P>



<P>Mack: Hey Huey, how's it going?</P>



<P>&quot;Huey&quot;: It's going brother, mind if I eat with you?</P>



<P>Mack: Go right ahead man.</P>



<P>&quot;Huey&quot; sits down.  Tow more black men and a woman,

walk up.</P>



<P>Mack: Hey Cesar, Riley, Jazmine.  What's up?</P>



<P>&quot;Riley&quot;: Keeping it real as always.</P>



<P>&quot;Cesar&quot;: Yo man.</P>



<P>&quot;Jazmine&quot;: Mind if we have lunch with your.</P>



<P>Mack: Not at all, plenty of room.</P>



<P>The three newcomers sit down and start eating.</P>



<P>Mack: You know what I like about this school?  There are some<BR>

minorities here.  My old school was nothing but white people.

 Don't<BR>

get me wrong, I have nothing against them, but sometimes it's

nice to<BR>

have some folks of color around.</P>



<P>&quot;Huey&quot;: I hear that.</P>



<P>Mack: There was this one kid who kept insisting on calling

me<BR>

&quot;Mack-Daddy,&quot; can you believe that?</P>



<P>&quot;Riley&quot;: Fool was asking for a beat down if you ask

me.</P>



<P>&quot;Cesar&quot;: No doubt.</P>



<P>Jaime (v/o): Hey Mack.</P>



<P>The scene dissolves with a pop back to Mack sitting alone.

 Jaime is<BR>

standing next to him, tray in hand.</P>



<P>Jaime: Hey Mack, mind if I sit here?</P>



<P>Mack (forcibly pleasant):  Sure Jaime.</P>



<P>Jaime (shouting over his shoulder): He says it's ok guys.</P>



<P>The remainder of the lily-white football team converges on

the table.</P>



<P>Kevin: Hey Mack-daddy!</P>



<P>Mack stares at his tray sadly and sighs.</P>



<P>Scene IX - cafeteria</P>



<P>Daria and Jane are sitting at a table in the cafeteria eating

lunch<BR>

when Quinn enters the room.  She scans the cafeteria and sees

Daria<BR>

and Jane.  She starts to talk confidently towards them.</P>



<P>Jane (noticing Quinn): Uh-oh, don't look now but we've got

an inbound<BR>

bogey.</P>



<P>Daria: Don't worry, we've got anti-aircraft guns, right?</P>



<P>Jane: Actually, no.</P>



<P>Daria: Crap.</P>



<P>Quinn: Ok Daria, I've thought about it some more, and yeah,

I want to<BR>

show up Sandi, but so what?  She's too full of herself and needs

to<BR>

learn some humility, it'll do her some good.</P>



<P>Daria (sighs): But aren't you still benefiting from her misfortune?</P>



<P>Quinn: Uh sort of.</P>



<P>Daria: So isn't the point still your personal gain and not

some<BR>

altruistic effort to make Sandi a better person.</P>



<P>Quinn: No...but...you see...Ohhhh (Quinn storms off)</P>



<P>Jane: You know that's a total load of crap, right?</P>



<P>Daria (nodding): Sure I do, but do you want to tell Quinn that?</P>



<P>Jane: An excellent point amiga, what was I thinking?  (The

duo resumes<BR>

eating their lunches)</P>



<P>Scene X - library</P>



<P>Brittany is walking through the library.  She sees Upchuck

asleep in<BR>

one of the reading chairs.</P>



<P>Brittany: Hey Upchuck, wake up, you're going to be late for

class.</P>



<P>Upchuck does not stir.</P>



<P>Brittany (growing nervous): Uhm...Upchuck?  Get up.</P>



<P>Upchuck still does not move</P>



<P>Brittany (becoming frantic): Upchuck, why won't you wake up?</P>



<P>Brittany pokes him with a nearby yard stick.  Upchuck's head

lolls to<BR>

one side, but he does not wake up.  Just then a miniature Kevin

comes<BR>

traipsing in.  In place of his football uniform he is wearing

a red<BR>

and white striped shirt and denim overalls.  Though he is still<BR>

wearing his shoulder pads underneath that.</P>



<P>Kevin (Cheerfully): Upchuck's not going to wake up...ever!

 I, like,<BR>

killed him!</P>



<P>Brittany: Kevy, how could you?</P>



<P>Kevin (unapologetic): Come on babe, it's Upchuck</P>



<P>Brittany: Still Kevy, that's not right.  Upchuck's a person

too, sort<BR>

of.</P>



<P>Kevin (sighs): Gee babe, I guess that means I'm going to have

to kill<BR>

you too.  (He produces an impossibly large knife from behind his

back)</P>



<P>Brittany (shocked): Eep!  Kevy, No!</P>



<P>Upchuck (v/o): grrr.</P>



<P>The scene vanishes with a pop and we see the now awake Upchuck

staring<BR>

at Brittany.</P>



<P>Upchuck: What a delightful way to wake up.  Though I would

like it if<BR>

you didn't stare at me so.  You nearly scared me half to death

when I<BR>

woke up.  So, do you want to go somewhere a little more private

where<BR>

I can show you more of my manly physique?</P>



<P>Brittany: Ewwww! (She runs away)</P>



<P>Upchuck stands up and walks to the door.  Halfway there a drop

dead<BR>

gorgeous blonde girl walks by.  From out of nowhere music swells

and<BR>

Upchuck sweeps the girl into a passionate kiss.</P>



<P>Girl (speaking with a French accent): Oh, my entire life up

to this<BR>

moment has merely been prelude to that kiss.  Tell me, what is

your<BR>

name?</P>



<P>Upchuck: Upch...err Charles.  And you are?</P>



<P>Girl: Jeanette, it is French.</P>



<P>Upchuck: Oui, I know.</P>



<P>Li (v/o):  Mr. Ruttheimer!</P>



<P>There's a pop sound and the scene shifts to Upchuck and Li

standing in<BR>

the library.</P>



<P>Li: Mr. Ruttheimer you are late for your class, get a move

on.</P>



<P>Upchuck starts walking to the door.  Suddenly the girl from

his dream<BR>

walks past.</P>



<P>&quot;Jeanette&quot; (still speaking with an accent): Hello,

can you help me? <BR>

I'm new and I don't know where my next class is.</P>



<P>Upchuck(stunned): Yes, uh, sure, I'd be delighted.</P>



<P>Li: What's keeping you Mr. Ruttheimer?  (Sees &quot;Jeanette&quot;)

 There you<BR>

are Jeanette.  Let me take you to your next class.</P>



<P>Upchuck (plaintive): But Ms. Li, I'd be happy to show her to

her next<BR>

class.</P>



<P>Li (angrily): Mr. Ruttheimer, if you do not go to your proper<BR>

classroom this instant you'll be suspended for insubordination.

 (to<BR>

Jeanette) Come along dear, your class is this way.</P>



<P>Li and Jeanette exit the library, leaving behind a stunned

Upchuck. <BR>

He sobs for a moment at the unfairness of the whole situation

before<BR>

walking to his next class.</P>



<P>Scene XI - Art room</P>



<P>Jane is standing in front of an easel in the art room, putting

the<BR>

finishing touches up o a painting.</P>



<P>Jane (looking satisfied): Another fine Jane Lane Original,

ready for<BR>

the world to ignore. (she frowns slightly)</P>



<P>Ms. Dafoe walks up behind Jane.</P>



<P>Dafoe:  Oh Jane, how wonderful, I think this is one of your

finest<BR>

pieces, so dark, so foreboding.  It sucks the view in totally.</P>



<P>Jane: Thanks Ms. Dafoe.</P>



<P>Dafoe: Jane, I showed a few of your pieces to a friend of mine

who<BR>

runs a gallery in New York.  She was amazed by your work and wants

to<BR>

do a show of your material.  In fact she's so convinced you're

going<BR>

to be famous she wants to purchase your entire collection and

then set<BR>

up distribution rights for all your subsequent works.</P>



<P>Jane:  Gee, that's great news!</P>



<P>Dafoe: Also she's willing to put you up in a studio of your

own so you<BR>

can focus entirely on your art.  You can leave Lawndale behind<BR>

forever.</P>



<P>Jane: Great!  When do I go?</P>



<P>Dafoe: Right now if you want.</P>



<P>Jane: Alright!  Adios suckers! (Jane starts to run out of the

room)</P>



<P>Dafoe (v/o): Jane?</P>



<P>Predictably the scene pops out and returns to the art room.

 Jane is<BR>

still standing in front of her painting, with paint dripping off

her<BR>

brush onto the drop cloth at her feet.</P>



<P>Jane: Uh, yeah?</P>



<P>Dafoe: This is very good Jane, very dark and foreboding.</P>



<P>Jane: Thanks Ms. Dafoe.</P>



<P>Dafoe: Oh, Jane, I showed a couple of pieces of yours to a

friend of<BR>

mine who runs a gallery.</P>



<P>Jane (eagerly): And?</P>



<P>Dafoe (sadly):  I'm sorry Jane, but even people in the art

world got<BR>

get pieces every now and then.  Maybe in another couple of years<BR>

everyone else will catch up with you.</P>



<P>Jane (sighs): Yeah</P>



<P>Dafoe (cheerily): Still, this is a good piece.  (She walks

off leaving<BR>

Jane behind)</P>



<P>Jane: Damn, it happened again. (She angrily slaps her brush

on the<BR>

painting.  She looks at what she's done). Aw hell.</P>



<P>Scene XII - hallway.</P>



<P>Quinn is walking down the hall when she sees Daria and Jane

standing<BR>

in front of a locker.  She pauses as if unsure, but straightens

her<BR>

shoulders and continues on, walking past her sister.</P>



<P>Daria: Oh look, it's the princess of the strappy shoe.  Have

any more<BR>

nuggets of wisdom for us?</P>



<P>Quinn (angrily): You know Daria, just because you're smarter

than most<BR>

people doesn't give you the right to insult them.</P>



<P>Daria: Of course it does.</P>



<P>Quinn: Yeah well, you're a big meanie who's ugly and nobody

likes you<BR>

because of that.  So shut up and leave me alone!  Why should I

care<BR>

what you say if you don't care what you look like?</P>



<P>Daria (shocked): I have no response to that it's all true.</P>



<P>Daria runs off crying.  All the other students in the hall

start<BR>

applauding Quinn's action.  Suddenly we see newspaper headlines,

like<BR>

in old movies.  &quot;Quinn reduces Daria to tears!&quot; one

reads.  &quot;Quinn<BR>

sharpest tongue in Lawndale!&quot; says another.  Quinn on the

cover of<BR>

waif with the caption, &quot;Quinn Morgendorffer: She's cute and

smart.&quot;</P>



<P>Daria (v/o): Quinn?</P>



<P>The scene pops and shifts back to Quinn, Daria, and Jane standing

in<BR>

the hall.</P>



<P>Quinn (distracted): What?</P>



<P>Daria: You looked like you were going to say something and

I was<BR>

wondering when to expect an utterance.</P>



<P>Quinn (flustered): Ohh, you're a big, friendless loser who's

mean<BR>

because nobody likes you!</P>



<P>Daria: Then what about Tom?</P>



<P>Jane: Yeah, or me. (Jane wraps an arm protectively around Daria.)

<BR>

There's just something about Morgendorffers...</P>



<P>Quinn (comprehending): Eww!  (Quinn runs away in horror)</P>



<P>Daria: Get your hands off of me.</P>



<P>Jane: Alright, sheesh, would it kill you to show a little appreciation<BR>

to the person who scared your sister off.</P>



<P>Daria: You're right, thank-you, now don't do it again.</P>



<P>Quinn walks back up to them.</P>



<P>Jane: Damn, that was strangely ineffective.</P>



<P>Quinn: I remembered you two like to do stuff just to freak

me out, but<BR>

you never really mean it.</P>



<P>Daria (sighs): Look Quinn you don't have to validate to me

how you<BR>

deal with Sandi.  I do my best to actively avoid her to cut down

on<BR>

the time we're in close proximity.  So do what you think is beset,<BR>

don't do what I think you should.</P>



<P>Quinn:  Gee thanks Daria!  (She once again walks away from

Daria and<BR>

Jane.)</P>



<P>Jane: Wow, that was easy, why didn't you do that sooner?</P>



<P>Daria (shrugs): And spoil all our fun?</P>



<P>They walk to class.</P>



<P>Scene XIII - Hallway</P>



<P>Daria and Jake walk past Ms Li in the hall.  Li is sitting

on a<BR>

toolbox in front of a service closet.</P>



<P>Daria: Uh Ms. Li, when will the air conditioning be working

again?</P>



<P>Li (angrily): It will be fixed when I get it fixed, and not

a moment<BR>

sooner.</P>



<P>Daria:  Why don't you just hire a repairman to fix it?</P>



<P>Li: Because it's a simple enough problem, there's no need to

hire an<BR>

expensive repairman to fix a twenty cent part.</P>



<P>Daria:  But why is it still broken if it's so simple?</P>



<P>Lie sighs and takes a remote control out of her pocket.  She

points<BR>

the remote at Daria and pushes a button. Daria's entire body slumps,<BR>

as if she's been turned off.</P>



<P>Jane: Hey, what did you do to Daria you psycho-bitch?</P>



<P>Li says nothing, instead she points the remote at Jane and

zaps her<BR>

too.  Like Daria, Jane suddenly slumps and is quiet.  Li pushes<BR>

another button and all the students in the hall come to a stop.

<BR>

DeMartino walks out of his classroom and sees the inactivity in

the<BR>

hall.</P>



<P>DeMartino: And just how much did this new toy cost you Li?</P>



<P>Li: Oh do be quiet Mr. Demartino.</P>



<P>Li zaps DeMartino while his eye is in mid-bulge.  Li walks

up to the<BR>

immobile teacher and takes a screwdriver out of her pocket.  She

opens<BR>

a door in the back of DeMartino's head and fiddles around inside

it. <BR>

She repeats the process on Daria and Jane then presses a different<BR>

button on the remote.  Everyone in the hall snaps awake, only

now with<BR>

an audibly mechanical sound.</P>



<P>Li (haughtily): You were saying something about the air conditioning<BR>

Ms. Morgendorffer?</P>



<P>&nbsp;</P>



<P>Daria (contrite): Oh no, you're much more knowledgeable in

these<BR>

matters.  I'd never contradict you Ms. Li.</P>



<P>Li: That's what I thought, and as for you DeMartino, go and

bring me<BR>

an Ultra Cola!</P>



<P>DeMartino: Of course, whatever you desire Empress Li! (DeMartino

walks<BR>

away mechanically.)</P>



<P>Li: Oh, replacing all the students and teachers with mechanical<BR>

simulacrums was a stroke of genius.  No more discipline problems,

no<BR>

more labor disputes, nothing to deny Lawndale High its proper

glory.<BR>

(She laughs maniacally.)</P>



<P>Kevin: Hey Ms. LI, when are you going to replace me with a

robot?</P>



<P>Li: Soon Kevin, the parts are due to arrive later today.</P>



<P>Kevin: Cool!</P>



<P>Li: Yes, cool is right.  Today Lawndale High, tomorrow the

world!  (Li<BR>

resumes her maniacal laughter.  Kevin joins in.)</P>



<P>DeMartino (v/o): Ms. Li!</P>



<P>We hear a loud pop and the scene dissolves back to the hall

all the<BR>

former robots are standing around Li staring at her.</P>



<P>Li: Yes, what is it?</P>



<P>DeMartino: I was wondering when you'd get off your authoritarian

ass<BR>

and call a repairman to fix the air conditioning!</P>



<P>Li (defensive): I'm working on it.</P>



<P>DeMartino: No, you aren't.  You're sitting on a tool box staring

off<BR>

into space.</P>



<P>Li (standing):As your superior I don't have to take this abuse!</P>



<P>DeMartino: Then try doing your job! (DeMartino walks off.)</P>



<P>Li:  Could you get me a delicious and refreshing Ultra Cola?</P>



<P>DeMartino (o/s): Get your own damn soda!</P>



<P>Li (looking around at the students who watched the exchange):

All of<BR>

you get to your classes, now!</P>



<P>The students slowly walk away.  Ms. Li angrily stalks off to

her<BR>

office.</P>



<P>Scene XIV - classroom</P>



<P>DeMartino walks into his classroom after his confrontation

with Ms. Li<BR>

in the hallway.</P>



<P>Brittany: Hey, look everybody, it's Mr. D!</P>



<P>Kevin: Cool, how you doing Mr. D?</P>



<P>Jodie: Hi, Mr. DeMartino.</P>



<P>Daria: Hello Mr. DeMartino.</P>



<P>DeMartino (cheerily): Good afternoon class, I'm doing quite

well, all<BR>

things considered.  Now Kevin, I hope you haven't forgotten our<BR>

agreement.</P>



<P>Kevin: Sure haven't Mr. D. (Kevin reaches under his desk and

withdraws<BR>

a gag, which he puts on, then flashes a thumbs up.)</P>



<P>DeMartino (grinning): Excellent, now class, who wants to hear

about<BR>

the Berlin Airlift?</P>



<P>Brittany: Actually could you tell us more of your cool stories?</P>



<P>Jane: Yeah, who cares about the Berlin Airlift, tell us more

about<BR>

your life Mr. D, now that's interesting history.</P>



<P>DeMartino (feigning modesty): No, really we have to study the

Berlin<BR>

Airlift today.</P>



<P>Mack: Please Mr. DeMartino?</P>



<P>DeMartino:  Well, alright, there was one time I was in Atlantic

City,<BR>

and I was up 30,000 dollars in craps...(the students all lean

into pay<BR>

closer attention.)</P>



<P>Daria (v/o): Mr. DeMartino?</P>



<P>The scene dissolves with a loud pop and DeMartino is left standing

the<BR>

door to the classroom.</P>



<P>Daria: Uh Mr. DeMartino, if you don't want me in the class

all you<BR>

have to do is say so.</P>



<P>DeMartino: Oh, pardon me Ms. Morgendorffer.  Far be it from

me to<BR>

block your academic progress.  (DeMartino lets Daria pass and

he walks<BR>

up behind his desk.)  Good afternoon class. (The class ignores

him. <BR>

DeMartino grits his teeth.)</P>



<P>Jane (whispering): Is it just me or has everyone been acting

weird<BR>

today?</P>



<P>Daria: I don't know, with these people how could you tell the<BR>

difference between today and every other day?</P>



<P>Jane (shrugging): Think about it, you sister, DeMartino, Ms.

Li, they<BR>

all have acted pretty space, not to mention that Brittany has

been<BR>

jumping at the sight of her own shadow all day.</P>



<P>Daria: What are you saying?  That there's a gas leak and everyone

is<BR>

hallucinating?</P>



<P>Jane: I wish, I'm just saying this heat is making it hard to

think<BR>

straight.</P>



<P>Daria: it's not that hard, just a matter of concentration.

 Although<BR>

given this bunch that is a little too much to ask for.</P>



<P>DeMartino clears his throat to get the class's attention.</P>



<P>DeMartino: Ok you miserable bunch of reprobates, who can tell

me about<BR>

the Berlin Airlift?</P>



<P>Instantly all the hands in the room shoot up.</P>



<P>DeMartino (smiling): Well now, who to pick, Kevin?</P>



<P>Kevin:  The Berlin Airlift was, like, when the Soviets tried

to starve<BR>

out West Berlin, but the US was all like, &quot;no way, you can't

do that!&quot;<BR>

 So we, like, flew in all sorts of food and stuff until the Russians<BR>

gave up.</P>



<P>DeMartino: Very good, now does anyone wan to tell me what the<BR>

ramifications of the airlift were?  (Again everyone in the class<BR>

raises their hands.)  Brittany, can you tell us?</P>



<P>Brittany: Uhm, well, the Berlin Airlift helped freeze relations<BR>

between the US and the Soviet Union, and that's why it's so hot

today,<BR>

because the Cold War thawed!</P>



<P>DeMartino:  Close enough.  Now, Ms. Morgendorffer...(louder)

Ms.<BR>

Morgendorffer!</P>



<P>The scene vanishes with a loud pop and resolves back to DeMartino's<BR>

classroom.  Daria looks up suddenly.  She sees DeMartino staring

at<BR>

her angrily and that Jane is looking at her with an amused expression.</P>



<P>DeMartino: I ask again, Ms. Morgendorffer?</P>



<P>Daria: Uh, yes?</P>



<P>DeMartino: Ah good, I see that I finally have your attention.

(Jane<BR>

snickers.)  Now, none of your classmates hve shown any interest

in<BR>

telling us why we should care about the Berlin Airlift, perhaps

you<BR>

would like to let us know, unless you're too busy staring at the

wall!</P>



<P>Daria (sighs):  The Berlin Airlift was started when the Soviets

cut<BR>

West Berlin off from the rest of the world.  The US managed to

fly in<BR>

enough supplies to convince the Soviets to lift the blockade.

 It was<BR>

one of the first flashpoints in the Cold War and signaled the<BR>

beginning of declining relations between the United States and

the<BR>

Soviet Union.</P>



<P>DeMartino:  Thank-you Daria, now may I recommend that you pay

closer<BR>

attention to me for the rest of class.</P>



<P>Daria: Yes, Mr. DeMartino.</P>



<P>DeMartino turns his attention to the rest of the class.  Jane

leans<BR>

over to talk to Daria.</P>



<P>Jane (smug): Just a matter of concentration huh?</P>



<P>Daria (grumpy): Oh shut up..</P>



<P>Scene XV - classroom</P>



<P>Brittany is sitting at her desk.  The room is dark.  Suddenly

she sees<BR>

a shape appear in front of the classroom door.  The figure is

a human<BR>

silhouette.  Brittany swallows nervously.  Then the figure raises

a<BR>

large-bladed knife.</P>



<P>Brittany (terrified): Eep!</P>



<P>Brittany scrambles out of her desk and runs to the back of

the room. <BR>

The door opens and the figure enters the room, still enshrouded

in<BR>

shadow, knife raised.</P>



<P>Kevin (v/o): Hey babe, your stapler.</P>



<P>The scene pops out and we're left with Brittany cowering in

the back<BR>

of the classroom and Kevin standing over her, stapler in hand.</P>



<P>Brittany: Huh?</P>



<P>Kevin: Your stapler, you let me borrow it, remember?  Here

have it<BR>

back.  (He hands her the stapler.)</P>



<P>Brittany: Oh, ok, thanks.(She takes the stapler.)</P>



<P>Kevin: Say babe, want to go see some more scary movies tonight?</P>



<P>Brittany: Oh I don't know, I'm still pretty tired from last

night.</P>



<P>Kevin: Say, you weren't actually like, scared by those movies

were<BR>

you?</P>



<P>Brittany (meekly): Well yeah, a little, I guess they were just

too<BR>

much for me.</P>



<P>Kevin (teasing): Brittany's a fraidy cat!</P>



<P>Brittany (angry): Kevy! How dare you make fun of me.</P>



<P>Kevin (contrite): Sorry babe, come on, let me make out, er

make it up<BR>

with you.</P>



<P>Brittany (cheerfully): Ok.</P>



<P>Kevin drapes an arm over Brittany as the two walk out of the<BR>

classroom.</P>



<P>Kevin (Opening the door): After you babe.</P>



<P>Brittany: Oh, Kevy, that's so romantic.</P>



<P>Brittany walks out of the room.  Kevin stops and faces the

camera and<BR>

grins, his eyes starting to glow red.</P>



<P>Scene XVI - hallway</P>



<P>Quinn walks up to Sandi, Tiffany and Stacy, who are all standing<BR>

around Sandi's locker.</P>



<P>Quinn: Hey guys, going home?</P>



<P>Sandi: Well, school is over isn't it?&quot;  (They all start

walking down<BR>

the hall.)</P>



<P>Quinn (hesitantly): Uhm, Sandi, about that idea of yours involving

the<BR>

sprinklers.</P>



<P>Sandi: What about it?  I talked to Ms. Li about it and she

thought it<BR>

was a fantastic idea, naturally.  (hey come to a stop in front

of the<BR>

girl's bathroom.)</P>



<P>Quinn(shocked): She what?</P>



<P>Sandi (nonchalant):  She liked my idea, and said she'd turn

the<BR>

sprinklers on as we were leaving the school.</P>



<P>Quinn (looking up nervously at the sprinkler above her head.):

Gee<BR>

Sandi, that's great.</P>



<P>Sandi: Now what was it you wanted to tell me?</P>



<P>The door to the bathroom opens a fraction and Quinn feels something<BR>

being pressed into her hand.  She takes a hold of it, surreptitiously<BR>

glances down and sees she's been given an umbrella.</P>



<P>Quinn:  OH, well, it doesn't really matter anymore</P>



<P>Before Sandi can say anything in response the sprinkler's turn

on, at<BR>

full blast.  As the rest of the Fashion Club runs for the exit<BR>

shrieking Quinn simply raises her umbrella and smiles.  The door

to<BR>

the bathroom opens and Daria steps out, holding her own umbrella.</P>



<P>Quinn (smiles): I suppose I have you to thank for the umbrella?</P>



<P>Daria (shrugs): Among other things.</P>



<P>Quinn: Why?  (The two sisters walk down the deserted hallway.)</P>



<P>Daria:  I didn't see why you had to pay for Sandi's stupidity,

in this<BR>

case at least.</P>



<P>Quinn: You did this didn't you?</P>



<P>Daria: I can neither confirm or deny that assumption, but I'll

ask you<BR>

this.  Why on earth would Ms. Li approve such a stupid notion?</P>



<P>Quinn: But how?</P>



<P>Daria (smirks): I have my methods, but if I told you...</P>



<P>Quinn: You'd have to kill me.  Yeah, I get the point, but why?</P>



<P>Daria (shrugs):  It seemed like a good idea at the time, besides

if<BR>

takes a certain haughty fashion plate down a peg or two it can't

be<BR>

bad idea.</P>



<P>Quinn (astonished): But that's what I've been saying!</P>



<P>Daria (smirks): Yes, but I don't gain anything from embarrassing<BR>

Sandi, except for the satisfaction of a job well done.  Do as

I say,<BR>

not as I do grasshopper.</P>



<P>Quinn (chuckles): You just wanted to get Sandi soaking wet,

didn't<BR>

you.</P>



<P>Daria: There was that too.</P>



<P>The Morgendorffer siblings exit the school.</P>



<P>Scene XVII - Morgendorffer house</P>



<P>Jake walks into the living room of the Morgendorffer household.

 Daria<BR>

is sitting on the couch in front of a fan reading a book.</P>



<P>Jake: Hey kiddo, how did your day go?</P>



<P>Daria (without looking up from her book): The police are after

me for<BR>

a string of murders.  Quinn's pregnant and doesn't know who the

father<BR>

is, and Mom ran off with Eric Schrecter.</P>



<P>Jake (clutching his chest):  Gah!  (He keels over and falls

to the<BR>

ground dead in front of a disinterested Daria.)</P>



<P>Daria: Hmmm, dinner ala Jake tonight. (She stands up and drags

Jake's<BR>

corpse into the kitchen.)</P>



<P>We hear the now familiar pop and the scene resolves back to

Jake<BR>

walking into the living room.</P>



<P>Jake: Hey kiddo, how'd your day go?</P>



<P>Daria (without looking up from her book): I deny everything,

Quinn's<BR>

off with the Fashion Club, and Mom's working late.</P>



<P>Jake reaches for his chest then pauses.  He shrugs then puts

his arm<BR>

down,</P>



<P>Jake: So, what kind of pizza do you want for dinner?</P>

<P>Come stumble my mirth beaten worker<BR>

I'm Jezmund the family berzerker<BR>

I'm bought for the price of a flagon of rice<BR>

The wind buffs the cabin, you speak of your life<BR>

Confuse what you can of the ending<BR>

And revise your despise so impending<BR>

'Cause I soak on the wrath that you didn't quite mask<BR>

I'm getting it clearly through alternate paths<BR>

Or mixed in with the signal you're sending<BR>

But who can unlearn all the facts that I've learned<BR>

As I sat in their chairs and my synapses burned<BR>

And the torture of chalk dust collects on my tongue<BR>

Thoughts follow my vision and dance in the sun<BR>

All my vasoconstrictors they come slowly undone<BR>

Can't this wait till I'm old? Can't I live while I'm young?<BR>

But no peace for Jezmund tonight<BR>

I plug the distress tube up tight<BR>

And watch what I say as it flutters away<BR>

And all this emotion is kept harmless at bay<BR>

Not to educate somebody's fright<BR>

<P>Alter-Egos:</P>



<P>In honor of this 'episodes' heritage the alter-ego's are a

touch<BR>

different.  Instead of the Daria cast in different roles we see

the<BR>

cast of NewsRadio dressed as Darians.</P>



<P>Dave Foley as Daria:  complete with glasses, jacket, boots,

skirt, and<BR>

wig.</P>



<P>Maura Tierney as Tom, wearing Tom's gray turtleneck, khaki

cargo pants<BR>

and sneakers.</P>



<P>Phil Hartman as Upchuck, Phil is wearing Upchuck's traditional<BR>

buttoned down shirt and a leer.</P>



<P>Andy Dick as Kevin, in full pads.</P>



<P>Khandi Alexander as Jodie, wearing Jodie's short skirt and<BR>

blouse...and a pushup bra.</P>



<P>Joe Rogan as Mack, Joe is dressed in Mack's usual garb, though

the<BR>

sleeves have been cut off the shirt, and a dreadlock wig.</P>



<P>Steven Root as Jake, business suit and a martini glass.</P>



<P>Vicki Lewis as Quinn, Vicki is dressed in Quinn's Season Four<BR>

wardrobe, though the shirt bares much more midriff.</P>



<P>Brad Rowe(Cousin Walt) as Jane, Walt is wearing Jane's traditional<BR>

attire...and a black wig.</P>



<P>Author's Notes: Yes, this is a shameless homage, French for

stealing,<BR>

of the classic NewsRadio episode, &quot;Heat Wave.&quot;  I even

went so far as<BR>

to steal...er, reference specific segments of the NewsRadio episode,<BR>

If you've seen the show than you know what I'm talking about.</P>



<P>Where'd this come from?  The idea for the story came about

when I was<BR>

listening to the song Chalk Dust Torture by Phish.  Initially

I was<BR>

thinking about an interminably long class with O'Neil, then I

hit on<BR>

making it in a heat wave, then I figured &quot;why not do the

News Radio<BR>

episode.&quot;  At which point I realized that having it take

place in one<BR>

class session wouldn't be feasible so I had to open up the scope

to<BR>

include an entire school day.</P>



<P>Where's Dave?  Yeah, there's no Dave Wylie, or any other<BR>

author-created character, in this one, that's by design, I wanted

to<BR>

do a &quot;straight&quot; Daira fan-fic, just for fun, so I gave

Dave and Ian,<BR>

et al. a little vacation.</P>



<P>Reasons behind the Alter-Egos:</P>



<P>Dave -&gt; Daria:  In both shows these characters are the nominal

voices<BR>

of sanity.  Plus, Dave Foley, as a former KITH, knows a thing

or three<BR>

about performing in drag.  Thought it must be admitted that Dave<BR>

Nelson is a tad more neurotic than Daria, and a bigger alcoholic.</P>



<P>Maura -&gt; Tom:  I had some debate over this one.  Lisa Miller

doesn't<BR>

quite map to Tom.  But considering the history between Dave and

Lisa I<BR>

had a hard Tim having Maura play Jane.  Also Lisa is the only

other<BR>

&quot;sane&quot; character on NewsRadio, just like Tom on &quot;Daria&quot;

sort of.</P>



<P>Phil -&gt; Upchuck:  Bill McNeil and Upchuck shared a similar

mindset in<BR>

how to attract women.  Upchuck lacks Bill's pomposity and<BR>

adequivaquacity, but I still think it's a good match.</P>



<P>Andy-&gt; Kevin: The show's respective idiots.</P>



<P>Khandi -&gt; Jodie: Do I have to explain why?</P>



<P>Joe -&gt; Mack:  No real reason beyond Joe having a thing for

Catherine. <BR>

Plus my choices were either Mack or Kevin and Mack seemed like

a<BR>

better fit.</P>



<P>Steven -&gt; Jake:  Really this is a no brainer, in fact, if

I were<BR>

casting a live action Daria, I'd definitely have Steven Root high

on<BR>

my list to play ole Jakey.</P>



<P>Vicki-&gt; Quinn:  So many choices, could've used Brittany,

could've used<BR>

Stacy.  I chose Quinn because they both have red hair, both have

a<BR>

flair for the dramatic, and both bare their navel.  Also one of

the<BR>

hot theories on al.tv.newsradio was that Jimmy was really Beth's<BR>

father, and what will Jimmy as Jake it just fit.</P>



<P>Walt -&gt; Jane:  I had to include Jane in here somewhere and

by using<BR>

Walt, who appeared in a fair number of episodes, and was sort

of<BR>

romantically linked with Lisa...I could put another cast member

in<BR>

drag.</P>



<P>Yes, this leaves out a lot of Daria characters, but I ran out

of<BR>

WNYXians to use.  Yes, I didn't use max Lewis, or Johnny Johnson,

but<BR>

nobody really fit them, and I like to forget about the last season

of<BR>

NewsRadio.  Not that the episodes were bad, just because it was

the<BR>

last one, sot it's a bittersweet thing more than a critique of

the<BR>

quality of the season.</P>



<P>So that's &quot;The Torture of Chalk Dust,&quot; just a fun

little piece of fluff<BR>

I felt like writing, nothing more nothing less.  Hope it amused.</P>
