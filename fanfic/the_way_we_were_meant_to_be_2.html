The Way We Were Meant To Be, Part Two


Standard disclaimer applies. This is the second out of ? parts to this story,
but bear with me.


Part two, chapter one: Common ground


Quinn sat in her room, having just awoken from a nightmare where an injured
Daria was torn from her arms in a storm. She woke up drenched in a cold sweat,
and sat at her dressing table awhile, thinking about how stupid she had been.
Things like "Is it too late to change?" and "Why can't I be smart like Daria"
were racing through her head. She thought back to when she was little,
remembering how she and Daria had almost always fought. She also thought about
the good times, when she knew everything would be okay, because she was small,
and not too bright, and Daria was big and strong. At least to her. She came to
a startling revelation: Daria DID love her. In her own way. She encouraged
Quinn, stood up for her, defended her, and offered her wisdom. But she was no
fool. Quinn couldn't con her into doing her homework for shallow reasons. She
had to really need help to get it.

Never the less, Daria was always there for her. In her own smart,
unintentionally superior, sometimes slightly mocking way. There she was for
her, and their parents, too. Quinn could remember saying "Come on, Daria, were
sisters," and she remembered the feeling of nervousness, trying to turn their
familial bond against her to get what she wanted. But Daria was too smart for
that. "Never in public" or something was her reply. Then Quinn had another
insight: Daria was ashamed that her sister was shallow and not too
intelligent, when she was the opposite, deep and brilliant. Quinn had never
thought either of them could compete on that front, until she wrote that
essay, and the guys came to pick up a mirror-image-of-Quinn, Daria. She got a
look of determination on her face, and went to her closet. It was 3:45 am.

When Quinn got downstairs at four, she witnessed Daria sharing a private
emotional setion by the window, as she watched the sun beginning to shed it's
rays of dawn.

Quinn: Did I really think something that pointlessly poetic? Nah.

This she said quietly, but Daria heard her, anyway, and turned around.

Daria: Quinn, what are you doing up? Don't you need your beauty sleep?

She spat the last phrase bitterly. Quinn recognized the special tone she used,
and noted that Daria wasn't jealous. She was just upset with Quinn for not
knowing her own sister better.

Quinn: Daria, I'm sorry. It's just that we can't seem to find common ground. I
saw you with that guy from Jane's house and immidiatley my brain went into
overdrive, automatiocally thinking that if we had guys in common, we must have
all things guy-related in common. I AM sorry.

Daria: I accept your apology, Quinn, but please don't underestimate me like
that. I know that deep down you realize that there isn't much we have in
common. Imagine what it'd be like if we were twins.

Quinn laughed, recognizing Daria's sense of humor, as well as the trueness of
it. I'd be pure hell for them AND everyone else. Daria smiled.

Daria: Quinn, we DO have common ground.

Quinn: What is it?

Daria: Humor.

Quinn realized immidiatly that it was true. They DID have humor in common.

Daria: Come on, Quinn. Let's go to bed.

Quinn: Can I sleep in your room? I had a nightmare.

Daria: Sure if you can stand it.

They went upstairs.


Part two, chapter two: What went on


Quinn and Daria entered Daria's room, and sat on the bed.

Quinn: Wow, your bed is comfy!

Daria: If you sleep on a thrift-store matress, you'll feel the same effect.

Quinn: Why do you have a thrift store matress?

Daria: Well, mom and dad kinda didn't notice when I dragged the other one out
and threw it away. I had to pay for a new one, and I wasn't willing to give up
$300.00 of my Montana Cabin Fund to pay for something mom and dad should have,
so I took $20.00 and bought an old one.

Quinn: What's this Montana Cabin Fund thing?

Daria: Oh, it's kind of a joke. I was thinking about saving up and moving into
a secluded cabin in the moutains in Montana. I know now that I have more than
that to live for, so this is just my life savings now.

Quinn: How much do ya got in it?

Daria: Promise not to tell? I've got about as much as dad makes in a year.

Quinn counted on her fingers, and then stared at Daria, astounded. Dad made
over $60,000.00 in a year. Daria smiled.

Quinn: So, what did you and Trent do on your date?

Daria: Well, we went on a picnic that Upchuck interupted, first. Trent and I
talked about the future. You know, jobs we'd like to have and whatnot. Then,
we went to Lawndale county fair. The rides were awsome. There was this giant
roller coaster, and we almost fell out! Trent saved me, though. My seatbelt
was a little loose.

Quinn: Why was it loose? Don't they strap those things in?

Daria: I glared at the attendant because he hit my head with the seatbelt.

Quinn: Oh. I thought it was because of... um...

Daria: What? Ooohhhhh. I get it. Cuz everyone thinks I'm flat. News flash,
sister. Don't you remember when I dressed up like you?

Quinn: Oh, I thought it was those bust thingies.

Daria: In truth, and don't take this the wrong way, I have a better figure
then you. It's just because I'm a year and a half older.

Quinn: Remember that wedding? Why didn't the dress fit?

Daria: Well, my figure was less adequate then, and the seamstress was an
ignoramus.

Quinn: Huh?

Daria: Ignoramus: the Latin form of ignorant. Traslation: moron.

Quinn: Oh. Well, I suppose so. I mean, I know how you feel about these kinds
of things. To tell you the truth, I agree with you on many subjects. It's
like, Sandi, Stacy, and Tiffany are my friends, but only if I'm nice to them.
And they're so stupid sometimes.

Daria: I must admit, you wowed me with your scientific knowledge when I had
that rash. I mean, some of those words are hard for even ME.

Quinn: Yeah, I like science.

Daria: Maybe because science is what creates makeup?

Quinn: Yeah. But makeup isn't shallow. It helps you make a good impression on
people. I have real friends, and I made them when I made a godd impression.
Remember before we left Highland, I went to that camp for awhile? Well, there,
they taught me how to make a good impression, and ways to influence people,
and it was fun.

Daria: I suppose so. I DO like clothes shopping. I just like different
clothes. I also don't spend ALL my time shopping. I do schoolwork, because I
want to get into a good college. I'm thinking about maybe Harvard. Some of my
teachers think that's possible.

Quinn: I'll bet Ms. Morris isn't one of them.


Part two, chapter three: Buggin me, bonding with me


The two talked awhile longer. Eventually, they started to reminisce.

Quinn: Hey, Daria, who WERE you with that time that mom went crazy and tried
to ground us for a month?

Daria: Um, I was with Jodie and Mack.

Quinn: No way! You're friends with them? Jodie and Mack are the coolest
achievers there are. And Mack is hot! Jodie is SO lucky to have him. You're
lucky to have Trent, Daria. And I like having Matthew.

Daria: Yeah, who is that Matthew who you keep talking to?

Quinn: My boyfriend. A steady one. The other guys I just keep around to take
me places, cuz Matt's  car is in the shop. I don't even slow dance with them,
and I tell them it isn't a date, and they still say it is. I'm thinking of
ignoring them all.

Daria: That's the thing about dating. You can lose a great guy to a
misunderstanding of intent.

Quinn: Boy, do I here that.

Daria: It's fun talking to you, Quinn. We have more in common then people
think.

Quinn: We should do this more often. Maybe with Jane, too. You're lucky to
have such loyal friends.

Daria: Sure, and you're lucky to be so friendly. I'm a lot like Amy. Or so
I've noticed.

Quinn sat thinking for awhile, while Daria cranked Offspring's "Feelings," and
then "Falling," and then "The Kids Aren't Alright," All angst-filled songs.
Quinn sat up straight.

Quinn: I'm quitting the fashion club. I've decided I don't need them to be
popular. I already have a boyfriend, and the FC is just cutting into dating,
shopping, and studying time.

Daria: Are you sure about this? I mean, even though you COULD survive without
them, you wouldn't have excuses for coming in late, or the right to date as
much...

Quinn: I'm sure. I know there could be consequences, but none so great as not
being able to talk to my only sister. You have so much to say, and it's fun to
be with you. I think of all I've missed, and all I could, and I don't like
that.

Daria: I really DO have a sister. No more of that cousin, who's parents are in
jail business anymore?

Quinn: None of that ruining all my fun business?

Quinn and Daria: Agreed.

The two bonded sisters fell asleep at the foot of Daria's bed. That's where
Helen found them the next morning.


Part two, chapter four: Apologies and changes


Helen walked into Daria's room, intending to chew her out, but what she saw
melted her heart. Quinn and Daria were curled up side by side at the end of
Daria's bed, holding hands. Helen backed out and went downstairs, where Jake
was cooking breakfast. She prepared a tray and took it silently up to Daria
and Quinn. Jake, curious, followed her, and ruined his own breakfast in the
process. Helen set the tray by Daria and Quinn, smiled, and walked out, teary
eyed. Jake followed and held his wife's hand. Quinn and Daria woke up a few
seconds later to a delicious breakfast of waffles and bacon and orange juice,
which both ate with gusto. They got up, and Quinn left, leaving Daria to
change. Both walked downstairs fully dressed.

In the kitchen, Jake and Helen were eating breakfast and smiling.

Helen: Daria, I'm sorry I underestimated your principals and motives.

Daria: Mom, I'm sorry I blew up at you for it.

Quinn: Ending awkward moment now.

She walked to the fridge and grabbed some more orange juice. There was a knock
at the door. Quinn and Daria opened it to see the fashion club.

Daria and Quinn, both coldly: Oh, it's YOU.

Quinn: I quit.

Daria slammed the door in their faces and went upstairs calmly, leaving Jake
oblivious, Helen confused, Sandi angry, Tiffany noncomital, and Stacy bawling.

Quinn and Daria sat in Quinn's room by the mirror.

Quinn: I never did get to see you with contacts.

Daria removed her glassed and stared at Quinn.

Quinn: Daria, you look so pretty without them. Why don't you look into laser
surgery or something?

Daria: There are risks involved. I have a 90%  chance of improvement if I do.

Quinn: Oh, do it.

Daria: I'll think about it.

She pulled up a box on her lap and put her contacts in. Quinn grabbed a
compact and opened it.
