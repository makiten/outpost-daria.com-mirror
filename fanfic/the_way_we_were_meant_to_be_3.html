The Way We Were Meant To Be, Part Three


Standard disclaimer applies. Read parts one and two first, or you'll never
understand it.


Part three, chapter 1: Test bunny


Daria sat in front of Quinn's makeup table, covered in glop. Quinn had wanted
to see what Daria would look like in makeup, and Daria had decided to indulge
her. Now she was removing the makeup with goop that would supposedly make her
skin better. Quinn giggled at Daria's negative reaction. Daria wiped the rest
of the goop of and went to wash her face. She noticed that the few pimples on
her forehead were gone, and her skintone was less sallow, but other than
that... Daria went to her room and opened up her closet. She changed out of
her shirt, which now had little bits of powder on it, and into an identicle
one. The phone rang.

Daria: Hello.

Jane: Hi. Where were you yesterday? Trent was gone, too.

Daria: Oh, really? I was on a picnic with Trent. We went to the fair
afterwards.

Jane: You realize I'm never gonna let this go, right?

Daria: I know. Well, Quinn and I are on better ground now. She and I had a
spat last night, and she apologized and we ended up bonding. She's decided to
give up the fashion club and all those guys, cuz she has a steady boyfriend
now.

Jane: Wow! Your life is sure changing fast.

Helen: Daria, I need the phone!

Daria: Okay mom. Bye, Jane.

Jane: Later.

The two hung up, and Helen picked up the phone downstairs. Daria turned on the
computer and began to type.

Daria: Hm. Well, I guess sooner is better than later. In this case, anyway.


Part three, chapter two: Jobwalker the hut


Daria walked through the mall, utterly disgusted. She had spent the whole week
looking for a good job, and had been rejected everytime. As she walked past
the foodcourt, she saw one more help wanted sign. At Pizza Hut. She sighed and
walked in. She walked out an hour later with a uniform, and a job schedule.

Daria: Great.

She walked into her house to see Helen get off the phone.

Helen: Daria, we're going on vacation! I decided to cash in all my vacation
time at once and get us away for the entire summer.

Daria: Ugh. Mom, I just got a job today at Pizza Hut, for the entire summer.

Helen: But Daria, don't you need my signature?

Daria: Got dad's, and anyway, I'm seventeen and a half, so legally I can get a
job.

Helen: Why'd you get your fathers signature instead of mine?

Daria: He was the closest parent, and I knew you'd turn it around on me and
not let me have a job.

Helen: Darn right I would, and... ooops.

Daria: Ooops is right. I start monday.


Part three, chapter three: I want to get away


Daria sat and almost pouted. Her way to make money was gone. Helen had called
Pizza Hut and told the manager that Daria didn't have total parent permission.
Now she had to suffer through a summer with Helen. On vacation. Pleading with
her mother, and using the fact that she needed money didn't help. Suddenly she
had an idea. She snuck back up to her room.

In her closet there was a duffel bag, which she pulled out. She took all her
clothes out and looked at them. People would recognize her. She put in her
contacts and pulled her hair into a bun. Then she changed into a blue teeshirt
and black flared jeans. Her appearance was totaly different. She liked the
look. Makeup was easy with Quinn's tips. She chose pink lips and blue eyelids
as her color combo. She brushed her bangs back and clipped them down with blue
and silver butterfly clips. She put the rest of her clothes in the bag and
started to climb out the side window. When she got to Quinn's room and looked
in, she noticed that Quinn wasn't there, and the door was open. She climbed in
a grabbed a few basic outfits that Quinn wouldn't miss. All she had to do was
act older, and lay low until winter, and she'd be fine. She planed this all
out as she walked to the all-night versatellar machine.

Her account was full: She had $15,000.00. She took it out into checks, with
the name "Adrian Moore" as hers. She then headed toward the library, which was
still open. She hid her bag, went in, and checked out a book on identity
alteration. Inside she found all the clues to legaly change all her info,
almost overnight. The only clues she left were the empty closet and an empty
account.

Jane's door was unlocked, so she went in. Jane was sleeping, light snoring
emited from under her door.

Daria: Jane!

Jane snorted and rolled over, so Daria grabbed her shoulders and shook.

Jane: Wha... Flummm... Jussa sec... Daria? That you?

Daria: No, it's Diana's reincarn. Yes it's me! I'm running away.

Jane: Why?

Daria: I'm being forced to give up my job and my freedom. Mom wants me to
spend my last summer as a minor with the family, although it would be more
sensible to let me work. Plus, she's been getting on my nerves lately. I'm
gonna crack under all this pressure.

Jane: Wait, stay here for a few days. You can stay in mom's bomb shelter.
There's only one legal key, I made the duplicate. I can bring you food. Best
to lie low for a week or two until the police will calm down. Come with me.

Jane led Daria outside to the bomb shelter in the back yard. Inside, there was
a cot, and some shelfs. Daria set her stuff down, lay on the cot, and promptly
fell asleep.
