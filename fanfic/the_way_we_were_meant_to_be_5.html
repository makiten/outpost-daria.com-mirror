The Way We Were Meant To Be, Part Five


Part Five, chapter one: Pain, Pain, Go Away


Daria awoke to find herself draped by a sheet, and pain surged up her leg. She
squirmed a bit, and a nurse came over.

Nurse: Daria, do you remember what happened?

Daria: I saw Quinn go under, and dived in after her. I don't remember anything
after that.

Nurse: You pulled Quinn out of the water and saved her life. She and you were
bitten by shark, and you got hit with poison jellyfish on top of that. Quinn
got out with a broken leg, but you... Well, we couldn't save your right leg.

Daria stared at the nurse in fear, as she slowly glided her hand down her
right leg, to find the end to be just above her knee. Her face fell, as the
nurse propped the back of her bed up. Quinn wheeled in, unaware of what
happened to Daria.

Quinn: Hey Daria. What's wrong?

Daria: Ah...

She bit her quivering lip, as she patted the stump that was so recently her
leg.

Quinn: Oh NOOOO! You took a shark bite that cost you your leg to save me, and
I didn't even deserve it. I've been a rotten brat, and haven't even thought of
your feelings once this vacation.

Daria: Quinn, I know you love me, and that's all the reason I need to dive
into a pit of rabid bulldogs for you.

Quinn lay her head on Daria's bed and fell asleep there.


Part five, chapter two: da da da da da da da problems


Daria lay again in agony, as the doctor forced her to get up and complete the
rounds. She was in physical therapy, and this was the last day. Quinn has
escaped this torture, and was giving the nurse no end of trouble because she
forced Daria to suffer. Daria couldn't pull herself up. Quinn, wheeling by in
her wheelchair, saw this, and pulled her up, helping her into a nearby chair.
She turned back to the physical therapist.

Quinn: Bitch! Stupid whore! My sister suffered for me. I wont let her suffer
for your sadistic whims. She's been through enough, you shithead.

Daria was pale and breathing heavily. She screamed and fainted. Quinn got out
of her chair, and stumbled to help Daria into the emergency room, while the
medics looked on in awe.


Part five, chapter three: Boy was that short!


Daria woke up with Helen and Jake leaning over her.

Jake: Daria, you had a heart attack! You're marked for the tomb!

Helen: Jake, get a grip! She had a severe palipitation, due to over exertion.
I'm gonna get that bastard physical therapist.

Daria: Where's Quinn?

Helen: Oh, she hurt leg a little getting you in the ER. She's resting in the
other bed.

Daria: When are we getting home?

Helen: Well, We have another month left, but I want you to get back to
Lawndale and start up your new routine.

Daria: Okay.

Just then, Quinn bobbed her perky head up from the other bed and looked
around.

Quinn: What time is it?

Jake: Five thirty, Kiddo!

Quinn: Ohmygosh! I have a date with the ambulance attendant in thirty minutes!
I gotta get ready.

She pulled her curtain tight around her bed and tried vainly to get ready.


Part five, chapter four: Gonna go, gonna go a go a go away a!


Daria sat in her seat in the airplane, hoping the flight attendants wouldn't
spill anything on her. Her hope was in vain, as a blue clad lady got
crannberry juice on her jacket. She glared up at her, and the gal, about to be
snooty, saw her leg, and bowed out quietly. Daria smiled smugly to herself, as
Quinn giggled. Then Quinn's pager beeped, and she picked up her phone, dialed,
and chated away. A few seats ahead of them...

Helen: I wonder how Daria will adapt to this?

Jake: What? Oh, well she's always been used to being mocked. I don't think
things will be much different, sept she'll have Quinn to help her now.

Helen frowned, not wanting to admit that her usually oblivious husband was
right. She sighed, and turned on her side, trying to go to sleep.


Part five, chapter five: Jane o' the pitytree


When they got back into Lawndale, Jane was doing yardwork for Helen. She
hailed and walked over, looking strangly, as Quinn got out, ran around, pulled
out a wheelchair, the one she used before she got the walking cast. Daria
opened her door, and Jane blanched as she saw one leg, instead of two, use the
wheelchair as a walker, to get to the door.

Jane: GOD! What happened Daria?

Daria: Four shark bites to my leg and two to Quinn's happened.

Jane: Sharks!

She got out a cell phone and called home.

Jane: Trent, Daria's back early.

She heard a yelp and a click, as Trent came over to see for himself.

Daria: Oh no! Jane, I can't let him see me like this! I don't have my
prosthetic on!

Jane: Huh?

Quinn answered for her, as Daria struggled inside.

Quinn: A fake leg.

Trent drove up a few minutes later.

Jane: Trent, she had her leg bitten off by a shark!


What will Trent do? How will Daria adjust her life? How will the peers react?
Will Daria and Trent run off into the woods to have a million babies, all of
which will look like Quinn, and have no leg? Well, no, to the last one, but
stay tuned to part five, the final installment of The Way We Were Meant To Be,
or The Destiny Series...
