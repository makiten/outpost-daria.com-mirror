<br>
Ms Li's office. Daria and Lynn looking at each other with identical looks of assessment and deadpan curiosity.<br>
<br>
Cullen house, exterior. A small, thin redhead in a blue flack-jacket and black jeans drops to his knees and begins to salaam to Daria and Lynn, who are peering out an upstairs window.<br>
<br>
LHS classroom. Daria, Jane and Lynn stand in a doorway, smirking. Jane carries a Polaroid camera.<br>
<br>
Lane house, exterior. Daria, wearing a white peasant blouse, green half-corset, black skirt and black cloak with green satin lining [no glasses] stares in shock at Lynn, who wears an identical outfit bar the colour of the cloak lining and half-corset [purple] and an equally shocked look.<br>
<br>
LHS corridor. Daria and Jane watched with bemusement as DeMartino drags a screaming Lynn past them by her ear.<br>
<br>
LHS gymnasium. On a stage rigged at one end, Trent rams his guitar through a bass drum.<br>
<br>
Science lab. The redhead, wearing safety goggles, pushes a button and ducks under the desk an instant before the model of Lawndale High that graces that desk blows up.<br>
<br>
LHS corridor. Daria, Jane, Lynn and the redhead watch, smirking, as Ms Li is dragged down the hall handcuffed to a policeman. A camera crew whose equipment bears the Sick Sad World logo follows behind them.<br>
<br>
Daria and Lynn side-by-side again, smirking slightly. As the original montage sequence, the camera pulls in and then out again to reveal two interlocking circles; one contains the Daria logo and the other contains a corresponding 'Lynn' version. Underneath are the words: "Daria in…"</i></p>
<p align="center"><b>RUN AWAY FROM HOMECOMING</b><br>
<br>
A Daria fan fiction – Episode 1:04 of the Look-Alike Series</p>
<p><i>(Scene: Lynn's room. Music: "We Care A Lot" by Faith No More. Jane is sketching; she seems to be a bit morose and embarrassed. Daria is on-line on Lynn's computer [ask me the make and I shoot you all]. Lynn is reading: "1001 Ways to Manipulate the Working Mother" and making notes in the margins in pencil.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> What's that URL again?<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> <i>(barely looking up from her book)</i> Subversion-underscore-is-underscore-we dot co dot UK forward-slash booklist – one word – dot html.<sup>2</sup><br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> <i>(turning around in her chair to face Lynn)</i> British?<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> <i>(waves pencil in the air vaguely; doesn't look up)</i> For the best in nonconformity and subversion, buy British. They have to be experts because they don't have a constitution or anything and the only rights they have are the ones the government hasn't taken away yet. Anarchy in the UK – as sung by the Sex Pistols – is alive and well. The punk movement started there, you know. <br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> <i>(smirking)</i> And once it got to the States…<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> <i>(still not looking up but smirking)</i> Can you say "sell-out", boys and girls? I knew that you could.<sup>3</sup><br>
<br>
<i>(Pause as Daria types in the URL and looks at the page. Jane looks a bit uncomfortable at the words 'sell-out' but says nothing.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> <i>(monotone)</i> If it wasn't so out of character for me, I would laugh with delight and jump for joy at what I am reading off this list of books.<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> <i>(little smile)</i> Good, isn't it. <i>(beat)</i> Hey, they're having a three-for-the-price-of-two sale on the '1001 Ways to Manipulate…' series. You might find something useful there.<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> <i>(smirk)</i> Like I haven't got enough practice at that already. <i>(reads)</i> Working mothers… <i>(beat)</i> radical feminists… <i>(beat)</i> fashion victims – ooh, I'll have to order that one… <i>(beat)</i> sensitive new-age men… <i>(beat – then, incredulously)</i> airport security personnel?<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> <i>(casual)</i> Select clientele.<br>
<br>
<i>(beat)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> Yeah, but "1001 Ways to Manipulate World Leaders"?<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> <i>(still casual)</i> VERY select clientele.<br>
<br>
<i>(Jane, looking more and more guilty by the second, finally looks up from her sketch. She surveys her friends for a moment, and then…)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> <i>(hesitant)</i> Um … guys?<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> <i>(mocking but friendly)</i> It speaks! <i>(beat)</i> And to impart a guilty secret, from the sound.<br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> <i>(more hesitant)</i> Ms Defoe asked me to design the junior class float for the homecoming parade.<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> <i>(small smirk)</i> Shame I missed that.<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> <i>(deadpan)</i> Yeah, right. Homecoming. Testosterone-fuelled propaganda-fest perpetuated by the school in the name of selling hot dogs at football games. Boola-boola for the home team. Rah-rah, sis boom blah.<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> <i>(thought VO)</i> Not "Sis-boom-bah-humbug"? I'm almost disappointed.<sup>4</sup> <i>(aloud)</i> So what sharp negation did you come up with to deter Defoe?<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> <i>(thoughtful)</i> I find that "when pigs fly" works, if you say it in JUST the right tone. Better than profanity by a wide margin, if you get the sarcasm levels right.<br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> <i>(sheepishly)</i> I said yes.<br>
<br>
<i>(There is a pause. Daria & Lynn look incredulously at Jane; it's obvious that they are desperately trying to think of something nice to say … or at least something inoffensive to say.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Daria & Lynn:</b> <i>(unison. flat)</i> Oh.<br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> <i>(defensive)</i> I know how twisted it sounds, okay? But I had no choice! Defoe found my Achilles Heel!<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> An intense, almost obsessive desire to display your creative abilities and have your unique brand of talent praised by the masses … be they ever so unwashed and uneducated?<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> A previously undeclared love of crepe paper in blue and yellow?<br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> <i>(angry; she's obviously known that this would be the reaction, but it still stings)</i> Knock it off! <i>(beat; quieter)</i> She said it would look good on any art school application if I did something creative for school. I mean, it's not like my 'Students at the Dawn of a New Millennium' poster will get any credit. And Quinn got credit for the Jackson Pollack theme to the school dance, so...<sup>5</sup><br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> <i>(monotone)</i> Of course. I understand.<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> <i>(monotone)</i> If it is your will that I do so, I shall cease my mockery.<br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> <i>(relieved)</i> Cool. <i>(beat)</i> Oh, hey, I've got to go. I promised Trent I'd wake him up this afternoon.<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> <i>(back to her book; fake casual but at least a little interested)</i> When did you last see Trent awake, out of interest?<br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> <i>(thinks)</i> Tuesday. I think.<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> <i>(smirk)</i> If I don't mock you, can I mock HIM?<br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> <i>(answering smirk)</i> I wouldn't do that if I were you. Daria has access to your computer and a clear line to reformat your hard drive if you mock her wannabe. <br>
<br>
<i>(Daria scowls but does not look up from the screen)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> <i>(casual)</i> Let her. It's just a few bits of software – easily reinstalled. And anyway, I've backed up all my irreplaceable work onto zip disc. A team of narcs tearing up my room wouldn't turn it up. <i>(beat)</i> Subversion_is_we's book of the month selection for July was "Hideaway – Places to Stash Incriminating Evidence That Even FBI Agents Wouldn't Suspect!" <i>(beat)</i> Best five bucks I ever spent.<br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> <i>(chuckles. She sounds a lot like Trent doing his laugh/cough thing.)</i> See you later. <i>(exit)</i><br>
<br>
<i>(There is a pause.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> <i>(still absorbed with screen)</i> Ouch.<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> <i>(still absorbed in book)</i> Yeah.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>(Scene: Science classroom. Ms Barch is pacing up and down at the front of the room, talking into a cell phone. Actually, more like screeching into a cell phone. Jane & Lynn are sitting with the rest of the class. Jane is doodling on the cover of her notebook with a bottle of white-out. Lynn is reading "Let's Get Pyromanic! A Do-It-Yourself Guide to Home-Made Firebombs!" We see there are two desks empty.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Barch:</b> What do you MEAN, you're paying less alimony? If you'd paid ANY attention to me over our TWENTY-TWO THANKLESS YEARS of marriage, you'd KNOW how little I make! Or is it just that you want more to spend on the little blonde TRAMP you call a WIFE?<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> <i>(immersed in book)</i> She is woman, hear her roar.<br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> <i>(caught up in doodle)</i> She is woman … see the blood flow as she tears her victim's head off.<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> <i>(matter-of-fact)</i> Humans spurt. In time to their dying heartbeat. It's an arterial thing. The carotid's a big one, too. If you get the carotid artery, blood spurts hard enough to hit the ceiling.<br>
<br>
<i>(beat)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> How can you know stuff like that – and read about bomb-making – and STILL have a C average in science?<sup>6</sup><br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> <i>(casual)</i> I only know science as it relates to torture. No school in the country will specialise in pain. <i>(beat; disappointed)</i> Believe me, I've looked EVERYWHERE.<br>
<br>
<b>Kevin:</b> <i>(looking around)</i> Hey, where's Mack Daddy? We're supposed to be talking about the game now!<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>(Scene: Highway somewhere in Lawndale. Looks peaceful … until the sound of a car accelerating fills the scene. Mack's car shoots by.)</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>(Scene: Car's interior. Mack driving, a madly frightened look on his face. Jodie is sitting beside him, looking no less panicked.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Mack:</b> Why'd you have to spend so much time at the library anyway?<br>
<br>
<b>Jodie:</b> Trying to decide between books on politics – to get Dad off my back – or books on economics – to get Mom off my back. Can't this heap go any faster?<br>
<br>
<b>Mack:</b> And the mall. We just HAD to stop at the mall, didn't we.<br>
<br>
<b>Jodie:</b> New SAT study guides are in. Had to get them.<br>
<br>
<b>Mack:</b> During lunch? They wouldn't still be there after school?<br>
<br>
<b>Jodie:</b> Look, just drive! <i>(beat; mutter)</i> If I'm late for Barch's class, my reputation will be ruined.<br>
<br>
<b>Mack:</b> You're lucky! If I'M late for Barch's class, she'll eat me alive! <i>(swerves into fast lane; narrowly misses clipping a bright yellow VW Beetle)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Jodie:</b> Watch out!<br>
<br>
<i>(Mack lays on the horn. HONK, HONK!)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Mack:</b> Get off the road!<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>(Scene: Science class again. Barch still "roaring".)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Barch:</b> Look, you despicable MALE, I don't know what you and that male chauvinist PIG you call a DIVORCE LAWYER have cooked up, but you're NOT going to get away with it! Now get OFF the line! I have responsibilities that I can't run from … not that YOU'D understand the concept!<br>
<br>
<i>(Switches off cell phone. All the boys in the class are wearing "we're in for it now" expressions.)</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>(Scene: Jodie & Mack are running down a corridor of Lawndale High.)</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>(Scene: Ms Barch's class. Class is staring at her.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Barch:</b> Right, class … we're going to have a little test. All those who fail it fail the quarter as well. Let's start with the girls…<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> <i>(raises her hand)</i> Excuse me?<br>
<br>
<b>Barch:</b> What is it, dear?<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> The bell hasn't rung yet.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>(Scene: Jodie sprints for the door of Ms Barch's class, with Mack hot on her heels.)</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>(Scene: Ms Barch's class. The instant before the bell starts ringing, Jodie bursts through the door of the room. Barch shuts the door before the bell stops ringing, hitting Mack in the nose.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Barch:</b> <i>(yells through door)</i> YOU FAIL! <i>(back to class, placid expression)</i> All right, now … Lynn.<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> <i>(sighs. She knows she won't get the right answer to anything Barch asks.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Barch:</b> Give me three ways to permanently injure a man, with complete and graphic physiological detail.<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> <i>(surprised and pleased expression)</i><br>
<br>
END ACT 1 – ADVERTS [Lead-in: Barch slamming the door in Mack's face.]<br>
<br>
ACT 2<br>
<i>(Scene: Pizza King. Music: "Zero" by Smashing Pumpkins. Jane looks a bit glum. Daria & Lynn wear their usual stoic expressions. They are picking at a plain cheese pizza.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> <i>(morose)</i> So Barch locks him out of the room and flunks him. He's lost his sports eligibility two weeks before homecoming. <br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> Then she asks me to give her three ways to permanently hurt a man. In graphic detail. She took notes all the way through.<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> So the Lawndale Lions have lost their captain. Who's taking his place?<br>
<br>
<i>(Enter Kevin and Brittany. Kevin looks proud and extremely pleased. Brittany does not look like her bubbly self.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Kevin:</b> All right! I'm the QB! AND I'm the captain too!<br>
<br>
<b>Brittany:</b> <i>(insincerely)</i> I'm proud of you, Kevvie. <br>
<br>
<b>Kevin:</b> Hey, what's wrong, babe? I mean, I know Mack Daddy can't play and that's pretty sad, but you're going out with the captain AND the QB! And no one can get jealous!<br>
<br>
<b>Brittany:</b> I AM glad, babe! It's just … are you SURE you're up to being captain AND QB? I mean, they're both SUCH big jobs and…<br>
<br>
<b>Kevin:</b> Aw, babe, I know what you're thinking.<br>
<br>
<b>Brittany:</b> <i>(surprised)</i> You do?<br>
<br>
<b>Kevin:</b> Sure, and don't worry. <i>(beat)</i> I'll have PLENTY of time for you!<br>
<br>
<b>Brittany:</b> <i>(sigh)</i> That's great, Kevvie. I … um … I just have to talk to Daria for a minute. She PROMISED to give me more art tips.<sup>7</sup><br>
<br>
<b>Kevin:</b> Sure, babe. Cheeseless?<br>
<br>
<b>Brittany:</b> You know me SO well, Kevvie! <i>(Kevin saunters away, & Brittany approaches Daria, Lynn & Jane)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> Living pudding alert.<sup>8</sup><br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> Wonder what she wants. I never promised her art lessons.<br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> Beats me.<br>
<br>
<b>Brittany:</b> Um … you three are, like, good at fooling people and stuff, right?<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> We are well-known for our prowess at the art of manipulation, subversion and deviation from the path of veracity. It is our raison d'être. <br>
<br>
<b>Brittany:</b> <i>(hair-twirling thing)</i> Huh?<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> Yes.<br>
<br>
<b>Brittany:</b> Oh, good. I was just wondering if you could … um … try to talk to Ms Barch and get Mack Daddy back as captain.<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> Why would YOU want Kevin to give up his position as quarterback AND captain?<br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> Yeah. I thought you'd be pleased that your boyfriend's gone up in the world.<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> That makes you even more popular, after all.<br>
<br>
<b>Brittany:</b> There's nothing sadder than a cheerleader cheering for a losing team. We'd be bigger losers than the football team if we lost! And … um … Kevvie's not really all that good at planning things.<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> And I thought that no one but her family doctor would ever hear her say that.<br>
<br>
<b>Brittany:</b> <i>(hair-twirling)</i> Huh?<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> Never mind. Why should we help you?<br>
<br>
<b>Brittany:</b> Um … I could pay you!<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> We do have SOME standards. <i>(beat)</i> When it suits us.<br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> How much?<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> Jane?<br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> Well, I don't want Lawndale to lose either. If I support the damn team with my float design, I want them to win.<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> Point taken. How much?<br>
<br>
<b>Brittany:</b> Um … I don't know … I'll tell you at lunch tomorrow if you promise you'll do it.<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> We'll consider it and get back to you when you've put a price on this bit of work.<br>
<br>
<b>Brittany:</b> Deal! <i>(bounces away)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> I didn't realise…<br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> What, that she had so little faith in Kevin?<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> No; that she knows how manipulative we are.<br>
<br>
<i>(enter Jodie, looking glum)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Jodie:</b> Hey, guys.<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> Hi, Jodie. Hey, where's Mack? Usually you two are joined at the hip when you're in here. <br>
<br>
<b>Jodie:</b> He won't come out. He's never failed anything before and it's really getting to him. That's why I'm here. I was hoping you two could help him get his sports eligibility back. <br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> <i>(to Lynn & Jane)</i> I'm feeling a strong sense of déjà vu here.<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> Why are you taking such an interest in this?<br>
<br>
<b>Jodie:</b> Because it's my fault. I talked him into taking me to the library and the mall at lunchtime. If I hadn't told him that I wanted to spend some more time with him, he NEVER would have been late for Barch's class.<br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> He wasn't. Barch shut the door before the bell stopped.<br>
<br>
<b>Jodie:</b> <i>(bitter)</i> Like that matters to her. The system sucks.<sup>9</sup><br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> That's the spirit.<br>
<br>
<b>Jodie:</b> So will you help him?<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> What's it worth to you?<br>
<br>
<b>Jodie:</b> Money?<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> We have ways of getting money. It's a last-resort option; what else have you got?<br>
<br>
<b>Jodie:</b> Money … and for you, Daria, a promise. No attempts to get you involved for extracurricular activities for the rest of the semester.<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> For the rest of my time at Lawndale High.<br>
<br>
<b>Jodie:</b> Until the end of spring break.<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> For the rest of my junior year. And no acceptance without negotiation of the cash fee.<br>
<br>
<b>Jodie:</b> Deal. I'll get what cash I can together and talk to you about it tomorrow at lunch.<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> We have a prior engagement during lunch. How about after school, same time and place?<br>
<br>
<b>Jodie:</b> All right. And thank you for at least considering doing this for me. <i>(exit)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> I think we've painted ourselves into a corner here, ladies.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>(Scene: Jane's room. Daria has a notepad and a pen. Jane is sitting cross-legged on the floor. Lynn has a copy of "1001 Ways to Manipulate the Radical Feminist".)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> Any ideas?<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> Well, it says here "In the situation where you are negotiating for a third party, blackmail never hurts. That way, even if there is a male somehow involved in the situation, the radical feminist has incentive to see things your way."<br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> But how can we blackmail Barch?<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> There's an entire section on "Hot and Heavy – The Feminist Libido". Seems to indicate that a feminist's sex drive is her weakest point.<br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> Who would have Barch, though?<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>(Scene: Ms Barch's room, night. Music: "With or Without You" by U2. Ms Barch is sitting at her desk, opening a bottle of champagne and pouring it into two coffee mugs. Enter O'Neill, looking nervous.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>O'Neill:</b> Are you sure we should be doing this? I mean…<br>
<br>
<b>Barch:</b> Of course we should. After all, we're supposed to enjoy our jobs <i>(mutter)</i> although how they can expect us to with all those testosterone-driven monsters is beyond me… <i>(back on the subject at hand)</i> And if our jobs don't fulfil us … at least when we look at our desks, we'll have the memories to make us smile. <i>(hands O'Neill a mug)</i> To us.<br>
<br>
<b>O'Neill:</b> <i>(smiles)</i> To us. <i>(they drink)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Barch:</b> <i>(tossing her mug on the floor, where it shatters)</i> That's enough of that. Come to mama, big boy…<br>
<br>
<i>(As seen in "The Daria Hunter" and "Fair Enough", Barch grabs O'Neill and pulls him down out of the shot. But they shoot back up again quickly when a flash goes off in their faces.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Barch:</b> What the hell…<br>
<br>
<i>(We are treated to a shot of the door, where Jane is standing with her Polaroid camera. Daria and Lynn flank her like a pair of bookends. They wear identical smirks.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> What did I tell you? You CAN believe everything you read.<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> We got what we came for.<br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> Bye. Carry on. <i>(all three exit)</i><br>
<br>
<i>(O'Neill and Barch look after the girls for a moment. Then O'Neill begins to cry.)</i><br>
<br>
END ACT 2 – ADVERTS [Lead-in: Daria, Jane and Lynn standing in the doorway, smirking.]<br>
<br>
ACT 3<br>
<i>(Montage sequence. [Sorry, but I LIKE them!] Music: "Sellout" by the Levellers.<br>
<br>
Lynn enters Ms Barch's class and drops her book bag onto Barch's desk. She pulls out a small roll of what looks like black leather. She unrolls it to reveal a set of tools. She takes one, eyes it critically, and then proceeds to pick the lock on Barch's desk.<br>
<br>
Daria's room. Daria lays the Polaroid of Barch & O'Neill on a flatbed scanner and pushes a button.<br>
<br>
In front of the Lane house. Jane looks critically at a sketch in her notebook. Then she looks at the Tank, upon which she has already built a wooden platform. Trent, Jesse, Nick and Max are standing behind her, seeming to await orders. Max looks distressed at what has been done to his van.<br>
<br>
Lynn sits at Barch's desk amid a litter of papers. In front of her is a laptop computer and a small scanner. She selects one at random and then puts into her scanner and pushes a button.<br>
<br>
Daria's room. The glare from the computer reflects off her glasses. We have a very vague image of O'Neill & Barch's faces, kissing, reflected on the glasses as well. Daria smirks.<br>
<br>
Jane strews a gold streamer over a bright blue tarp and looks at it for a moment. She seems to be struggling to hang it. She looks over her shoulder and sees Trent asleep on the kerb. She picks up a Nerf football [she's hanging lots of them all over her float like Christmas tree ornaments] and pegs it at her brother, who falls over and looks at her scathingly.<br>
<br>
Ms Barch's room. Lynn packs her bag, surveys the desk – as clear as when she entered – tests the drawers and smirks. Then walks out.<br>
<br>
End montage.)</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>(Scene: Faculty lounge at Lawndale. Ms Barch is ripping the heads off male action figures in a grim silence. There is a knock on the door.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Barch:</b> If you're female, come in! If not, stay out if you value your life at all!<br>
<br>
<i>(Enter Daria & Lynn.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Barch:</b> Well, well. What do YOU two want? And where's your camera-happy little friend?<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> <i>(ignoring the second question)</i> We'd like you to reconsider failing Michael Mackenzie and revoking his sports eligibility.<br>
<br>
<b>Barch:</b> Why should I do ANYTHING for that despicable MAN?<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> Out of the goodness of your heart?<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> Because you know that what you did was unfair and you would like to correct a grievous wrong?<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> Or maybe because we have enough evidence against you to have you brought before a school board tribunal. <i>(thought VO)</i> Send us fifteen pounds, please, Mrs Teal, and your husband need never know the name of your lover in Bolton. <i>(sly little smirk)</i><sup>10</sup><br>
<br>
<b>Barch:</b> Oh, you mean that little snapshot. I think you're bluffing. Polaroid pictures are notorious for giving bad likenesses – I bet I'm not even recognisable on it.<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> <i>(holding up the shot – we're still looking at Barch's face so we can't see it)</i> It's amazing how far technology has come since you were a girl.<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> And you've all but admitted you were on it.<br>
<br>
<b>Barch:</b> Your word against mine, girls.<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> <i>(holds up a Dictaphone)</i> Not anymore.<br>
<br>
<i>(she rewinds the tape – it makes that ghastly rewinding noise – and then presses play)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Recording:</b> Oh, you mean that little snapshot…<br>
<br>
<b>Barch:</b> Those things can be faked.<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> True … but computer scans are a little bit harder. <i>(pulls out a stack of papers and tosses them nonchalantly on Barch's desk)</i> These are your grade sheets for the semester. Note the distinct imbalance. All the girls are pulling really high marks, while the boys are barely passing ... if that.<br>
<br>
<b>Barch:</b> Men are known for their stupidity.<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> True … but Lynn's had a C average for years.<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> It's kind of a badge of honour for me now.<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> How's she doing in YOUR science class, Ms Barch?<br>
<br>
<i>(There is a pause. Barch's face goes through a variety of emotions – embarrassment, fear, anger … and then, finally, grudging acceptance and a little admiration.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Barch:</b> You girls know your stuff. What do you want out of me?<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> Mack's sports eligibility returned to him.<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> Give him the test you locked him out of last week. I'm pretty sure he'll pass it – if you're fair this time.<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> Then he'll pass the semester and get his sports eligibility back.<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> We're doing you a favour, you know.<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> If you let Mack fail, Kevin captains the Lawndale Lions in the homecoming game.<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> Imagine Ms Li's reaction to her school team being led by someone who could probably be outsmarted by his own shoulder pads.<br>
<br>
<b>Barch:</b> Point taken. <i>(beat)</i> Now get out of here.<br>
<br>
<i>(Daria & Lynn shrug at each other and leave.)</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>(Scene: Barch's class. Mack is about to leave the class behind the others when Barch stops him at the door.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Barch:</b> Michael!<br>
<br>
<b>Mack:</b> <i>(sigh; dismal resignation)</i> Yeah?<br>
<br>
<b>Barch:</b> You want to pass the semester?<br>
<br>
<b>Mack:</b> <i>(confused)</i> Yeah…<br>
<br>
<b>Barch:</b> Come by after school and I'll give you a make-up test for the one you missed last week.<br>
<br>
<b>Mack:</b> <i>(still confused, but pleased as well now)</i> Um … I'll be there! Thanks!<br>
<br>
<b>Barch:</b> And you'd better take it fast! <i>(beat)</i> You wouldn't want to miss another day of practice, now would you?<br>
<br>
<b>Mack:</b> <i>(shrugs)</i> Guess not. <i>(beat)</i> What made you…<br>
<br>
<b>Barch:</b> <i>(snaps)</i> Ask me questions and I reconsider the whole thing. I'm doing this against my better judgement!<br>
<br>
<i>(Mack smiles and leaves. Barch puts a hand to her head and groans)</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>(Scene: Pizza King. Music: "Basket Case" by Green Day. Jane, Daria and Lynn are picking at their traditional pizza.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> So how's the float coming?<br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> Pretty good, I think. I'm going for a more abstract approach than the others. The seniors have a big lion, the sophomores made a really big papier-mâché football, and the freshmen made a replica of the football field.<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> And you?<br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> I just put things representative of Lawndale's football experience. Footballs, shoulder pads, pom-poms, cheerleader underwear…<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> Tommy Sherman being crushed by a collapsible goal post?<sup>11</sup><br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> You know me too well. <i>(beat)</i> So how did "Operation Bag-a-Hag" go?<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> We're about to find out.<br>
<br>
<i>(Enter Brittany and Kevin. Kevin looks dejected. Brittany, however, is hiding a smile.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Kevin:</b> But it would have been PERFECT! I mean QB AND captain! Aw, man!<br>
<br>
<b>Brittany:</b> Oh, poor Kevvie; I still love you! <i>(as they pass, Brittany slips two envelopes onto the table between Daria & Lynn; whispers)</i> Thanks!<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> What did we decide on, price-wise?<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> $50. Each.<br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> Whoa! Does this mean that the Montana Cabin Fund is back on track?<sup>12</sup><br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> Looks like … if I don't spend it all at Subversion_is_we first.<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> It's addictive, isn't it.<br>
<br>
<i>(Enter Mack and Jodie. Both are wearing relieved smiles.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Jodie:</b> Hey, Daria. Hey, Lynn.<br>
<br>
<b>Mack:</b> I wanted to thank you for sticking up for me with Ms Barch.<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> How was your test?<br>
<br>
<b>Mack:</b> Not as hard as some of the others, actually. I think she's getting soft. <i>(takes out two envelopes. Jodie does the same)</i> Jodie said she was going to pay you, but I wanted to do my part as well. I don't know what you two did, but it must have been something.<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> <i>(taking her envelopes)</i> Happy to be of service. Oh, here's something for you. <i>(takes a disc out of her pocket and hands it over)</i> In case she ever gives you trouble again. Or, in the case of the jpegs, just for laughs.<br>
<br>
<b>Mack:</b> <i>(confused, but takes the disc)</i> Cool. <br>
<br>
<b>Jodie:</b> Thanks again, you two. <i>(exit Mack and Jodie)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> You two are beyond help, aren't you?<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> <i>(smirk)</i> And proud of it.<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> Was that copies of all the blackmail material we had on Ms Barch?<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> And one ace in the hole <i>(pulls out a piece of paper and hands it to Daria)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> <i>(wide eyed)</i> Where did THIS come from?<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> I installed a camera on a timer in Ms Barch's classroom before we arrived. Obviously things heated up after we left.<br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> Where was the camera?<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> Hidden in the chalk gutter of the blackboard. You can tell by the angle.<br>
<br>
<b>Daria:</b> How come they didn't notice?<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> <i>(produces a VERY small camera from her pocket)</i> THIS is how come.<br>
<br>
<b>Jane:</b> This is professional! Where'd you get it?<br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> Would you believe … MI6_Factory_Rejects.co.uk?<br>
<br>
<i>(Daria & Jane stare at Lynn.)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Lynn:</b> Come on, you HAD to expect it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>(Scene: Mack is in his room, sitting at his computer. Music plays on. He inserts the disc and clicks on the icon for "Bmail3.jpg")</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>(Scene: Outside of the Mackenzie house. Over the music, we hear Mack's laughter.)</i><br>

<b>ENDNOTES</b><br>
<br>
1] Okay, those of you who've read the series before know what these are from. Don't spoil it for the others.<br>
<br>
2] I've had several queries as to whether this is an actual URL. As far as I am aware, it's not. But it should be. In any case, Yui Daoren found the equivalent - http://www.loompanics.com/online-store/scstore/index.html<br>
<br>
3] I took a lot of flack for this comment. Look, talk to my imagination, who made the character who has no respect for new punk unless it's Offspring.<br>
<br>
4] Daria's comment on cheerleading from "The Daria Diaries". I prefer the other one, which I think came from a Peanuts strip. Austin used it in his prose adaptation but I elaborated.<br>
<br>
5] From "Arts 'N Crass" and "Daria Dance Party" respectively.<br>
<br>
6] Lynn's C science average is stated out front in "A Meeting Of The Brains". <br>
<br>
7] One demonstration of one-point perspective got her invited to Brittany's party in "The Invitation". <br>
<br>
8] This comes from "The Daria Database", in the Family Portraits section – Brittany's job description.<br>
<br>
9] Said a la Jane from "Arts 'N Crass".<br>
<br>
10] Austin Loomis' Monty Python quote from his prose adaptation of this fic.<br>
<br>
11] Justice for the big evil jock from "The Misery Chick".<br>
<br>
12] The Montana Cabin Fund, noted in "The Daria Database", suffered a killing blow in "The Things We Do For Dough" when her mother went gung-ho about saving for her college education.<br>

Daria and related characters owned by MTV, a Viacom company [created by Glenn Eichler and Susie Lewis Lynn]. Lynn Cullen was created and is owned by Janet "Canadibrit" Neilson, copyright 1999, 2000.
