ACT 1: ALL THE SMALL THINGS

"It started small.  But that's how everything always starts -- very
small."
	-- Egg Shen, _Big Trouble in Little China_

_Lawndale High cafeteria -- lunchtime_

It was an ordinary day.  The Fashion Club leadership were sitting at 
their usual table.  Sandi was drumming her fingers impatiently on the 
table, her facial expression and general manner practically radioactive 
with piss-offedness.  Tiffany looked as if her mind were somewhere else 
-- actually *somewhere* else, not the nowhere it usually went to.
	Finally, Sandi looked up at Tiffany and slammed her fist on the 
table.  She then took a look at her hand.  "I beroke a nail," she said 
pitifully.  After a pause to regather her focus, she went back to being 
irritated.  "And *where* are Tori and Berooke?  I mean, is there a big 
sale over at Cashman's that I was not made aware of?"
	Tiffany was still distracted for some reason.  "I don't think 
so, Sandi.  I guess you could check if you wanted; you have a cellphone, 
riiiight?"
	"Then where *are* they?  I mean, what could *possibly* be more 
important than a Fashion Club meeting?"
	Now Tiffany sounded a little wistful.  "Boyfriends."
	Sandi had never watched any Japanimation (as she thought of it), 
but she did a magnificent facefault nonetheless.  "BOYFERENDS?"
	Tiffany just waved a hand toward another table, over by the 
windows.  Sandi's gaze drifted to the table.  Tori and Brooke were 
sitting across one table from each other; Joey was sitting next to Tori, 
and Jeffy next to Brooke. They all looked very comfortable.
	Sandi was livid, but managed to keep a lid on her temper so that
only a cold anger showed through.  "I see.  Boyferends.  Don't they 
realize that having a steady boyferend takes away thee best way to 
measure popularity?  I mean, there are *expectations* when you're as 
popular as *I* am -- you can't just settle on one guy.  It wouldn't be 
fair to thee *others* who are waiting for thee chance to date me."
	Tiffany wasn't really listening, but it wasn't in her usual you-
made-me-lose-my-place way; if Sandi'd noticed, she actually seemed a 
little sad.  "I guess so, Sandi..."
	Jamie approached the table and stood by Tiffany; who brightened 
noticeably at his approach.  He stood there for a minute, clearing his 
throat once or twice.  She kept waiting happily.  "Uh...Tiffany?" he 
finally said.
	"Yeaaaah, Jamie?"
	Wide-eyed awe.  "You remember my name!"
	Blush.  "Well...yeaaaah..."
	Jamie seemed awfully nervous.  "Uh...I thought...after that thing 
last week, with the..."  He trailed off.
	Tiffany's blush deepened as she too remembered the love-in.  
"Yeaaaah.  That was...kinda..."
	Sandi frowned.  "Ex*keeyuse* me, Tiffany, but I am ta-*rying* 
to conduct a *meeting* here..."
	Jamie ignored that.  "Uh...I wanted to know...could I...did
you...?"
	Tiffany's breath was sufficiently bated.  "What?"
	"Do you wanna go out with me tonight?" he blurted.
	Instant brightening.  "Suuuuure!"
	"I haven't taken Quinn out in a *long* time so I can afford Chez 
Pierre again..."  He realized what he'd missed.  "You...you mean it?"
	"Well," Sandi snarled, "if you're just going to *ignore* me, 
I think I'll go check my makeup."  She made one last try at getting her 
digs in.  "And Tiffany dear...you might want to avoid that shade of 
balusher in future -- I hate to tell you this but it makes your face 
look a little bit...full."
	Tiffany hadn't even heard Sandi's weight-related barb.  
"Suuuuure," she told Jamie.
	Sandi got up and stalked off, turning around again just in time 
to see Jamie eagerly take the vacated seat across from Tiffany.  She 
scowled at that and moved on to the table occupied by Stacy and some 
of the other cheerleaders -- Angie, Nikki and Brittany, she thought -- 
all chattering animatedly.  "Stacy, can I *talk* to you?"
	Stacy looked up uncertainly.  "Sorry, Sandi, but I really can't.  
Cheerleading stuff, you know..."
	"I just want to ask *one* kuwestion."  Stacy looked at her a 
bit dubiously, but didn't actually say "no," so she pressed on.  "What 
*is* it with thee popular girls and..."  She didn't even try to hide 
her disgust.  "...steady *boyferends* all of a sudden?  I mean, it's 
like *every* popular girl...and even some of thee social *rejects*...
have steady boyferends.  Since when did having one add to your
popularity?"
	"Well, *Kevvie* and I have been going out for--"
	"Brittany," Angie interrupted, "you were going steady with Kevin 
when *normal* people were dating ten guys a week."
	"HEY!" Brittany squeaked indignantly.  "I am *so* normal!"  She 
got up then.  "Where *is* Kevvie, anyway?  He'd better not be with that 
*Trisha* girl..."  She stalked off, fuming gently.
	The cheerleaders shared a look that said without words, _Britt?  
Normal?  Who does she think she's kidding?_  Then Stacy turned back to 
our special guest.  If Sandi hadn't known better, she'd almost have sworn 
Stacy was taking some kind of pleasure in her next comment.  "Actually, 
Sandi...it was *Quinn* who made exclusive dating the popular thing to 
do."  She gestured to a table where Quinn was sitting with Ted, the two 
of them happily chatting away and holding hands across the table.  "Since 
she started going out with Ted, just about *everyone* started getting 
steady boyfriends.  And then when Quinn got in trouble and Lynn and those 
other people started that protest of the three-foot rule, it just seemed 
like--"
	"*Ee-nough* already!" Sandi interjected.  "I mean, how many times 
do I have to hear thee name *Ku-winn?*"
	Stacy sort of hid a smirk.  "Well, she's *still* more popular 
than *you* are, even *without* the Fashion Club."
	Angie spoke up again.  "So are *you,* Stacy -- don't forget."
	A blush and a grin.  "Really?  I mean, I've *never* been more 
popular than *Sandi*..."
	Sandi scowled and backed away a little; they'd forgotten she was 
there, and she decided to take advantage of the chance to eavesdrop.
	"Sure," Nikki chimed in.  "And more than Brittany too.  I mean, 
you're smarter than Brittany and a *whole* lot nicer than Sandi..."
	"Even Lynn *Cullen*'s nicer than *Sandi,* Nikki.  And *she* came 
up with those *cheers.*"  Angie shuddered.
	"Yeah, that Lynn girl's vicious, but she can be nice.  Sandi's 
hit a real low."
	"But Quinn's *still* the most popular kid in school," Stacy had 
to point out.  "Even *more* so now that she's stopped using guys like..." 
She trailed off uncomfortably.
	"Toilet paper," Nikki said gently; "you can say it.  It was 
written on that bathroom wall for a *long* time."  After a moment, she 
suppressed a giggle.  "Now it's written about *Sandi.*"
	That tore it for Sandi; she stalked off to the laughter of the 
others.  _I should have *known* that would come back to bite me in thee 
ass._  She glared at where Quinn and Ted were sharing a kiss.  "Well.  
We'll just see how long *that* lasts."

_The halls of Lawndale High_

At his locker, Tom pulled out a book and looked at it derisively.  Lynn 
approached, followed his gaze for a moment and decided to explain.  "The 
Nose hadn't got the school budget back on track enough to replace all 
the textbooks yet."  _Then again, can you blame him?  After some of the 
shenanigans the Jackboot pulled, I doubt Bill *Gates* could unscrew 
*this* school's budget, let alone that cola company that tried to offer 
Caldwell the sponsorship._
	"So that's why our Geography book still mentions East and West
Berlin."
	Nod.  "At least he shelled out for a new periodic table for the 
science room wall.  The one that was there when I came had the last ten 
or so marked on in *pencil.*"
	Sigh.  "Shame Lehrer isn't going to be principal all that long."  
Lynn raised an eyebrow.  "Word is the Nose is going to be back in time 
for the spring semester."  Tom checked his watch and groaned.  "Speaking 
of Lehrer, I have to talk to him about something.  Tell Narcissa to meet 
me in front of her house at six, would you?"
	That eyebrow again.  "Nudge-nudge-wink-wink-saynomore?"
	Tom managed to blush slightly.  "Ew," he said unconvincingly, 
then shook himself and went on in his normal tones.  "Not like that.  
She wants to learn to fight properly and doesn't want to tip her parents 
off by asking for formal martial arts training.  So I'm giving her a 
few tips."
	"When'd you start *this*?"
	"Three days ago."
	Lynn allowed herself a slight smirk at Rust's expense.  "When 
do you think she'll go beyond your teaching?"
	Tom seemed to visibly deflate.  "I give her two weeks, tops."  
He took a moment to nerve himself, then asked, "...Can I...?"
	Sigh.  "Fine.  Send her my way if you have to.  And I'll pass 
the message along."
	"Great."  Tom tossed the book into his locker and slammed it 
shut; then, as an afterthought, called "Thanks" over his shoulder as 
he made his exit.
	"Yeah, whatever," Lynn muttered to his retreating back.  She 
started off in the opposite direction, rounded a corner...and collided 
with Sandi hard enough to make them both stagger backwards.
	"OW!" Janus snapped.  "Watch where you're *going!*"
	Lynn raised the eyebrow.  "Excuse me?  *You* were the one 
standing right in a major traffic area."
	"Oh, what*ever.*  Popular people can stand wherever they *want* 
to stand.  I mean, those geeky ugly galasses you wear *must* help you 
see better...so you can just watch where you're going and stay *out* 
of my *way.*"  She walked off with Lynn death-glaring after her.  The 
glare would have been more intense if she'd been able to see the way 
Sandi was smirking as she walked.

				      * * *

_Morgendorffer Home Base, that night_

Quinn was sitting impatiently on the front step, wearing the sweatpants-
and-sports-bra ensemble she'd worn training with Scar, with her pink 
leather jacket over it all.  The Rustbucket pulled noisily up to the 
curb, and Quinn got up and walked towards it, scowling.
	"Still with the pink," that Tom freak said.
	Quinn ignored that.  "You're *late.*"
	"Business."
	"Well, could we please hurry 'cause Ted's gonna call at nine-
thirty to find out how my first day at the animal shelter went."
	A raised eyebrow.  "Animal shelter?"
	"Oh, and I'm supposed to tell him I'm going to be rolling around 
on mats with *you* all night?  Are you *kidding*?  No *wonder* you and 
Jane broke up!"
	That obviously stung.  "Get in."  Quinn got in the car and it 
drove off.
	Down Glen Oaks Lane a ways, from where they'd seen the whole 
thing, Ted looked extremely sad, and Sandi was trying, with no success 
at all, to hide a smirk.  "I'm *really* sorry you had to find out this 
way, Ted.  But I just couldn't let a gareat guy like you go on not 
knowing that his girlferend was...well, cheating on him that way."
	"But...but...why didn't she *tell* me?"
	"Well, you *must* know what people say about Ku-winn...what her 
*reputation* is..."
	"I never gave any credence to the rumours.  I just thought that 
it must be jealous people wanting to hurt her.  But..."
	"Of course, you *couldn't* have believed that Ku-winn would do 
something like this to you.  You're too *nice* to think that someone 
else would do something that..."  She was now oozing enough false concern 
to float a battleship.  "Come on, Ted. Let's go out somewhere and maybe 
*I* can help you take your mind off this whole unpaleasant incident."  
With a very wounded look on his face, Ted let a vindicated-looking Sandi
lead him away.  He threw a single glance back at the Morgendorffer house 
before turning his attention to where he was going -- away from it.


ACT 2: TERRIBLE LIE

"It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
 And are you thinking of me when you f*** her?"

_Morgendorffer Home Base, kitchen -- the next morning_

Daria was sitting at the table, eating a muffin and reading the paper, 
when Quinn came in, moving a little stiffly.  Daria looked up and raised 
an eyebrow.  "How does the other guy look?" she asked, half-amused and 
almost sounding it.
	Quinn smirked.  "AWFUL.  I mean, he can *kinda* fight -- I mean 
with moves and technol...tech...you know, he knows how *properly* -- 
but he can't see what someone else is going to do and fix what *he's* 
doing so he doesn't get beat on."  She rotated her left shoulder with 
a groan.  "But when he *did* get a hit, he got it *hard.*"  And the smirk 
came back.  "*I* learned to do that pretty *well!*  I mean, I *knew* 
I could *do* it and--"  There was a sound of horns and motors from the 
outside.
	Daria dropped her muffin and got up.  "That's my ride."
	"Who's driving you?"
	"Jane."  Daria thought about that question a moment and began 
to get suspicious.  "Why?"
	"Well, I'm still *really* sore from all of yesterday and even 
if I *could* tell Ted where I *was* last night, he can't drive and his 
parents won't even let him have a *bike* and I don't want to call that 
*Tom* guy 'cause I bet he wouldn't give me a ride anyway no matter *how* 
sore I am just because I kicked his butt and--"
	Somehow, Daria finally managed to get a word in wedgewise.  
"*Look,* Quinn.  I'll ask Jane if she minds driving you -- on two 
conditions."
	"*Anything,*" Quinn pled, "I absolutely *promise!*"
	"First, five bucks to Jane for gas and ten to me as a finder's
fee."  Quinn dug in her pocket and handed over the cash.  "Second...you 
don't say another word until we get to school."
	"But...but...but..."
	"That's three. You walk."  Daria turned and headed for the door.
	"WAIT!"  Daria turned back.  Quinn made a zipper motion across 
her lips.
	Daria half-smirked.  "That's better.  Come on."  She turned one 
last time and exited.  Quinn, a little put out, grabbed the remaining 
two bites of Daria's muffin, looked at it speculatively -- and hungrily 
-- for a moment, then with an inner _Ew, what am I *thinking?*_, dropped 
the muffin remnant and headed out.

				      * * *

_Lawndale High_

Daria and Jane walked through the halls, Quinn trailing behind them.  
As they passed the other lockers, people seemed to be looking askance 
at Quinn, sometimes reforming the gossip huddle when she'd passed by.  
Quinn was looking just that little bit paranoid.
	Jane only peripherally noticed, being distracted by something 
more immediate.  "Wow.  All the way to school and not a *word* out of 
Princess Grace.  That's *got* to be some kind of record."
	"Well, given the workout she got last night," Daria pointed out, 
"walking would *not* have agreed with her."  There were snickers and 
disapproving noises from the people who'd caught that.
	Quinn sped up so that Daria and Jane were flanking her.  "Uh...
guys?"
	Jane sighed.  "Such bliss just couldn't last."
	"I'm *serious.*  People are *looking* at me funny!  I mean, is 
it *that* much like social death to be *seen* with you people?  Oh my 
*God,* what's going to happen to my *reputation?*"
	"Like *you* ever cared, *Quinn.*"  The three of them turned 
toward the sound, their attention caught the slightly nasty tone in 
Angie's voice.  She was standing with a small group of her fellow 
cheerleaders, Brittany, Nikki and Stacy among them.
	Stacy turned on her colleague.  "Come *on,* Angie!  Back off!  
We don't know the whole story!"
	"Yeah, but we know what she *is.*  I dated Skylar for awhile 
and he told me about that *thing* she pulled because of the ski house 
and the rest of it.  She'd *definitely* go for him..."
	"It might be a mistake!"
	A few more kids gathered around Stacy and Quinn.  Daria and Jane 
were joined by Lynn and A.P., who surveyed the scene and exchanged a 
look.  "Ooh," the Maverick piped up.  "Popularity Deathmatch?"
	"What have I told you about watching MTV?" Lynn chid.
	A.P. went all shamefaced.  "Sorry."
	Quinn approached Stacy, heedless of the spectators.  "*What* 
might be a mistake?  Stacy, what's going *on?*"
	Stacy was all breathless worry, very much the Shrinking Violet 
of old.  "It's all over school, Quinn.  Sandi and Ted saw you getting 
into that Tom guy's car last night when you told Ted that you were 
volunteering at the animal shelter."
	"no..."
	"And Sandi got into your locker, I think, because there's a piece 
of paper on the bulletin board showing every excuse you ever used on 
a guy to break a date."
	Quinn went very pale.  "Stacy, I was *different* then..."
	Stacy waved that away.  "That's the least of your problems, 
Quinn.  *I* know you're different now, but the rest of the school doesn't 
see it that way.  And neither does Ted."
	"Wh..."  Gulp.  "How bad is it?"
	"Brooke said she heard him say that he was going to break up 
with you.  And...oh, Quinn, he's probably going to go out with Sandi."
	"WHAT?"
	"Jack and Cindy saw them together at Pizza King last night.  
She was...`comforting'...him."
	Quinn was beyond numb, into just blankly processing the info 
and its implications.  "She did it on purpose.  She knew somehow and 
she set me up."
	"She *was* acting pretty jealous of you yesterday," Stacy rather 
reluctantly allowed as.  "But because of everything with Skylar and Joey, 
Jeffy and whatshisname and Corey and Robert and everybody *else*..."
	"She set me up."  Some emotion was starting to show through -- 
specifically, blind rage.  "That little tramp set me up, ruined my 
reputation and stole my first real *boyfriend!*"
	Stacy was frightened -- she'd never seen Quinn like this before.  
"Uh...Quinn? I know you're upset, but..."  She faded out as Quinn stalked 
off through the murmuring crowd.  Stacy looked *really* scared now.  
"Quinn, *wait!*"  Daria, Jane, Lynn and A.P. exchanged a look and moved 
to follow her.

				      * * *

Elsewhere in the halls, Sandi was at her locker, fixing her mascara, 
smirking to herself.  Quinn came around the corner and stopped dead at 
the sight of Sandi.  For a moment, the two of them just faced off -- 
anyone who'd seen Quinn training with Scar would have been running like 
hell.  Sandi, however, just smirked and gave Quinn a mocking little wave 
before shutting her locker and moving away.
	Quinn was paralyzed by rage for a moment...then started forward 
after Sandi.  Daria and Jane came around the corner behind her and put 
the grab on her before she could get two steps.  At this, Quinn just 
*erupted* -- there's no other word for it -- struggling wildly in their 
grips.  "LET *GO* OF ME, DARIA!  I'M GOING TO BEAT HER FACE INTO NEXT 
*YEAR*!"
	Daria held on for dear life, amazed at the effort it was taking.  
"Quinn, calm *down.*  Beating up on Sandi in school hours isn't going 
to solve anything..."
	"It'll feel *damn* good now let the hell *go* of me!"
	Lynn moved in to face her anti-sister.  "You want to do this?  
I understand.  But you'll have to get past all *four* of us to do it."
	"*Fine,* go *right* ahead and get in my way!  I can kick *all* 
of your butts and you *know* it!"
	"Debatable."  Lynn let that hang a moment, then added, "But can 
you kick the butt of a gun?"  Quinn finally stopped struggling at that 
point -- she went very still and wide-eyed, in fact.  Lynn unzipped her 
jacket ever-so-slightly, just enough to reveal the butt of her .45, and 
nodded once, a look in her eyes that said _Dare me._
	Quinn let herself go limp in a show of surrender, and Lynn zipped 
her jacket back up.  At that point, Daria and Jane felt comfortable with 
letting go, but they stayed ready to grab her if she showed any more 
signs of going Chernobyl.
	Quinn's anger had apparently faded, though; now, without it to 
prop her up, she was just plain miserable.  "I can't face this.  I can't 
explain to Ted what I did and I can't face what they're all saying about 
me.  I wanna go home."  For a wonder, she thought about that.  "But I 
*can't* go home because if I *do* go home, they'll all think I'm scared 
and ashamed and that everything they said about me was *right.*"  Sigh.  
"If I can't pound Sandi's lying little face into pulp, then what *can* 
I do?"  So asking, she made her departure, with surprising grace under 
the circumstances.
	Silence supervened for a moment as all parties considered her 
last statement.  And then, as if telepathically linked, Daria, Jane and 
A.P. turned to look at Lynn, who asked, "What?"
	"Like you don't know," Daria scoffed.  "What's it going to cost 
me to unleash the full force of vengeance that is the Purple Peril on 
Sandi Griffin?"
	"You're offering *me* money.  Your demi-sister the trust fund 
brat.  Daria, if you really want me to make Janus pay for *this* little 
stunt, it'll be a freebie."  She thought about it.  "On the other hand, 
that doesn't stop me from seeing what I can get out of your *other* half-
sib..."
	A slight smirk.  "That's the Cullen we know and look askance 
at."
	"Want in on this, A.P.?"
	"With you all the way as always, Purple Peril!"  He took a moment 
for thought.  "Method 14?"
	"I don't think so.  No one eats the salad in the cafeteria.  
Anyway, I have yet to see poison ivy, poison oak *or* stinging nettles 
in Lawndale.  If I'd known I was going back into the revenge business, 
I would have set the greenhouse up again when we moved."
	The bell rang, mercifully saving Daria and Jane from having to 
think too hard about that one.  "We talk about it over lunch," Erudite 
Emerald decreed, a proposition that met with somber nods all around.

				      * * *

_Pizza King_

Quinn was sitting alone in a booth, picking at a pizza, with an odd 
expression -- a combination of sullenness, heartbreak, helplessness and 
utter rage.  The door opened, and Lynn came in with a book under her 
arm.  She scanned the place, saw her opposite number, and stepped over 
to the booth.  "This isn't your usual table."
	"Yeah, well, I don't see *your* name written on it," Quinn
snarked.
	Lynn looked at Quinn impassively for a moment, then took a seat 
across from the other without being asked.  "Congratulations on your 
self-restraint, by the way.  Admirable, the way you didn't go after Sandi 
straight after school."
	"Yeah, well, knowing you, you'd have come after me with that 
gun."  Then she had another thought; it was getting to be a habit.  "Wait 
-- how do you know I *didn't*?"  Lynn just looked at her.  "You kept 
*tabs* on me?"
	"Precautionary measures.  No one, least of all you, can afford 
to have you sent to juvenile hall."
	"Huh.  But the people who live near you think it's a *crackhouse* 
or something and *you* never get busted!"  Lynn continued to look at 
her steadily.  "How do you *cope* with this?  You've been dealing with 
this stupid cr..."  She caught herself -- this was a bit public to be 
mentioning the Smythe Family interests.  "...thing longer than *any* 
of us.  Do you have, like, some kind of motto like Mr. O'Neill sometimes 
says works?  I mean, it sounds geeky, but you *are* a geek and I'm 
*desperate* so--"
	"My motto?" Lynn interjected.  "`Life's an eternal ball-breaking 
bitch.  Why not imitate it?'"
	Quinn was now sobbing with pure rage.  "It's not *fair!*  It's 
just...not...*fair!*  I can't have a boyfriend unless he's one of your 
*Family* people and I *couldn't* get Ted involved after what happened 
to Jodie and Mack and I can't even have *revenge* because I'd get into 
*worse* trouble and anyway, I've *seen* what happens!"
	"Excuse me?"
	"That Falcon jerk -- sorry, your *dad* -- didn't want to do 
something that that Merritt jerk wanted him to do so for revenge he hit 
*you.*  Then your dad did something *else* that probably made that 
Merritt jerk even *more* mad and then he wanted to do bad things to *us!* 
And *then* we had to do bad things to him *back* and now he and that 
Jensen jerk are *dead* but those freaks in San Francisco say it's *still* 
not over because they're always going to want to get us!  It's just like 
with *Sandi!*  If I hit her she'll get her mother to do something to 
me or do something *herself* and then I'll have to do it back and it'll 
be one of those vicious...*things!*  And it's JUST...NOT...*FAIR*!"  
The rest was silence, except for vicious sobbing.
	Lynn was a little bit stunned.  _How did she say all that without 
pausing for breath even *once*?_  Then she raised an eyebrow in what 
was, for her, a fairly overt show of sympathy. She handed over the book 
under her arm.  Quinn stopped sobbing and looked at it.  "What the cross-
country experience taught *me* was, if you want revenge, finish the job 
completely the first time."  As Quinn looked at the cover of the book 
-- A.P.'s magnum opus -- her face slowly brightened to an evil smirk.


ACT 3: ORIGINAL PRANKSTER

"You and me, I can see us dyin', oh please
 Don't speak, I know just what you're sayin'
 So please stop explainin', don't tell me 'cause it hurts"
	-- No Doubt, "Don't Speak"

_The preparations_

Daria, Jane, Lynn and A.P. had gathered at his locker.  Quinn approached 
them and handed Lynn her book back before quickly walking away.  The 
Peril opened _Twenty-Five Sure-Fire Ways to Drive Any Teacher into Early 
Retirement_ -- several bills had been used as a bookmark at "Method 17."  
Lynn and A.P. looked impressed; Daria and Jane, after scanning the rest 
of the page, looked at the terrors of Oakwood with a sort of sick, 
helpless awe.  Jane started laughing then, while Daria just shook her 
head in disbelief.
	Up in her Chamber of Dark Mysteriousness, Lynn was busy on the 
computer; A.P. sat on the desk beside her, watching.  The screen was 
showing the homepage of "Bob's Bargain Basement Bomb and Biohazard."  
Lynn clicked on "Chemical Warfare Warehouse" and smirked. A.P. grinned 
back.  Daria walked in with cans of pop, looked over Lynn's shoulder 
and gave her sister a look that would have translated into words as "You 
enjoy this *entirely* too much."
	In the library, Lynn was talking to Stacy.  The Violet looked 
apprehensive, but determined and maybe just a little mischievous.  Money 
changed hands.
	The door of McIntyre Manor opened, and Carol stood there.  She 
blinked hazily at the delivery person -- a short, pale girl with fluffy 
hair dyed pink; she looked a bit as if a stick of cotton candy had fallen 
on her head -- then there was thumping on the stairs and A.P. appeared 
at his mother's side, grabbing the parcel from Cotton Candy Girl.  He 
nods thanks, wearing a total mad-scientist grin, and barged out of sight. 
Carol, looking a bit more out of it than usual, signed the proof-of 
receipt, then held out a hand for the parcel.  Cotton Candy Girl looked 
wide-eyed at Carol for a moment, then handed her a pack of chewing gum.  
Carol nodded her thanks and shut the door.  Cotton Candy Girl walked 
away, shaking her head and looking fed up.  _Why do *I* get all the 
weirdoes?_
	In the stadium bleachers, Stacy, carrying her pom-poms, was 
talking to Tiffany, who was presumably there to watch Jamie play.  Though 
Stacy didn't know it, Tiffany had had that same little sly smile when 
she told Daria which was Sandi's locker.  More money changed hands.
	In A.P.'s room, hereinafter the Techno-Weasel Den, he and Jane 
were working on some pinkish goo bubbling in a crucible over a bunsen 
burner.  A succession of dyestuffs were sitting on the counter beside 
them.  A.P. shows the mixture to Jane, who frowned and added just a touch 
of red dye.  The mixture darkened almost imperceptibly.  A.P. grinned 
more evilly than one might expect, then gave a Frankensteinesque cackle.  
Jane matched it with her most evil smirk.
	In science class, seemingly unnoticed by Barch, Stacy handed 
Tiffany a tube of lipstick.  Quinn watched with a smirk.  Ted, emboldened 
by Barch's apparent lack of attention, turned a bit to scowl at Quinn, 
and her face fell.  Barch then turned on him, furious.

				      * * *

_Tragic Flaw_

Sandi was doing her makeup at the girls' bathroom mirror.  Some of the 
contents of her makeup bag included mascara, concealer and -- most 
important -- a tube of lipstick.  Tiffany waited until Sandi was 
engrossed in her grooming rituals, then took out a lipstick seemingly 
identical to Sandi's -- the one Stacy had given her -- and swapped it 
for the original.  She then headed for the door, opening it a crack to 
reveal Quinn, Jane, Lynn, A.P. and a reluctant-looking Daria.  Tiffany 
gave them all that little smirk.
	"Countdown in five," Jane announced, "four, three, two, one..."
	"Mmm-*mmph?!?*" in familiar low-alto tones.
	The quintet (puncrime, I know) dashed around a corner -- A.P. 
grinning, Jane and Lynn smirking fit to bust, Daria smirking a little 
in spite of herself, Quinn giggling.  A moment later, Sandi dashed around 
the same corner, eyes wide and panicked, hand clamped over her mouth.
	She collided with Acting Principal Hopper (the only name she 
knew him by) as he exited an office.  "Good morning, Miss Griffin," he 
said.  "And what's yer hurry?"
	Sandi removed the hand from her lips.  "Mmph-mmmff!" she said.  
"Mmm-mmph-*mmm!*"
	"Yeh'll have teh talk up a bit.  They accuse *my* countrymen 
of mumblin', but yeh're in the indeciph'rable range."
	Sandi pointed to her lips.  "MMMMMMPH!" she explained.
	Lehrer allowed himself a small smirk.  "Miss Griffin, yer not 
makin' a jot o' sense.  Now get yerself ter class before yeh're in my 
bad graces for tardiness.  Or mebbe loiterin'.  Or inappropriate 
behaviour on school grounds."  He walked away; the way his smirk widened 
when he knew Sandi could no longer see his face indicated, just in case 
you hadn't guessed, that he knew *exactly* what'd happened to her.
	Sandi stood there for a moment, unable to believe what had just 
happened.  Her fists clenched hard enough that a small trickle of blood 
began seep through her fingers; she was visibly *vibrating* with rage, 
basically going through a near-blowup that even DeMartino couldn't have 
copied no matter how hard he tried.  Then she stalked off down the
corridor.

				      * * *

In another part of the hall, Quinn was applying her own lipstick, looking 
casual and relatively cheerful.  Sandi stalked up to her, and Quinn 
looked up with a smile.  "Oh, *hi,* Sandi!" she said, just like the old 
days.
	"Mmmmmmmmmph?" Sandi accused.
	"Oh, you're looking for *this.*"  Quinn held up a plastic bottle 
of clear solution.  (Daria, Jane, Lynn and A.P. peered around a corner, 
watching the scene play out.)  "It's a solvent -- it'll loosen the glue 
on your lips but won't kill you or turn your lips green."
	"Actually," A.P. confessed under his breath) "I dunno about the 
green lips part..."  That got him Looks from the female contingent.  
"I didn't have a lot of time!  And if it *does,* won't it be funny?"
	All three considered that a moment, then shrugged acceptance 
and resumed watching the drama unfold.
	"MMMPH."
	"You know something?" Quinn observed serenely.  "I think most 
of the kids at school -- maybe even some of the *teachers* -- will 
*thank* me for the service I'm doing by not giving this stuff to you."  
She put it down on her locker shelf and shuts the door.  "By making you 
shut *up* for a little while, my popularity will *skyrocket.*"
	That was it.  Sandi went into intercontinental ballistic bitch 
mode.  "MMMMMMMMPH!" she attempted to snarl as she threw herself at 
Quinn.  Quinn allowed herself to be caught by surprise, and Sandi got 
a good punch to Quinn's left eye.  Then, when Sandi threw a second punch, 
Quinn caught in, grabbed her in a wrist-lock, slammed her into the 
lockers good and hard a couple of times, then released Sandi *just* long 
enough to kick her a good one to the side of the head.  Sandi dropped 
like a rock.
	Lehrer, by this time, had joined Daria, Jane, Lynn and A.P. and 
was looking at Quinn's handiwork almost approvingly.  Now for a good 
job of acting.  Quinn was the picture of innocence, sorrowful and pained 
-- suspiciously so, Sandi might have thought.  "Mr. Hopper?  Sorry about 
all this but she *attacked* me!  Ohhhhhh I think she gave me a black 
eye..."  At least she didn't have to fake the pain.
	"Not another word, Miss Morgendorffer.  I saw th' whole thing.  
Yeh were well within yer rights."  He paused for effect.  "Miss 
*Griffin,* however..."  Sandi let out a muffled groan.

				      * * *

_Morgendorffer Home Base_

Quinn looked at herself in the bathroom mirror.  Sure enough, she had 
a real nasty shiner there.  She frowned at it for a moment, then shrugged 
and left the room.  There was music coming down the upstairs hall from 
the speakers in Daria's room; -- it was pretty soft, but it was something 
by that *grunge* band, the Men in the Box or whatever.  Daria's door 
was standing open a crack.  Quinn approached the door, stopping as she 
heard Jane's voice.  "So you're telling me Lehrer had the power to get 
Sandi *suspended*?"
	Quinn's eyes widened in a kind of triumph, and she peered into 
the room.  Daria was on the bed, staring at the ceiling.  Lynn was on 
the rug, also staring at the ceiling.  Jane was sitting in Daria's desk 
chair.  A.P. was sitting cross-legged on the floor, tinkering idly with 
Daria's chemistry set.
	"Well," Lynn pointed out, "for stuff like assault, it's kind 
of built in.  Three to five days is the norm."
	"Believe me," A.P. added fervently, "she knows."  That netted 
him Looks from Daria and Jane.  "Well, she *does!*"  And a Glare from 
Lynn, which made him go *gleep*.  "Shuttingupnow."
	"It doesn't matter anyway.  Sandi got so embarrassed by the whole 
thing that she's refusing to go back to Lawndale High -- *ever.*  We 
got some third party legit mentioning that a Mr. and Mrs. Griffin were 
looking for good schools and job prospects in and around Texas."
	There was silence.  Lynn's smirk was unsettling *all* of them
...except A.P., who seems to know.
	Finally, Quinn couldn't take it anymore.  "SO WHAT DID YOU *DO*, 
ALREADY?!?" she demanded as she barged into the room.
	No one looked the least bit surprised at the sudden in-burst...
or the accompanying outburst.  "Hey, Quinn," Daria greeted her mother's 
other daughter.
	"Hey-ho, Narcissa!"
	You could have knocked Quinn over with a mascara brush.  "You
...you knew I was out there the whole *time*?"
	"We've been hanging around *her* too long."  Jane jerked a thumb 
at Lynn.
	Lynn, still sprawled on her back on the rug, gave an idle wave.  
"In answer to your question..."  She gave a small smirk now.  "The first 
rule about Project Mayhem is..."
	Quinn raised an eyebrow.  "Before I have to break your arm...
*Peril.*"
	Lynn raised an eyebrow of her own right back at that.  "Look, 
you obviously haven't seen the movie--"
	"Of *course* I did! Brad Pitt is *so* cute, even *with* that 
God-awful haircut..."
	Sigh.  "...Or you were so busy drooling over Brad Pitt that you 
don't remember what Project Mayhem *was.*  Arson.  Mischief."  A pause, 
then a small smirk.  "And Disinformation.  We pulled the latter on the 
Griffin family and pointed them to...a place that probably wasn't what
she had in mind."
	Glee fit.  "Oooooooooh!  Where?  Wherewherewhere?"
	"I think I'd like to know that too," Daria agreed.
	"Yeah," Jane added; "if my conscience isn't going to let me sleep 
at night, I'd like it to have a more specific target on this one."
	"Think we'll wait awhile on that one, guys," A.P. said.  "After 
all, we wouldn't want you feeling sorry for her *too* soon."
	"I'm not *going* to feel sorry for her," Quinn stated simply.
	"But we'll wait until it's final anyway," Lynn replied.  
"Wouldn't want you to get your hopes up."
	Her most long-suffering sigh.  "Fine."  A pause.  "Lynn...I 
wanted to ask you something.  Who came up with that...that *Method,* 
anyway?"
	A.P. jerked a thumb at Lynn.  "Hers.  Well, *I* thought it'd 
be funny to glue someone's mouth shut.  Purple Peril here had the idea 
for putting it in the lipstick after the rubber cement chewing gum didn't 
work."
	"I *thought* so."  Another pause.  "You know, Lynn, you know 
a *lot* about makeup and flirting and stuff like that.  I bet you could 
be really *really* popular if you put your mind to it!"  She met Daria 
and Jane's incredulous stares; then A.P.'s Lord-have-mercy-on-her-soul 
expression; then Lynn's glare.  At the last, she went *chalk white*.  
"Or at least you can tell me how I can cover up this black eye," she 
hurriedly added.
	"No makeup invented can cover up a black eye, Quinn."  That got 
Lynn matched Looks from Daria and Jane.  "Just don't ask."

				      * * *

_Lawndale High, the next day_

Quinn was stowing books, looking a bit forlorn.  A very nervous-looking 
Ted approached, wringing his hands.  He stopped about ten feet away from 
Quinn and just watched her for a moment. Then he dared to speak.  "Uh
...Quinn?"
	Quinn stiffened but didn't turn around.  "Hi Ted."
	"Quinn...I talked to Stacy."
	"That's nice."
	"She..."  Sigh.  "She said that Sandi was really jealous and 
everything she said about any romance with you and Tom Sloane was total 
fabrication.  And that she was using me to get back at you in some way."  
Silence, in which Quinn didn't turn around.  "Quinn, I was wrong not 
to try to get your side.  I was just afraid.  You're so experienced at 
this sort of thing...dating, I mean...that I thought I...just might not 
be enough for you."  More silence.  "Quinn, please.  If you want to 
explain, I'm ready to listen to your side."
	Quinn still wasn't turning around.  "Ted, it's been nearly two 
*weeks* since Sandi told you all those things and made you spy on me.
If you *really* believed that I could do anything like that to you and 
didn't even wait to hear my side before dumping me, I don't *want* you."
	"Quinn--"
	"Go away, Ted."
	Ted watched her for a moment.  She still didn't turn around.  
After a moment, his shoulders slumped and he walked away.
	A moment later, Quinn shut her locker door and turned.  Now that 
he was gone, and nobody else was around, she could show the world the 
tears that she'd been silently crying the whole time.

				      * * *

_Morgendorffer Home Base -- Quinn's room_

Quinn was face-first on her bed, crying silently again -- only now it 
was into that damn smiley-face pillow.  There was a knock on the door.  
"Go away or I shall taunt you a second time."  A moment later, the reflex 
words registered with her brain, and the waterworks instantly turned 
off as her eyes widened.  "Omigod, did I *say* that?"
	"I was about to ask that," Daria admitted as she opened the 
door.  "Can I come in?"
	"I guess."
	Daria entered, bearing an envelope, and sat down on Quinn's bed.  
A moment of silence ensued.  "I heard about what you said to Ted."  A 
moment's silence more.  "You lied to him again, didn't you?"
	"It was in a good cause.  That A.P. guy got hurt 'cause Lynn's 
in it.  And watch Mack get hurt more...you know, like smacked or shot 
or knifed hurt...'cause Jodie's in it.  I can't watch Ted get hurt 'cause
..."  A heavy sigh.  "...'cause *I'm* in it."
	More silence.
	"Would it help or hurt if I said I was proud of you?"
	"I don't know."
	"Well, I am."  She let that hang a moment.  "And I have something 
here that might cheer you up."  She handed Quinn the envelope.  "If you 
need someone...check Pizza King.  We're usually there."  She made her 
exit.
	Quinn looked after Daria for a moment, then smiled a little and
looked at the envelope.  She pulled out a photograph -- and looked at it
for a moment in total disbelief.  Then she burst out laughing, fit
to bust, smothering the guffaws in the smiley-face pillow the same way 
she'd just been stifling her sobs.
	The picture fluttered to the floor -- it was a very familiar 
scene.  Okay, not *completely* familiar, but Quinn had gone to Highland 
High too.  Sandi was seated in the back row, between those two...freaks 
of nature that used to hang around Daria, the ones Quinn had been lucky 
enough not to meet until the day of the move.  They were leering at 
Sandi, who looked depressed as anything.  _That'd brighten *any* day._

				      * * *

_Highland High_

	"Hey...hey Butt-Head! Mheheheheheheh! She's got thingies!"
	"Shut up, Beavis! I'm gonna score! -- Hey baby.  Wanna...do it?
Uhhuhuhuhuhuhhuh!"
	"No way, assmunch! She wants *me!*"
	Sandi let out a groan of despair as the two products of severe
inbreeding and irradiated tapwater squabbled as only they can.

ADAPTOR'S NOTES
	Believe it or not, until I went and looked, I'd thought that
the "toilet paper" line was from "My Quinn's Delayed Reaction," because
it's quoted in the synopsis.  I almost corrected CB on that *before*
I went and looked.
	I leave it to you to decide whether you think "that cola company"
is a reference to "Fizz Ed" or "Choice of a Skewed Generation."
	Jan'll probably harm me for mentioning this, but Lynn speaks
from her experience about the black eye thing.  It wasn't like *that,*
mind; it involved a playground swing, as I recall.
	Brief nod to "Goodbye, Diarrhea" there, yes.  C.E. writes a good
stick, and I happen to think that was one of his best.  (It was certainly
the first of his that I read.)
	This adaptation is dedicated to the memory of Douglas Noel Adams,
1952-2001.  Not because it has anything in particular to do with his
style (at least not deliberately), but because without him, you might
not be reading any of these adaptations owing to my having lacked the
extra spark of hope and humor, during my high school years, that kept
my teenage angst from going that last step into oblivion.  So long, Bop
Ad, and thanks for *all* the fish.
