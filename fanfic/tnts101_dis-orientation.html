<p>Opening Sequence:</center>

<p>Splendora's <i>You're Standing On My Neck</i> has been replaced by
<i>Man
on the Moon</i> by REM, and the following montage plays:
<p>A new male teacher looks resigned.&nbsp; Pan over to his students, who
include Daria, Jane, Kevin, Brittany, Upchuck, and most of the rest of
the gang in Daria's class.
<p>The teacher is in Principal Li's office, with narrowed eyes, and regards
Li, who is yakking in grandiose terms, with a look of tired incredulity.
<p>Pizza King.&nbsp; The teacher is grading papers while hoisting a slice
with pepperoni, bacon, onions, anchovies, and sun dried tomatoes.&nbsp;
Pan to Daria, Jane, and Tom's booth.&nbsp; Daria is suspicious, Jane is
startled, and Tom's face is neutral.
<p>A dance.&nbsp; The teacher approaches Claire DeFoe and says something.&nbsp;
She blushes and takes his hand.&nbsp; Pan to Upchuck with a camera snapping
a picture.
<p>The classroom again.&nbsp; The teacher pulls a sleeping Kevin's face
up by his hair, removes some googly-eyed groucho glasses from his face,
folds them, then drops Kevin's face back on his desk.&nbsp; Pan to Daria,
Jane, and Jodie's approving glances.
<p>The Zen.&nbsp; Mystik Spiral is thrashing on stage, and Trent is singing
like his life depends on it.&nbsp; Pan to the audience where one of the
patrons is the teacher, who's looking rather unimpressed.
<p>Daria is at a street corner with Tom, who is speaking.&nbsp; He stops
talking, his tongue cleaving to the roof of his mouth.&nbsp; At the exact
same instant, she acquires a cold, angry look, says something between clinched
teeth, and stalks out of the shot.
<p>The Zen.&nbsp; The teacher is up on stage and apparently doing a monologue.&nbsp;
Pan to the audience, which includes Daria, Jane, and Mystik Spiral.&nbsp;
Everybody is laughing except Daria.
<p>Closeup of Daria Smirking, which acquires an oval around it.&nbsp; Zoom
into the Daria Logo.&nbsp; Super: Daria in:

<p>The New Teacher Series, Episode 1:01
<p>A Piece of Daria Fan Fiction By Ben Breeck</center>

<p>Scene:&nbsp; Lawndale High School.&nbsp; A young man, too old to be
a student, but seemingly not old enough to be a teacher, is walking around
the hall aimlessly, as if not knowing where to go.&nbsp; He is tall (6'
4") and thin, with short cut blond hair with a mustache to match.&nbsp;
He wears a button down shirt vertically stripped blue and white, navy blue
pants and a black leather belt, and medium sized wire frame glasses.<a href="#1">1</a>&nbsp;
Pan to Anthony DeMartino who sees him, and gets angry.&nbsp; Pan through
DeMartino as he walks up to the Young Man.
<p>DeMartino:&nbsp; Hey YOU,&nbsp; WHAT are YOU doing IN the HALL?!?&nbsp;
The BELL for HOMEROOM hasn't SOUNDED YET!! Go TO the GYM!
<p>Young Man:&nbsp; Y-You must be Anthony DiMartino.&nbsp; Hi. My name
is Benjamin Breeck.&nbsp; I'm the new history teacher.&nbsp; (Fumbling
with his pockets) See, this is me. (Pulls out his wallet)
<p>DeMartino: (Looking in the wallet at the driver's license.&nbsp; Both
eyes bulge)&nbsp; That BITCH!&nbsp; I had TENURE!&nbsp; I'll KILL her.&nbsp;
I'll KILL the SUPERINTENDENT and the WHOLE GODDAMN BOARD!!
<p>Ben: (Taken Quickly Aback) Calm down before you burst an aneurysm, Jesus,
Mary, and Joseph.&nbsp; I'm supposed to replace a Mr. Paul Makuchek, who
quit last spring.&nbsp; Could you direct me to Principal Li's Office?
<p>DeMartino: (Visibly Relieved) Oh, SORRY.&nbsp; False ALARM.&nbsp; LISTEN.&nbsp;
GO to the NEXT fork, and HANG a RIGHT.&nbsp; The OFFICE of HELL is on the
LEFT, just OPPOSITE the PENCIL vending MACHINE.
<p>Ben:&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. DeMartino.&nbsp; And call me Ben, if you will.
<p>DeMartino: SURE, and call ME Tony.
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: Principal Li's Office.&nbsp; Angela Li is working at a computer
as her buddha statue sits facing the door on her desk.&nbsp; The sound
of a door opening and shutting.&nbsp; Li Smiles and wheels to face the
camera.
<p>Li:&nbsp; Good Morning.&nbsp; You must be Mr. Breeck.&nbsp; Please sit
down.&nbsp; I'm Angela Li, the principal here at LAWNDALE HIGH.&nbsp; Funny,
the picture made you look so much older and shorter.
<p>Pan to a side shot as Mr. Breeck does so.
<p>Li: I see that you have taken an incomplete tour of our institution.
<p>Ben:&nbsp; Actually, I got lost.
<p>Li: Really now? You are only seven years removed from High School yourself.<a href="#2">2</a>&nbsp;
I thought you could easily negotiate the hallways.
<p>Ben:&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; My high school was much smaller.
<p>Li: (Handing a piece of paper across her desk)&nbsp; Here's a map of
the school.&nbsp; Memorize it.&nbsp; (As Ben takes the map.)&nbsp; Now,
I know the school board and the superintendent liked your credentials,
but I must explain some rules to you.
<p>Ben:&nbsp; And what are they?
<p>Cut to Li
<p>Li: One: Be ever vigilant for drugs, guns, cheating and other deviant
behavior.&nbsp; Our motto is "High security for high performance."&nbsp;
No method or means of searching may be put aside.&nbsp; Two: No fraternizing
with students and no romance between faculty members.&nbsp; It sets a bad
example for LAWNDALE HIGH. (As she continues her speech, we pan to Ben,
whose face takes on a look of tired incredulity. Pan back to Li) Three:
Don't order anything to teach with not on the state list.&nbsp; Our budget
is stretched enough with the standard textbooks.&nbsp; Four: No smoking
except in the teachers' lounge.&nbsp; Five, no unlocking locked or barred
doors except for fire drills and real emergencies.&nbsp; (Blinks) Any questions,
Mr. Breeck?
<p>Ben: No.&nbsp; I don't think so.
<p>Li: (Enthusiastically extending her hand)&nbsp; Welcome to our family
at LAWNDALE HIGH.
<p>Ben: (Reluctantly shaking it) Thanks, I think.&nbsp; (Thought Voice
Over) What the hell have I gotten into?
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>A school bell ringing.&nbsp; Cut to:
<p>Scene: A classroom.&nbsp; Ben is standing in front of the class.&nbsp;
He sighs with a resigned look. Pan over to his students, who include Daria,
Jane, Kevin, Brittany, Upchuck, and most of the rest of the gang in Daria's
class.&nbsp; Quick cut back to Ben.
<p>Ben: (Thought Voice Over) Oh, Dear, looks like nobody really wants to
be here.&nbsp; Why did I get into teaching in the first place? (Out Loud)
Good morning, class, though perhaps not as good as if this place burned
down, wouldn't all of you say?
<p>Sound of a slight snicker from the class.
<p>Ben: (Handing a blank sheet of paper to the student at the front of
the class at the end of the room next to the door) This is an attendance
sheet.&nbsp; If you all could please sign it and pass it around, I can
check it with my attendance book after class.&nbsp; My name is Benjamin
Breeck.&nbsp; B R E E C K.&nbsp; You can call me Mr. Breeck, Benjamin,
Ben,&nbsp; just don't call me Benjy, as it sounds too much like the dog.
<p>Pan to the class, which is all straight faces.&nbsp; Pan back to Ben.
<p>Ben: Ok, that may be a little too old for you all.&nbsp; Now, as your
schedule indicated, you all are indeed in History IV, World Civilization.&nbsp;
I'm planning a rather different section than my fellows for this course.&nbsp;
(Picks up attendance sheet near the window.) Instead of learning all of
what happened, we will instead learn what didn't happen, and therefore
what did through Occam's Razor.&nbsp; (As Brittany raises her hand)&nbsp;
Brittany Taylor, isn't it?&nbsp; What is your question? (Cut to Brittany,
in the second row behind Kevin)
<p>Brittany:&nbsp; I thought that this was History, not Health or Cosmetology.
(Cut to Entire Class)
<p>Class bursts into laughter, except for Daria.&nbsp; Cut to Daria at
her desk.
<p>Daria: (Thought Voice Over) Gee, I wonder how Lawndale High holds these
trophies for most Original Cheer with Little Miss Airhead as head cheerleader?&nbsp;
(Cut back to Ben Speaking to the class)
<p>Ben:&nbsp; Occam's Razor is this: Eliminate the impossibilities, and
whatever is left, however improbable, is the truth.&nbsp; I suppose that
I can skip that the opening chapters of the book of Genesis didn't happen.&nbsp;
I think that Janet Barch or Martin Ogilvie can give a more than satisfactory
explanation in Geology or Paleontology.&nbsp; Lets deal with the Yangshao
culture in China, instead.&nbsp; What didn't happen was a unified state.&nbsp;
The Yangshao was a series of city-states that shared the same written language
and the same cuisine.&nbsp; It was more reminiscent of Classical Greece
or the Classic Period Maya than it was of the later Kingdoms and Empires,
like the Shang and the Chin.&nbsp; Another thing that wasn't were the so-called
"Dragon Bones."&nbsp; They were actually the bones of cattle...
<p>Cut to Daria
<p>Daria: (Thought Voice Over) Hmm... I think I might like this class after
all.
<p>Commercial Break.&nbsp; Stinger: DiMartino yelling at Ben in the middle
of the hall.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: In Front of the Morgendorffer Residence.&nbsp; The sound of a
1978 U.S. Ford Granada <a href="#3.">3</a> driving away.&nbsp; Daria is
adjusting her shirt as she makes her way to the front door of her house.&nbsp;
(This is immediately after the events of the close of "Is it Fall Yet<i>?"
.</i>&nbsp; For the record, nothing happened between Tom and Daria more
than heavy petting.)&nbsp; She opens the door.&nbsp; Cut to tight front
shot of Daria in the doorway, with a shocked look.
<p>Daria: (Gasps)
<p>Jake and Helen: (Off screen, in chorus) DARIA!
<p>Daria slams the door shut.&nbsp; Cut to outside in front of the house.&nbsp;
Daria has her back against the door and her hands are grabbing the edges
of it.
<p>Daria: (Puffs Heavily)
<p>Jake: (offscreen)&nbsp; You can come in now, pumpkin.
<p>Daria: (Sighs in relief and opens the door.)
<p>Quick cut to Jake and Helen on the couch.&nbsp; Jake is rubbing lipstick
off on his arms and adjusting his shirt, while Helen is putting some more
lipstick on and adjusting her dress.
<p>Jake:&nbsp; So, Daria, how was your day?
<p>Daria: Well, aside from my reconciliation with Tom, which I believe
you saw just now, not too much.&nbsp; I got a new history teacher.
<p>Jake:&nbsp; (interested look on his face) Really, now?
<p>Daria: His name is Mr. Breeck and he seems to have a rather unusual
way of teaching.
<p>Helen:&nbsp; (In a vaguely suspicious tone) Not like that show on t.v.,
what was it?&nbsp; "The Magic School Bus?"
<p>Daria: No, not like that.&nbsp; He is trying to teach what happened
by teaching what didn't happen.
<p>Jake: That is odd.&nbsp; Anything else happen today?
<p>Daria:&nbsp; Well, except for Jodie and Mr. O'Niell double teaming me
to
try to join Drama Horizons for an adaptation of Anton Chekhov's <i>The
Cherry Orchard</i>, Upchuck trying out a few new lines on me he learned
over the summer, and some idiot playing around with potassium nitrate and
sulfuric acid in chemistry, not much.&nbsp; It was an average first day
for my Senior year.&nbsp; (To Helen) Were there any new interesting clients,
Mom?
<p>Helen:&nbsp; No, I- Wait a minute?&nbsp; Why are you so interested in
my work, Daria?&nbsp; Daria?
<p>Pan to Daria, as she walks up the stairs.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Cut to:
<p>Scene split screen between Daria's room and Jane's, as they talk on
the phone.
<p>Daria:&nbsp; And when I got in the door, mom and dad were making the
beast with eight limbs and two heads.&nbsp; It shocked me worse than the
yelling they gave me for it.
<p>Jane:&nbsp; I wouldn't be so shocked.&nbsp; I used to walk in on Mom
and Dad in the front hall all the time, back when they stayed in town for
more than ten days at a stretch.&nbsp; So, what do you think of our new
teacher?
<p>Daria:&nbsp; He's all right.&nbsp; (Lips quirk into a Mona Lisa smile
and she changes her voice to imitate his tone)&nbsp; And as you can see,
passing a cord through a hole in a wooden beam does not a pulley make.&nbsp;
In fact it's barely a hoist.
<p>Jane: (Giggles Slightly)&nbsp; Gee, who would have thought that the
pyramids <i>weren't</i> built with the help of large aquaducts that carried
water through mountains and cliffs from Aswan to Giza, to power a hydraulic
ram to lift the giant stones into place?
<p>Daria:&nbsp; (resuming her usual tone) Or that there weren't river locks
of any sort on the Nile, Tigris, Euphrates, or Indus?
<p>Jane:&nbsp; Or that the Pyramids <i>weren't</i> used as beacons for
UFOs?
<p>Daria:&nbsp; To Professor Benjamin Breeck, Master of the Obvious!
<p>Jane:&nbsp; Although I do think that Artie might be a little out of
his depth with him.<a href="#4">4</a>
<p>Daria:&nbsp; That reminds me.&nbsp; How is he going to afford those
texts he put in the syllabus with Angela Li and her budget?
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: Carter County Mobile Home Park&nbsp; Cut to one of the mobile
homes with the lights on.&nbsp; Silhouette of someone stirring something
on a stove .&nbsp; Cut to Interior of the mobile home.&nbsp; Ben is stirring
a wok, and miscellaneous vegetables, meat slices, and grains of rice are
flying around in it.
<p>Ben: (Thought Voice Over) That wasn't too bad.&nbsp; But I think that
Li's fears for her school might become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
<p>Ben stops stirring and removes the wok from the stove, turning it off.&nbsp;
He scoops some of what he has been making onto a paper plate, grabs a spoon,
and walks over to the couch just outside the kitchenette.&nbsp; While lifting
his spoon to his mouth, he clicks the t.v. remote.
<p><i>Sick Sad World</i> Announcer:&nbsp; Could the famous "Crocodile Hunter"
in the land down under be a royal crock?&nbsp; We'll find out when <i>Sick
Sad World</i> returns!<a href="#5.">5</a>
<p>Ben: (Thought Voice Over) It gets better every year.&nbsp; If only its
accuracy was as good as its boldness.
<p>Phone Rings on wooden pallet serving as a T.V. dinner table..&nbsp;
Ben picks it up.
<p>Ben:&nbsp; Hi, mom. (beat) Yes, I'm doing fine. (beat) Not too bad.&nbsp;
The faculty seems right out of a bad sitcom.&nbsp; The principal is a control
freak. (beat) Yes, worse than Herr Speer.<a href="#6">6</a>&nbsp; She even
tried to make me spy on the students during lunch break. (beat)&nbsp; One
of my fellows in the department is rather irritable. (beat) No, he would
make Mr. Westrick look like Mr. Rogers.<a href="#7">7</a>&nbsp; (beat)&nbsp;
Then there's this guy in English.&nbsp; Makes Mr. Rogers look like Saddam
Hussein.&nbsp; I think there's something wrong with him. (beat)&nbsp; I
student taught worse.&nbsp; (Slight smile, beat) I think there may be at
least three people in my classes who want to learn.&nbsp; (beat) Yes, that
<i>is</i>
unbelievable. (Beat) Yes, that cherry cheesecake was wonderful...<a href="#8.">8</a>
<p>Commercial Break. Stinger: just after looking inside the house.
<p>Commercial:
<p><b><tt>Voice Over:&nbsp; On the next episode of The New Teacher Series,
Daria has a few doubts about Lawndale High's newest faculty member.</tt></b>
<p><b><tt>Scene: Pizza King.&nbsp; Daria, Tom, and Jane are at their usual
booth.</tt></b>
<p><b><tt>Daria:&nbsp; There's something vaguely familiar about our new
teacher.</tt></b>
<p><b><tt>Voice Over: And the class gets some new books.</tt></b>
<p><b><tt>Scene: The Classroom.&nbsp; The class is glancing at copies of
some paperbacks on their respective desks.</tt></b>
<p><b><tt>Jodie:&nbsp; What is this book?</tt></b>
<p><b><tt>Voice Over:&nbsp; All this and more, next week!</tt></b>
<p>End Commercial
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene:&nbsp; Classroom, Mr. O'Neil is in front of the classroom, which
is filled with students including Daria, Jane, Kevin, and Brittany.
<p>Mr. O'Neil:&nbsp; So, in Utopia, there really isn't such a thing as
currency, and gold is used mainly for weighing down prisoners and slaves.&nbsp;
(as Daria raises her hand)&nbsp; Yes, Daria?
<p>Pan to Daria
<p>Daria:&nbsp; You might say they're sheckeled to their cells.
<p>Cut back to Mr. O'Neil
<p>Mr. O'Neil:&nbsp; (chuckling a little) That's really funny, Daria.&nbsp;
You might consider doing a humor column for the <i>Lawndale Lowdown</i>.
<p>Cut to Daria
<p>Daria: I just might do it, the next time Hellheim burns down.<a href="#9">9</a>
<p>Cut back to Mr. O'Neil
<p>Mr. O'Neil: (missing the clue)&nbsp; That's Great!&nbsp; I'll tell Jodie.
<p>Daria: (Thought Voice Over) Here we go again...
<p>Mr. O'Neil: (Resuming his lecture)&nbsp; The Utopians also think of
pleasure as the goal of man, before virtue.&nbsp; Of course they have a
hierarchy of pleasures.&nbsp; Sort of like the poetry rating system in
that literature textbook in <i>Dead Poets' Society</i>.&nbsp; Yes Kevin?
<p>Cut to Kevin
<p>Kevin: Wasn't that the one where Robin Williams played that messed up
teacher?
<p>Cut to a facefaulting Mr. O'Niel
<p>Cut To:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: Lawndale High School Hallway.&nbsp; Daria and Jane are walking
along in the hallway.
<p>Daria: Well, It looks like I'm going to talk to Jodie and straighten
things out.&nbsp; I would have thought that Mr. O'Neil would have been
a little more swift to that one.
<p>Jane:&nbsp; It could be worse.&nbsp; He could have volunteered you for
the jazz band.
<p>Daria:&nbsp; Right you are there, Jane.&nbsp; I wonder what Mr. Breeck
will say today.
<p>Jane: (In her impersonation voice again)&nbsp; And today we learn that
the Nazca lines were made by cobbling boulders and combing sand in the
desert, and they were <i>not</i> runways for extraplanetary craft. (Giggles)
<p>Daria: (in her Mona Lisa smile)&nbsp; Maybe Quinn should have him.&nbsp;
(Straight face again, pointing) Speak of the devil.
<p>Pan across the hall to:
<p>The Fashion Club (Sandi, Quinn, Tiffnay and Stacy) is collectively walking
along.
<p>Sandi: What's up, Quinn, I thought we were your <i>friends</i>.
<p>Quinn: You are, but...
<p>Sandi: But what?
<p>Quinn: Well, I remember what Aaron said.&nbsp; If I don't try to get
good grades so that I can get into a good school so that I can make a lot
of money, I won't be able to afford to stay fashionable.<a href="#10">10</a>
<p>Tiffany: Even if it means associating with geeks and <i>losers</i>?
<p>Quinn: Would you rather I have to buy <i>generic</i> brand shirts? <i>Generic</i>
brand makeup?
<p>Sandi:&nbsp; No, but college is at least two years off.&nbsp; Couldn't
you wait a little?
<p>Quinn:&nbsp; No, I couldn't.&nbsp; I need to get some studying done
now.
<p>Sand, Stacy, and Tiffany exchange looks, then nod their heads once.
<p>Stacy: Then we have no choice.
<p>Quinn: (Concerned Look on her face)&nbsp; A forced Fashion Sabbatical?
<p>Tiffany: Much worse.
<p>Sandi: Like, we're ejecting you from the Fashion Club.
<p>Quinn: (Begging) But I like it here, please let me stay.&nbsp; I'll
even wash your car.
<p>Sandi: That's too, too bad.
<p>Stacy and Tiffany, in chorus:&nbsp; Later.
<p>Sandi, Stacy, and Tiffany turn on their heels and walk in a different
direction.&nbsp; Quinn starts bawling.&nbsp; Pan back to Daria and Jane.
<p>Daria: Gee, did you see what I think I saw?
<p>Jane:&nbsp; I think so.
<p>Daria: I almost regret it.
<p>Jane: Why is that?
<p>Daria: Partially because it means that she'll have no more excuse to
call me her cousin.&nbsp; Partially it is because she got this for trying
to stand up to the mess she was making of her life.&nbsp; Mostly because
I'll have to listen to her bawling through the paper thin walls separating
our rooms.&nbsp; (Mona Lisa Smile) Literally paper thin.&nbsp; It's made
from fake stucco.
<p>Jane: Come on now.&nbsp; Remember when you dressed up to steal away
Joey, Jeffy, and Jamie?<a href="#11">11</a>
<p>Daria: That's different.&nbsp; Then she was trying to have her cake
and eat it too.&nbsp; Besides, I have to think about Tom.
<p>Jane: Look on the bright side.&nbsp; She'll probably take a couch trip
with Mrs. Manson and may even get into Mr. O'Niell's self esteem class.
<p>Daria: When my luck is good, it's wonderful.
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Chez Pierre.&nbsp; Daria and Tom are at a table, eating.
<p>Daria: (Between Bites) And so you have it.&nbsp; I now have Arthur Conan
Doyle for a history teacher and Miss Caturwall for a sister.&nbsp; If it
were a Friday, I would stay at Jane's.
<p>Tom: That's not too bad.&nbsp; I keep having problems with Elise.&nbsp;
It's just the same old story.
<p>Daria: But I'm worried.&nbsp; This could either turn her into someone
I might actually like having for a sister, or it could destroy her.
<p>Tom: Some interest in the welfare of another.&nbsp; Looks like you're
a human being after all.
<p>Daria: Not really.&nbsp; It's just the sooner she gets over with this
the fewer nights I'm up.&nbsp; That's all.
<p>Tom:&nbsp; Daria, about that teacher, what do you know about him?
<p>Daria: Next to nothing.&nbsp; Why?
<p>Tom: No reason.&nbsp; Just trying to change the subject.
<p>Daria:&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; I have a better idea for a subject.
<p>They kiss.
