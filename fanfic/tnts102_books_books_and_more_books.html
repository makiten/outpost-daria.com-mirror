<p>Opening Sequence:</center>

<p>Splendora's <i>You're Standing On My Neck</i> has been replaced by
<i>Man
on the Moon</i> by REM, and the following montage plays:
<p>Mr. Ben Breeck looks resigned.&nbsp; Pan over to his students, who include
Daria, Jane, Kevin, Brittany, Upchuck, and most of the rest of the gang
in Daria's class.
<p>Ben is in Principal Li's office, with narrowed eyes, and regards Li,
who is yakking in grandiose terms, with a look of tired incredulity.
<p>Pizza King.&nbsp; Ben is grading papers while hoisting a slice with
pepperoni, bacon, onions, anchovies, and sun dried tomatoes.&nbsp; Pan
to Daria, Jane, and Tom's booth.&nbsp; Daria is suspicious, Jane is startled,
and Tom's face is neutral.
<p>A dance. Ben approaches Claire DeFoe and says something.&nbsp; She blushes
and takes his hand.&nbsp; Pan to Upchuck with a camera snapping a picture.
<p>The classroom again.&nbsp; Mr. Breeck pulls a sleeping Kevin's face
up by his hair, removes some googly-eyed Groucho glasses from his face,
folds them, then drops Kevin's face back on his desk.&nbsp; Pan to Daria,
Jane, and Jodie's approving glances.
<p>The Zen.&nbsp; Mystik Spiral is thrashing on stage, and Trent is singing
like his life depends on it.&nbsp; Pan to the audience where one of the
patrons is Ben, who's looking rather unimpressed.
<p>Daria is at a street corner with Tom, who is speaking.&nbsp; He stops
talking, his tongue cleaving to the roof of his mouth.&nbsp; At the exact
same instant, she acquires a cold, angry look, says something between clinched
teeth, and stalks out of the shot.
<p>The Zen.&nbsp; Ben is up on stage and apparently doing a monologue.&nbsp;
Pan to the audience, which includes Daria, Jane, and Mystik Spiral.&nbsp;
Everybody is laughing except Daria.
<p>Close-up of Daria Smirking, which acquires an oval around it.&nbsp;

<br>A piece of Daria fan fiction by Benjamin Breeck
<br>Episode 102 of The New Teacher Series</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Scene: Lawndale High School.&nbsp; Daria and Jane are walking along
in the hall.
<p>Jane: So, how was the the first date of the rest of your relationship
with Tom?
<p>Daria: Not too bad, though I wish you wouldn't put it in quite those
terms.
<p>Jane: Not to bad, eh? Must have been better than any of mine, then.
<p>Daria: I'm not you, so I wouldn't know.&nbsp; (Points off screen) Would
you look at that?
<p>Pan to where Daria is pointing.&nbsp; Ben has a big cardboard box he
is balancing on his shoulders, maintain the shot as he walks past Daria
and Jane.&nbsp; Pan back to Daria and Jane.
<p>Daria: I think that this must mean our books have arrived.
<p>Jane: How long do you think before Mr. Breeck is called on the carpet
for a hose down?
<p>Daria: Oh, three weeks at the latest.&nbsp; I think that's when the
next school board bribe is due.
<p>Jane: Think they'll be more worth reading than the stuff we already
have?
<p>Daria: Well, considering that the standard textbooks have a most recent
copyright date of 1974, I think that that is quite within the realm of
possibility.
<p>Jane: I just <i>love</i> Li's spending priorities.
<p>Daria: (lips quirk into Mona Lisa smile)
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: Classroom.&nbsp; Ben is in front of the class.&nbsp; Today, he
is wearing a purple plaid flannel shirt and kakhi cargo pants.
<p>Ben: The new books have just arrived.&nbsp; (Bending over a box) I am
going to give them to you now&nbsp; Please take one of each and pass them
back.&nbsp; The one in the back of the row can then carry any spares back
to my desk.&nbsp; Oh, yeah, and could each of you please sign the attendance
sheet? (Hands a stack of paperback books to the first kid in the row)
<p>Pan to Jodie's desk.&nbsp; She is examining her books.&nbsp; She picks
one up.
<p>Jodie: What <i>is</i> this book?
<p>Quick Cut to Daria's Desk
<p>Daria: (Thought Voice Over) Let's see here, we have "Fantastic Archeology,"
"Elizabethan Propaganda: How Shakespeare's Historical Dramas Haunt History
Today," "101 Historical Facts Everybody Got Wrong," "Denying the Holocaust"
by Deborah Lipstadt, and "Loony Theorists of the Twentieth Century."&nbsp;
I think I'm impressed.<a href="#1">1</a>
<p>Cut to Ben
<p>Ben: Those are the rest of our textbooks.&nbsp; Don't worry, you will
only have to read them for the midterm and the final.&nbsp; Yes, Jane?
<p>Cut to Jane
<p>Jane: This is awfully long reading.
<p>Quick Cut to Ben
<p>Ben: True, but I think you can fit it in between now and May. (Beat)
Now, any more questions?&nbsp; (beat) Yes, Daria?
<p>Pan to Daria.
<p>Daria: Where did you get these?
<p>Cut to Ben.
<p>Ben: http://www.skeptics.org/bookstore/&nbsp; they give a 45% discount
on bulk purchases.<a href="#2">2</a>
<p>Cut to Daria.
<p>Daria: (Thoughtful look, Thought Voice Over)&nbsp; Maybe I ought to
check that place out.&nbsp; (in a more evil tone of thought voice over)
I wonder how Quinn's taking Esteem Class?
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: Mr.O'Neill's Room.&nbsp; Mr. O'Niell is up in front of the class.
<p>O'Neill: Welcome to our new Self Esteem Class this year.&nbsp; As you
know, I'm Timothy O'Niell, and here all of you will learn how to get along
with yourselves to get to know the youness within and banish that poor
self-esteem.&nbsp; Yes?
<p>Pan to an anonymous male student, wearing a Cincinnati Bengals T-shirt
and black denim pants.
<p>Student:&nbsp; You're sick, dude.&nbsp; I don't have no second personality
named Eunice.
<p>Cut to O'Neill
<p>O'Neill: (Smiling) I meant You-Ness.&nbsp; Y-O-U-N-E-S-S.<a href="#3">3</a>&nbsp;
(As he continues to talk, we cut to the student, who slaps his head.)&nbsp;
Anyway, I thought we could start by having everybody introduce himself
or herself.&nbsp; Lets start with you.
<p>Pan to another student, one which we have seen before.
<p>Other Student:&nbsp; Hi, I'm Robert Head, but people always call me
"Bobby Bighhead."&nbsp; According to Dr. Manson, I have low self-esteem.
<p>Pan to next student, Andrea
<p>Andrea: Hi, I'm Andrea Flynn, and I've just shattered Jane Lane's old
record for most appearances in this class.&nbsp; Maybe it's because I listen
to real hard rock and wear dark clothes.&nbsp; Maybe it's because Dr. Manson
is a dolt who follows the trends of psychology the way the Fashion Club
chases the latest fad in clothing and cosmetics.&nbsp; Myself, I think
this class is an idiotic waste of time that I could better spend in study
hall.<a href="#4">4</a>
<p>Pan to Quinn.
<p>Quinn: Hi I'm Quinn Morgendorffer, and I (starts to sound whiny) I just
got thrown out (Starts sobbing) of the <i>Fashion Club<a href="#5">5</a></i>.&nbsp;
(Is now bawling unintelligibly) Waahh!!&nbsp; Uuww Waahh!!
<p>Pan to Mr. O'Neill's shocked face.
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Pizza King.&nbsp; Daria, Jane, and Tom are at their usual booth.
<p>Tom: And so he says "I'll have Pompoms Frites."
<p>Jane laughs so hard she snorts out pizza sauce.&nbsp; Daria's lips quirk
into a Mona Lisa Smile.
<p>Tom: So, how were yours and Jane's day today, Daria?
<p>Daria: Well, we just doubled the number of textbooks we have to carry,
courtesy of Mr. Breeck
<p>Jane: I just broke in a new kiln for Ms. DeFoe.
<p>Daria: I straightened out things between myself, Jodie, and Mr. O'Niell
about the <i>Lawndale Lowdown</i>.&nbsp; It's <i>so</i> wonderful to see
a grown man cry.
<p>Tom: (pointing off screen) Speaking of Mr. Breeck, Daria, would you
say that that's him over there, based on your descriptions of him?
<p>Pan to a small table, where Ben is grading papers between bites of a
large thin crust with pepperoni, bacon, anchovies, and onions.&nbsp; Pan
back to the booth, where Daria and Jane have acquired shocked expressions.
<p>Jane: How could a <i>teacher</i> choose <i>pizza</i>?&nbsp; In the <i>afternoon</i>?
<p>Daria: And why <i>Pizza King</i>, of all places?
<p>Tom: Well, it's not as if we saw him at the Zen, now is it?
<p>Daria: (Thoughtful look) True.&nbsp; (Face twists into an expression
of suspicion)
<p>Jane: Daria, I don't like that look
<p>Daria: I swear I've seen him somewhere before.&nbsp; I just can't place
it.
<p>Pan over to Ben marking a paper while hoisting a slice.&nbsp; Pan back
to Tom, Daria, and Jane.
<p>Commercial Break: Stinger: Ben grading a paper at Pizza King.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: The Zen: Mystik Spiral is performing on stage, trying out a new
tune.&nbsp; Pan to the audience which includes Daria and Tom at one table,
and Jane and an (as yet) unknown guy with shoulder length blond hair, red
vinyl jacket, blue jeans and tennis shoes.&nbsp; (For the record, this
is NOT Wind Lane.<a href="#6">6</a>)
<p>Daria: Fancy meeting you here, Jane, and with a new beau, I see.
<p>Jane: Go to hell, Daria.
<p>Unknown Beau: Please, Jane.
<p>Jane: (to both Beau and Daria) I'm only kidding.&nbsp; Anyway, Isaac,
meet Daria and Tom, Tom and Daria, Isaac.
<p>Daria: (Deadpan) Hi.
<p>Tom: (A little friendlier) Hey.
<p>Isaac: (Definitely Friendly) Yo.
<p>Daria: So, where do you come from?
<p>Isaac: Originally, I'm from Indiana, but like the Hank Snow <a href="#7">7</a>
song, I've been everywhere.
<p>Daria: (with narrowed eyes) Indeed?
<p>Tom: (To Jane) So, where'd you meet him, or should I ask?
<p>Jane: Well, I was picking out some whole wheat spaghetti for Mom when
I bumped into him and we both fell down.
<p>Daria: (Interrupting) And it was love at first sight?
<p>Isaac: No, not really.&nbsp; I just barely bit back from cussing her
out.&nbsp; I was checking out the shrimp chips.&nbsp; I fell down and twisted
my ankle.&nbsp; She apologized and helped me to my car.
<p>Jane: As we were walking, we got to talking about various subjects.&nbsp;
Art, literature, movies, that sort of thing.
<p>Isaac: I never believed that anyone could be more in the dark about
the meaning of <i>Waiting for Gadot</i> than me!
<p>Daria: So something clicked?
<p>Jane: No.&nbsp; Then I met him again at <i>Box Office Video</i> three
days later.&nbsp; He helped me pick out a selection for that week's bad
movie night.&nbsp; That's where we hit it off.
<p>Isaac: When Craven does them good, he does them good.&nbsp; When he
does 'em bad...
<p>Daria: So you were the one who picked out <i>The Serpent and the Rainbow</i>?&nbsp;
(Looks up to the stage) Looks like the set's over. (Pan to the stage)
<p>Trent: We're Mystik Spiral, and we'll be back for another set. (To the
band) Okay guys, take ten.
<p>Max gets up from the drum set while Nick and Jesse un-sling their guitars
and place them on stands, then walk off stage.&nbsp; Cut to Daria, Tom,
Jane and Isaac as Trent walks over to them.
<p>Trent: Hi, Janey.&nbsp; Hi, Daria.&nbsp; Hi- (Does a double take at
Isaac) Whoa, Wind, is that you?
<p>Isaac:&nbsp; Who's Wind?
<p>Jane: He's our elder out of the house blond heartthrob of a brother.&nbsp;
Trent, let me introduce Isaac Bowman, my new boyfriend.&nbsp; Isaac, this
is my other elder brother, Trent.
<p>Trent: (offering his hand) Hey, Nice meeting you.
<p>Isaac: (shaking it) Any time.
<p>Trent: What did you think of the set?
<p>Isaac: Not too bad.&nbsp; Jesse, that guy with the base guitar, he can
really play.&nbsp; And that drummer Max has a good rhythm.&nbsp; Now, if
you really learn how to sing and the band can pull together as a band,
you could be the next Red Hot Chili Peppers.
<p>Trent: Really? (Nick comes up from off screen and whispers into Trent's
ear as Isaac nods his head.) Well thanks Isaac.&nbsp; Gotta get back on
stage.
<p>Daria: That was rather mean of you Isaac, pumping up their hopes like
that.
<p>Isaac: I meant every word I said.&nbsp; They really got potential.
<p>Daria: (Thought Voice Over) Jane, Jane, Jane, what have you gotten into?
(Out loud, to Tom) Tom, it's about my bedtime.
<p>Tom: Okay.&nbsp; Well, I'll see you tomorrow afternoon, Jane, and I
hope to see you again too, Isaac.
<p>Isaac: My shift at <i>Box Office</i> should be over by 4:00, tomorrow.
<p>Jane: Bye, Bye, Daria.
<p>Daria: See you.
<p>Daria and Tom exit the shot.&nbsp; Pan up on stage.
<p>Trent: Hello and welcome once again to the Zen.&nbsp; We're Mystik Spiral,
but we're thinking of changing the name.&nbsp; As you may recall, I'm Trent
Lane, that's Jesse Moreno on bass, Nick Campbell on rhythm guitar, and
Max Tyler is behind the drum set.&nbsp; This next song is one that got
us our new recording contract with the Trash Weasel label.&nbsp; Hit it.
<p>They begin playing <i>Freakin' Friends</i>
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: Morgendorffer Residence.&nbsp; Daria opens the door and begins
walking up the stairs.
<p>Helen: (Off screen) Daria!
<p>Daria: (Whirls around. Pan to put Helen into the shot with Daria) Mom!
<p>Helen: Do you know what time it is, and on a school night, at that?
<p>Daria: (sighing) It's only 9:30, well within the curfew, even on a school
night.
<p>Helen: You're starting to act like Quinn.
<p>Daria: (visibly irritated) And suddenly that's a bad idea?
<p>Helen: It is when it interferes with your studies.
<p>Daria: And you always want me to do those extracurricular activities
that interfere with my studies.
<p>Helen: But Daria, colleges love that sort of thing.
<p>Daria: No thanks to you, I joined the <i>Highland Howdy</i> as the fashion
reporter.&nbsp; It was a living hell of an assignment.
<p>Helen: Daria!
<p>Daria: Mom, I really don't want to talk about it right now.&nbsp; It's
near my bed time on a Thursday night.&nbsp; I'm going up to bed.
<p>Daria turns and exits the shot.&nbsp; Pan to shot of Daria ascending
the stairway.
<p>Helen: (off screen) Wait, Daria!
<p>Cut to:
<p>Scene: Daria in the upstairs hall.&nbsp; Quinn is wailing her voice
out.&nbsp; Daria stops by Quinn's room and bangs on the wall next to her
door, three sharp pounds.
<p>Daria: Cut it out, Quinn.
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Montage (Music: <i>Tossing and Turning</i>, by Ivy League):&nbsp; Daria
in her room, she turns out the light, lays down, and closes her eyes.&nbsp;
Close up as she opens them up again and sighs.
<p>Daria putting cotton balls in her ears.&nbsp; Close-up on her face as
she acquires an irritated expression.
<p>Daria throwing darts at a dartboard.&nbsp; Pan to the dartboard, where
Todd's face is at the bullseye, flanked by the faces of Quinn, Sandi, Upchuck,
and Principal Li.
<p>Daria playing <i>Doom </i>on her computer, with a mod that turns various
demons into members of the Fashion Club, B*witched, the Backstreet Boys,
98 Degrees, and Mr. Buzzcut.&nbsp; Daria's computer persona is wielding
the chainsaw.
<p>Daria reading <i>Flatland, a Romance of Many Dimensions</i> by Edward
Abbot while gritting her teeth.
<p>Daria playing Tetris at relativistic speed.
<p>Daria in front of her TV, looking extremely frazzled.&nbsp; There is
snow on the screen.&nbsp; She clicks the remote.&nbsp; Close up to the
screen as the <i>Sick Sad World</i> Globe and Eye display prominently.
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: Quinn's room. Quinn is sitting on her bed with her head resting
on her hands. Pan to the door, where Daria has just walked in.
<p>Daria: Could you please tone it down? It's three in the morning for
crying out loud.
<p>Quinn: (Lifts her head up. There are visible circles around her eyes.
Whether this is a result of crying or sleeplessness cannot be discerned.)
I'm sorry Daria. I can't sleep.
<p>Daria: (Walks over to Quinn's makeup table, grabs the chair, swings
it over to Quinn's bed and sits down in it backwards) Want to talk about
it?
<p>Quinn: Daria, why are you so concerned? It's really none of your business.
<p>Daria: Because your keening is keeping me from being rested for three
pop quizzes tomorrow and that padding in my room is rotten as sound insulation.
Now I'd advise taking my offer before I retract it.
<p>Quinn: It was because I decided to keep up this learning kick. When
they objected, I insisted I wanted to be able to afford to stay fashionable.
Then they kicked me out. (Whining) BUT THEY WERE MY FRIENDS.
<p>Daria: Are they really your friends? I would never treat Jane the way
Sandi's been treating you. Jane wouldn't treat me that way either. Hell,
even <i>I</i> wouldn't treat you that way.
<p>Quinn: But you stole Jane's boyfriend! You tried to steal Joey, Jeffy,
and Jamie! <a href="#8">8</a> I'd <i>never</i> do that to Sandi!
<p>Daria: Hey, that's different. <i>Tom</i> kissed <i>me</i>, <a href="#10">9</a>
without my consent, and I quickly told Jane about it. As for the other,
I was trying to remind you of what you would be missing if you chose the
path you were going down at that time. If you had given up on them, so
would I, and I would have been actually proud of you.
<p>Quinn: What about Stacy and Tiffany?
<p>Daria: What about them? You know far more about them than I do.
<p>Quinn: Well, Tiffany can't really see that she isn't fat, or on the
road to getting fat. Stacy is rather nice, but she booted me out along
with Sandi and Tiffany. (Whining) BUT I THOUGHT SHE WAS MY FRIEND!
<p>Daria: Well, she always seemed a little insecure, to me. She seems to
be weighing the friendship of two people against the friendship of just
one.
<p>Quinn: (Sarcastic) Thanks for the reminder, Daria.
<p>Daria: (Unfazed) What you need to do is unconvince her of the validity
of that math. Show her that to compare a single genuine friendship as not
worth two phony friendships is just the same thinking as believing Primo
to be better than Giorgio simply because of the lower price of the former.
<p>Quinn: But how do I do <i>that</i>?
<p>Daria: That is for you to figure out. (gets up) Now, get your beauty
rest so I can get mine. Oh, and one final thing.
<p>Quinn: Yes, Daria?
<p>Daria: When you've had enough of Timothy O'Niell during your study hall,
I have the answers to the self-esteem Exit Test if you want to cheat your
way out of the class. <a href="#10">10</a>
<p>Quinn: Thanks Daria.
<p>Daria: Don't mention it.
<p>Commercial Break.&nbsp; Stinger: Daria stuffing cotton balls up her
ears.
<p>Commercial:
<p><b><tt>Voice Over: On the next episode of The New Teacher series, Daria
finds an extracurricular activity that she actually likes.</tt></b>
<br><b><tt>Scene: Quinn walking outside.</tt></b>
<br><b><tt>Quinn: Like a game show run by the athletic association? Eww!</tt></b>
<br><b><tt>Voice Over: And her parents have a little explaining to do.</tt></b>
<br><b><tt>Scene: Morgendorffer Residence. Daria looking rather pissed
off.</tt></b>
<br><b><tt>Daria: You did <i>what</i> with that money?</tt></b>
<br><b><tt>Voice Over: All this and more! Next Week!</tt></b>
<p>End Commercial
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: Classroom:&nbsp; Mr. O'Neill is in front of the class.
<p>O'Neill: And so as those tapes said, there's always something that makes
each of us special.&nbsp; Yes, Quinn?
<p>Pan to Quinn:
<p>Quinn: Mr. O'Neill, could you please give me the test?
<p>Cut to O'Neill
<p>O'Neill: But Quinn, are you really ready, I mean, you seem to have made
a lot of progress.&nbsp; I wouldn't want you to get so depressed you backslide.
<p>Cut to Quinn
<p>Quinn: (With a broad smile) Oh, I think I'm ready.
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: Classroom: The lights are out and Ben is in front of the class,
commenting on a slide show.
<p>Ben: And so we see, It wasn't an act of God that thwarted the Assyrian
conquest of Judah, simply bad sanitation.&nbsp; (Bell Rings, Ben flips
on the lights)&nbsp; For over the weekend, I want you to debunk some historical
myth about the Ancient Greeks.&nbsp; And by the way I have your quizzes
here in the out box.
<p>Cut to shot of everyone grabbing a paper from a wire basket on Ben's
Desk, use several angles of it.&nbsp; Daria walks up to Ben.
<p>Ben: Uh, Why aren't you leaving, Daria?&nbsp; School's out for this
week.
<p>Daria: Could you answer me a question?
<p>Ben: Shoot.&nbsp; Is it about the course?
<p>Daria: Actually It's about you.&nbsp; Have you ever been to Highland?
<p>Ben: Highland?
<p>Daria: Trick Question.&nbsp; There are actually three Highlands in Texas<a href="#11">11</a>.&nbsp;
Before I moved here, I was a student at Highland High School in Erath County.
<p>Ben: Actually, I've never been to Texas before I moved here to teach
this year.&nbsp; Why do you ask?
<p>Daria: I swear I've seen you before.&nbsp; I just can't remember where.
<p>Ben: Now that you mention it, you yourself do look kinda familiar. (startled
look) Tell me, do you have an older sister who went to Clinton's first
inauguration <a href="#12">12</a> with those high scholars from Texas with
those two idiots who made Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis in <i>Strange Brew</i>
look like Albert Einstein and Enrico Fermi?
<p>Daria: Actually, that was me.&nbsp; And those two idiots were named
Beavis and Butthead.
<p>Ben: (Shocked) No Kidding? But you're seventeen!&nbsp; Then how...
<p>Daria: Am I still in high school after seven years?&nbsp; (Sour Expression)
You can blame the Erath County Board of Education for a second-rate acceleration
program and the Texas Division of Schools and Education and those jokers
in Austin for their inflexible graduation requirements. (Mona Lisa Smile)
You might say that I had my fill of school spirit over there. (Beat) Who
were you?
<p>Ben: I was part of the other high school to attend the inauguration,
the one from Kentucky.&nbsp; I saw you and them in the bookstore in Union
Station.&nbsp; At least, I believe that was you and them.
<p>Daria: Now I remember. I believe you had longer hair, no glasses or
mustache, and were wearing a green heavy coat.
<p>Ben: Yep, that's me.
<p>Daria: It's a good thing I was able to stop Beavis and Butthead's attempts
to come on to your girlfriend.
<p>Ben: (Deadpan) Yeah, I could have gotten expelled, sued, and charged
with two counts of first degree manslaughter.
<p>Daria: May I ask another personal question?
<p>Ben: You just did, and you can ask a fourth, as well.
<p>Daria: What was her name, if I'm not prying?
<p>Ben: Her name was Kim, and I was buying her a present. (trails off)
<p>Daria: What happened with her?
<p>Ben: (Regarding her with a haunted look) I don't want to talk about
it.
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: The sidewalk outside Lawndale High.&nbsp; Stacy Rowe is walking
home.
<p>Quinn: (Off Screen) Wait up, Stacy.
<p>Stacy: (looking over her shoulder) Quinn?
<p>Pan to Quinn running toward Stacy.&nbsp; Maintain the shot as Quinn
slows down and reaches Stacy.&nbsp; Keep Quinn and Stacy in the shot.
<p>Quinn: Listen Stacy.&nbsp; I know I was a little aloof...
<p>Stacy: What's that?
<p>Quinn: Distant, stuck up, snotty.
<p>Stacy: (quickly retorting, angrily) Yeah, you really were aloof then.
<p>They start walking.&nbsp; Maintain the shot.
<p>Stacy: (Angry Voice) Yeah, so, what's your point, Quinn?
<p>Quinn: (Visibly hurt)Stacy, I've always been there for you.&nbsp; I've
put in a good word when it looked like you were going to get kicked out
of the Fashion club.&nbsp; I've helped get you dates with the football
team.
<p>Stacy: (vague tone)I guess so.
<p>Quinn: The point is, why are you now turning away from me?
<p>Stacy: Well, I've known them so much longer.
<p>Quinn: But they treat you like dirt!&nbsp; Remember the time Sandi made
you shine her shoes for allegedly committing a fashion don't that turned
out to have been fully sanctioned by <i>Waif</i>?&nbsp; She didn't even
apologize even after we showed her the picture.&nbsp; Or that time Tiffany
borrowed your full bottle of mascara and then gave it back empty? Without
