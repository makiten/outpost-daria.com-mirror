<p>Opening Sequence:</center>

<p>Splendora's <i>You're Standing On My Neck</i> has been replaced by
<i>Man
on the Moon</i> by REM, and the following montage plays:
<p>Mr. Ben Breeck looks resigned.&nbsp; Pan over to his students, who include
Daria, Jane, Kevin, Brittany, Upchuck, and most of the rest of the gang
in Daria's class.
<p>Ben is in Principal Li's office, with narrowed eyes, and regards Li,
who is yakking in grandiose terms, with a look of tired incredulity.
<p>Pizza King.&nbsp; Ben is grading papers while hoisting a slice with
pepperoni, bacon, onions, anchovies, and sun dried tomatoes.&nbsp; Pan
to Daria, Jane, and Tom's booth.&nbsp; Daria is suspicious, Jane is startled,
and Tom's face is neutral.
<p>A dance. Ben approaches Claire DeFoe and says something.&nbsp; She blushes
and takes his hand.&nbsp; Pan to Upchuck with a camera snapping a picture.
<p>The classroom again.&nbsp; Mr. Breeck pulls a sleeping Kevin's face
up by his hair, removes some googly-eyed Groucho glasses from his face,
folds them, then drops Kevin's face back on his desk.&nbsp; Pan to Daria,
Jane, and Jodie's approving glances.
<p>The Zen.&nbsp; Mystik Spiral is thrashing on stage, and Trent is singing
like his life depends on it.&nbsp; Pan to the audience where one of the
patrons is Ben, who's looking rather unimpressed.
<p>Daria is at a street corner with Tom, who is speaking.&nbsp; He stops
talking, his tongue cleaving to the roof of his mouth.&nbsp; At the exact
same instant, she acquires a cold, angry look, says something between clinched
teeth, and stalks out of the shot.
<p>The Zen.&nbsp; Ben is up on stage and apparently doing a monologue.&nbsp;
Pan to the audience, which includes Daria, Jane, and Mystik Spiral.&nbsp;
Everybody is laughing except Daria.
<p>Close-up of Daria Smirking, which acquires an oval around it.&nbsp;

<br>A Piece of Daria Fan Fiction By Ben Breeck
<br>Episode 103 of The New Teacher Series.</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Scene: Lawndale High.&nbsp; Daria and Jane are walking through the hall.
<p>Daria: So, which emotion did you pick out of Mr. O'Neill's Hat?
<p>Jane: Anger, and you?
<p>Daria: Shame.
<p>Jane: Ain't English IV something else?
<p>Daria: Yeah, not even Van Driessen was this pathetic.
<p>Upchuck: (Off screen) Hey girls, want to take a cruise on this love
boat? Growr.
<p>Pan to Upchuck. Pan back to Daria and Jane's hostile faces.
<p>Daria: Careful, Upchuck, you might run into a glacier and sink.
<p>Cut to Upchuck
<p>Upchuck (grinning lecherously): Ooh, Feisty.
<p>Pan Back to Daria and Jane
<p>Jane: We really don't have time for this.
<p>Daria: I'll take care of it.&nbsp; (Walks over to Upchuck.&nbsp; Maintain
the shot as Daria reaches him.)
<p>Upchuck tries to cop a feel.&nbsp; Daria grabs him by the crotch.
<p>Daria: (Conversational tone) Upchuck, please don't take this the wrong
way, but I really don't like you.&nbsp; I despise you.&nbsp; I think that
you are a sleaze who needs to learn what it means to be made an object
of before you can be fit to join the majority of humanity.&nbsp; If I wasn't
already attached to someone, I would teach that lesson myself.&nbsp; I
suggest you beg to learn from Andrea or maybe Ms. Barch.&nbsp; In the meantime,
if you dare to speak to me as if I were a potential one night stand at
a singles bar, or try to touch me, anywhere, regardless of the reason,
I'll castrate you and make you eat your nuts.&nbsp; Then, I'll get <i>really</i>
unreasonable.&nbsp; Do we have an agreement?
<p>Upchuck: (Nods his head) Yipe!
<p>Daria: (Releasing his crotch as she pushes him down and walks toward
Jane) That'll keep him at bay until report cards come out.
<p>Upchuck scrambles up and exits the shot.
<p>Jane: It's a pity his memory doesn't last longer.
<p>Daria: He's like a dog.&nbsp; You gotta punish him when he makes the
mess.<a href="#1">1</a>
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: Classroom.&nbsp; Anthony DeMartino is in front of the class.
<p>DeMartino: And I would LIKE to CONGRATULATE Quinn MORGENDORFFER, The
ONLY student in THIS class who got last week's question RIGHT. For the
RECORD, the MUNICH Beer Hall PUTSCH was NOT a particularly nasty BREED
of DOG.
<p>Pan to Quinn, Stacy, Sandi, and Tiffany.
<p>Sandi: Well, Quinn, you seem to be taking being a brain pretty well.
<p>Stacy: (to Sandi) Cut it out, Sandi.&nbsp; There are far worse things
than being a brain.
<p>Sandi: Now you're siding with this loser too?
<p>Quinn: She is just being a real friend.&nbsp; Ever heard of such a creature?
<p>Sandi: Stacy, if you keep on doing this, I'll have to put you on fashion
sabbatical.
<p>Stacy: I don't care.&nbsp; From now on, there'll be no more Fashion
Club! I resign.
<p>Sandi: You can't do that, you'll lose your boyfriends.
<p>Tiffany: Yeah, like Chad.&nbsp; Remember him?
<p>Quinn: Oh, I think we can find more.&nbsp; I was beautiful before I
joined the Fashion Club.&nbsp; I still am.&nbsp; And Stacy will still be
too.
<p>Sandi: You're just dragging Stacy down with you, Quinn.&nbsp; The Fashion
Club has a school charter.
<p>Quinn: A Fashion Club of two is much less believable than a Fashion
Club of four.&nbsp; Good luck. (Beat, faces the front of the room) The
female equivalent of the Hitler Youth was the Bund Deutschen Maedel.
<p>Pan to DeMartino
<p>DeMartino: Very GOOD, Morgendorffer.&nbsp; You even PRONOUNCED it RIGHT.
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: The cafeteria.&nbsp; Daria and Jane are eating Beefaroni, corn
kernels, and some unidentifiable green stuff.
<p>Daria:&nbsp; Jane, I'm not sure about Isaac.
<p>Jane: Whoa, Daria.&nbsp; The last time you weren't sure about my boyfriend
you stole him.<a href="#2">2</a>
<p>Daria: (mildly irritated) Jane...
<p>Jane: Sorry, sorry.&nbsp; Didn't mean it like that.&nbsp; What's not
to like about him?
<p>Daria: Well, for starters, he thinks Mystik Spiral might actually make
it to Alterapalooza, (beat) as a featured attraction.
<p>Jane: Come on now.&nbsp; They aren't that bad.&nbsp; They're now recording
on plastic with Trash Weasel.<a href="#3">3</a>&nbsp; Should be released
just in time for Christmas.
<p>Daria: Trash Weasel would sign my Grandma Ruth.
<p>Jane: (Smirking) Might this be a sign of sour grapes?
<p>Daria: Never.
<p>Jodie: (Off Screen) Hey Daria.
<p>Daria: (wheeling around) The answer is no, Jodie.
<p>Pan slightly to put Jodie in the shot.
<p>Jodie: That's rather rude.&nbsp; I haven't even told you what it is
I'm offering.
<p>Jane: (To Daria) Daria, at least hear her out.
<p>Daria: You can still tell me, it's just that the answer is already no.
<p>Pan and Zoom to Close up of Jodie
<p>Jodie: Ok, have you ever heard of the Academic Team<a href="#4">4</a>,
Daria?
<p>Cut to Daria.
<p>Daria: (Deadpan) Yeah, sure. I'll be Valedictorian, You, Mack, and Upchuck
will be Salutatorians, and Jane, Ted, and Andrea will be the Cum Laudes.&nbsp;
And in six years at our first reunion, our glorious returns will bring
honor to LAWNDALE HIGH.
<p>Cut to Jodie.
<p>Jodie: That's not quite what I meant.&nbsp; Basically they face other
high school's teams in competition.&nbsp; In the first part, we take twenty
question tests on one of six subjects: Math, Literature, Humanities, History,
Social Studies, and Sciences.&nbsp; In the second, the top five in each
subject on both teams square off against each other in fifteen minute rounds,
one each subject.&nbsp; Imagine <i>Greed</i>, but with two teams and no
calling someone out.
<p>Cut to Daria and Jane.
<p>Daria: And I should be interested in this for what reason?
<p>Jane: Come on.&nbsp; You keep saying about how those people only looked
at you for your beautiful face.&nbsp; This is a chance to be be noticed
for something other than looks.
<p>Daria: Well, I don't know...
<p>Jodie: At the end of the season and state finals, the individual winner
in each subject gets a $2000 scholarship to the school of his or her choice.&nbsp;
If the winner sweeps the subjects, the scholarship jumps to $20,000.&nbsp;
Then there are, or might be, the All A and National Tournaments.&nbsp;
Free Airfare and&nbsp; accommodations to all participants in the Nationals
in Indianapolis.
<p>Jane: Think about the inspirations!&nbsp; Think about the fun.&nbsp;
And Isaac is from Indiana.&nbsp; He could show us around.
<p>Daria: (to Jane) Indiana's a big place.&nbsp; He could be from Corydon,
South Bend, or anywhere in between. (to Jodie) When is that tournament?
<p>Pan to put Jodie back in the shot.
<p>Jodie: It's in early April, why?
<p>Daria: (to Jane) That gives us seven months.&nbsp; Do you think he'll
still be here in seven months?&nbsp; Do you even think you'll still love
him in seven months?
<p>Jane: Why don't we play it by ear on this one, Ok?&nbsp; Besides, I
think it'll be fun.&nbsp; Think of it as practicing for your session in
the hot seat with Regis Philbin.
<p>Daria: (Mona Lisa Smile) Actually, I much prefer <i>Ben Stein's Money</i>.&nbsp;
Much less of a prize, even after taxes, but more real challenge in the
questions.&nbsp; (beat, serious tone) I have three questions before I decide.&nbsp;
Number one: Why do you want me <i>this</i> year?
<p>Jodie: Well, it's because in previous years we were so bad even Carter
County High routinely blew us out of the water.&nbsp; You could have gotten
on and it still have made much of a difference, it was so bad.&nbsp; This
year, our team has gotten some new blood, and with you in, we may even
get to the regional championships.&nbsp; Our only real competition in this
district would be from Oakwood and Grove Hills. (beat) And you know how
I hate losing to them.
<p>Daria: Jodie, in football and basketball, Lawndale High, Oakwood High,
Carter County and Grove Hills <i>are</i> the whole of the 124th district.
<p>Jodie: Believe me, everyone else in the region is a pushover.
<p>Daria: I see.&nbsp; Next question: what's the schedule like?
<p>Jodie: Just like basketball.&nbsp; Formal study sessions begin in October.&nbsp;
Matches begin in November.&nbsp; Ten matches against anyone in the state,
then after the new year, regional play.&nbsp; We play everyone in our district
twice; once here and once there, and everyone else in our region once,
with the All A tournament at mid-season.&nbsp; Thus a regular season of
thirty matches.&nbsp; Then come the District, Regional, State, and if we
are really lucky, Nationals, but Lawndale High has never been to those.
<p>Daria:&nbsp; I see.&nbsp; Finally, I would like to ask, why <i>me</i>?
<p>Jodie:&nbsp; Daria, I know you.&nbsp; It's not that you aren't competitive,
I've seen you in the arcades.&nbsp; It's just that you've never seen anything
at this school worth being competitive in this school over.&nbsp; This
isn't about strength or looks, its about brains.&nbsp; And another thing,
you don't particularly thrive under pressure, but I've never seen you choke.
<p>Daria: (Deadpan) Well, in Highland, I choked Beavis and Butthead repeatedly.
(beat, resigned tone) Ok, you've convinced me.&nbsp; I'll sign up with
Mr. O'Neill right after lunch.
<p>Jane: This is intriguing.&nbsp; I'll sign up too.&nbsp; If nothing else,
I can sketch the quick recall rounds.
<p>Jodie: Actually, Mr. Breeck is handling the academic team this year.&nbsp;
Between Drama Horizons, the esteem class, and the Student Government, Mr.
O'Neill just doesn't have the time to coach it this year.
<p>Daria: (Raises a single eyebrow)
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: Classroom.&nbsp; Ben is in front of the class.
<p>Ben: Now, then. I would like to congratulate Daria on the myth she chose
to debunk.&nbsp; I think that it is very important to realize that not
only were women excluded from the vote in Athens, but also paupers and
those not born in Athens, even if they bore arms for that city. (Beat)
With that out of the way, lets get on to Alexander The Great.&nbsp; The
truth was that he wasn't that great a general.&nbsp; There simply hadn't
been a competent infantry force to come out of the Fertile Crescent since
the Assyrians.&nbsp; Nor did he face millions with his mere thirty thousand.&nbsp;
The biggest engagement only had 200,000 people fighting each other.&nbsp;
Yes, Brittany?
<p>Brittany: Did he really marry Roxanne?
<p>Ben: Yes, he did.
<p>Bell Rings
<p>Ben: Class Dismissed.&nbsp; For Tomorrow, I want you to read chapters
five, six, and seven and do the definitions at the end of five and seven.
<p>Pan to shot of class filing out of the classroom. Pan back to the desks,
where Daria and Jane remain.&nbsp; Cut to Ben.
<p>Ben: Daria, School's out.
<p>Cut to Daria and Jane.
<p>Daria: I know that.&nbsp; I want to talk to you again.
<p>Cut to Ben.
<p>Ben: I really don't want to relive old times because, well, we didn't
really have any.<a href="#5">5</a>
<p>Cut to Daria and Jane.
<p>Daria: I know that.&nbsp; I want to join the academic team.
<p>Jane: Me too.
<p>Cut to Ben.
<p>Ben: Yes, there is a god!&nbsp; Thank you Daria, you've just made my
day.
<p>Cut to Daria and Jane
<p>Daria: Is there any reason you are doing a Timothy O'Neill impression?
<p>Cut to Ben.
<p>Ben: Well, it's just that we need someone to captain this squad.&nbsp;
The previous captain resigned her post, though not from the team.&nbsp;
Had to balance her priorities, she said, and I believe it.&nbsp; The only
real candidate so far, is a good competitor, but a bad example to the rest
of the team.&nbsp; He's the only A student I ever toy with giving Saturday
school just on general principals.&nbsp; She suggested you.
<p>Cut to Daria and Jane's facefaults.
<p>Daria: (Shocked) You mean Jodie had an ulterior motive and wanted me
to compete with Upchuck for team captain?
<p>Ben: (sighing) If by Upchuck you mean Charles Ruttheimer, yes.
<p>Daria: (coldly) All that goodwill gained at Grove Hills<a href="#6">6</a>
is completely gone, then.
<p>Ben: Daria, I want to tell you a story.&nbsp; When I was a senior at
Frankfort High, I was just like you, except that I was a guy, of course.&nbsp;
I was smart, cynical, and an outcast.&nbsp; And I didn't mind one bit.&nbsp;
Then my English teacher Mrs. Robinson came to me and talked me into the
academic team there.&nbsp; (smile) Mostly it was because study sessions
were held at Mr. Gatti's during the buffet.&nbsp; There, I met a few friends.&nbsp;
Real friends, who liked me for my mind.&nbsp; We went on the district,
regional, and state championships, and while we didn't win or even get
into the Elite Eight, we were never blown out either. (beat) Though we
did do quite a bit of blowing out ourselves.<a href="#7">7</a>
<p>Daria: Oh, I think I already have enough friends, but I'll join anyway,
if only to one up Upchuck and rub Jodie's nose in it.
<p>Jane: Me, Too
<p>Ben: Great.&nbsp; I'll get the paperwork started.
<p>Commercial Break. Stinger: Daria and Jodie Talking.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: Sidewalk, walking home.&nbsp; Daria and Jane are walking home
sharing a computer printout they are reading.
<p>Jane: (reading) Quick Recall round.&nbsp; Each round lasts fifteen minutes
per subject.&nbsp; The referee asks a tossup question that anyone can answer
by buzzing in first.&nbsp; It is worth ten points and the correct answered
gets a follow-up question worth fifteen points, which only the team captain
can answer.&nbsp; If you buzz in before the question is fully asked and
get it wrong, your team team is penalized ten points and the question is
read fully for the other team.<a href="#8">8</a>
<p>Daria: Sounds reasonable.&nbsp; I think I might like this after all.
(face hardens) But damn Jodie for her methods.
<p>Jane: It could have been worse.&nbsp; She could have volunteered you
without your knowing.
<p>Daria: Oh, I don't think she'd have struck that low, at least not this
year.&nbsp; If we were at college, though, it might be a different story.&nbsp;
(Glancing forward) Hey, Quinn, you wanna enlarge your social contacts?
<p>Pan to Quinn and Stacy
<p>Quinn: How, Daria?
<p>Cut to Daria.
<p>Daria: Look at this.&nbsp; (Hands printout to Quinn)
<p>Cut to Quinn:
<p>Quinn: (Reading) What is this?
<p>Cut to Daria.
<p>Daria: Well basically, it's six rounds of questions and answers moderated
by someone with a cue card.
<p>Cut to Quinn and Stacy
<p>Quinn: Like a game show run by the athletic association? Eww!
<p>Stacy: You said it Quinn.
<p>Cut to Daria and Jane.
<p>Daria: Well, suit yourself.
<p>Jane: It's your loss.
<p>Cut to:
<p>Scene: Morgendorffer residence, exterior.&nbsp; Daria opens the door,
and enters the house.&nbsp; Cut to front hall and family room.&nbsp; Jake
is in his easy chair, watching some talk show.&nbsp; Daria enters and shuts
the front door.
<p>Jake: (sounding more nervous than usual) How are you doing, kiddo?
<p>Daria: Ok, except for losing a friend and joining an extracurricular
activity.
<p>Jake: (Enthusiastically) Really, this calls for a celebration!&nbsp;
(Grabs the telephone off the stand and presses a speed dial button.)
<p>Daria: (Off screen) I don't see any reason to celebrate my alienation
from someone.
<p>Jake (holding the phone up to his ear) I isn't that Jane girl, now is
it? (beat) Hello, Marianne, I want you to get Helen.
<p>Daria: No, it wasn't Jane.
<p>Jake: I'm sorry pumpkin.&nbsp; But your getting into an extracurricular
activity is wonderful news.&nbsp; (beat) Helen, Daria just got into an
extra curricular activity. (beat)&nbsp; Yes, that is wonderful. (beat)
That would be perfect.&nbsp; (hangs up)&nbsp; Guess what, Helen's coming
home!&nbsp; This is the second piece of good news today and we're celebrating
by getting the buffet at the Lucky Dragon.
<p>Daria: (Sounding Frustrated) Didn't you hear what I said?&nbsp; I lost
a good friend.
<p>Jake: Don't worry, kiddo. (beat) Say, who was that friend?
<p>Cut to Daria.
<p>Daria: It was Jodie.
<p>Cut to Jake.
<p>Jake: I'm sorry, hon.&nbsp; But here's something to cheer you up.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I just discovered this account we didn't know we had!&nbsp; (Pan to Daria's
shocked face as Jake continues talking, then cut back to Jake)&nbsp; There
must have been $3500 in it!&nbsp; More than enough for two CDs and a couple
lots of stock.&nbsp; In six more months, if all goes well, we'll be able
to tell the bank to go kiss off!
<p>Cut to an obviously pissed Daria.
<p>Daria: You did <i>what</i> with that money?
<p>Cut to Jake.
<p>Jake: We put it in two certificates of deposit and some shares of a
stock called Pinkmonkey.com, why, Daria?&nbsp; Daria?
<p>Pan to the stairs, where Daria is stomping up them.
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: Daria's room.&nbsp; Daria is dialing a number on the phone in
there.&nbsp; She puts it to her ear.
<p>Daria: (sounding desperate) Hello, Tom? (beat) Well, please get me Tom,
Elise. (Pause) Hello, Tom?
<p>Split screen between Daria's Room and Tom in the Kitchen.
<p>Tom: Yes, Daria?
<p>Daria: What sort of homework do you have?
<p>Tom: At this point, I'm reading Plato's <i>Apology</i> and am trying
to separate out what Socrates was saying from what, if anything, Plato
was putting into Socrates' mouth.&nbsp; Why?
<p>Daria: How soon can you get finished?
<p>Tom: About an hour.&nbsp; What about you?
<p>Daria: I'll be done in an hour, too.&nbsp; Why don't you pick me up
around seven?
<p>Tom: Sure, Daria.&nbsp; What's this about?
<p>Daria: I'll tell you when you take me away.
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: Daria and Tom are a Thai restaurant.&nbsp; Daria is eating Chicken
Penang Curry.&nbsp; Tom is eating Devil's Pork.
<p>Daria: And to top it all off, Dad recieved a statement from my Montana
Cabin Fund misaddressed to Mom, then with Mom's blessing, raided it.
<p>Tom: Huh? Even your Nutty Nutty pay?<a href="#9">9</a> I thought they
couldn't do it.
<p>Daria: (Between Clinched Teeth) According to their rules, until my eighteenth
birthday next march, all my accounts are paritally my parents' if they
bank there, which they now do. (Sighs)
<p>Tom: What did they do with the money?
<p>Daria: They sank it into penny stock .com that sounds like a pump and
dump.&nbsp; Oh, and some cds.&nbsp; They want to pay off the mortgage in
time for me to graduate.&nbsp; So there you have it.&nbsp; First Jodie
does the hard sell on me, then my parents find and mismanage my Montana
Cabin Fund.&nbsp; I wonder if I can divorce my parents?
<p>Tom: Not in Texas. (sounding bitter) At least they didn't send you to
prep school.
<p>Daria: Small comfort.
<p>Tom: Look at it this way, now we can go out a whole bunch of new places
after your matches.
<p>Daria: But what about college?<a href="#10">10</a>
<p>Tom: Hey, I CLEPPed out of my entire freshman year.&nbsp; Right now,
I have a 4.0 grade point average until the end of the semester, and I am
only taking twelve hours, all in the morning.&nbsp; Don't worry.
<p>Daria: Okay, I won't.&nbsp; So, what do I do now?
<p>Tom: Well, unless the schedule pits you against Highland High, I think
you should go with it.
<p>Daria: Okay.
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: Ben's Mobile Home.&nbsp; Ben is sitting in a padded easy chair,
talking on the phone.
<p>Ben: Okay, now, It's Lawndale vs. Fielding Prep for the opener, then
Southwest Springs, Then Sam Houston Academy, then First Impression, and
finally Danforth County High just before Christmas?&nbsp; I see... (Beat)
And the rest of the schedule will be in in the next two weeks?&nbsp; Thank
you. (hangs up, picks up the tv remote and clicks it.)<a href="#11">11</a>
<p>Pan and zoom in to the Television Screen.&nbsp; People are wandering
around stoned in a downpour.
<p><i>Sick Sad World</i> Announcer:&nbsp; You won't believe what that new
jet fuel additive is doing to the clouds!&nbsp; We expose the worst sort
of acid rain next on <i>Sick Sad World</i>.
<p>Pan out to Daria's room.&nbsp; Daria is watching the show while talking
on the phone.
<p>Daria: Rachel? Could you please get me Jodie?&nbsp; This is important,
Rachel. (Beat) Ah, Jodie.&nbsp; The woman of the hour.
<p>Split screen between Daria's Room and Jodie's at the Landon residence.
<p>Jodie: (Yawning) What is it, Daria?&nbsp; I'm going to go to sleep soon.
<p>Daria: Jodie, you set me up.&nbsp; It's one thing that you convince
me to join this activity that you've hyped up so much, it's quite another
to make me sub for your place.&nbsp; I don't think I've been so angry since
Quinn made me take her babysitting job when she was double booked.&nbsp;
And even then I at least got some cash out of that.
<p>Jodie: What else was I supposed to do?&nbsp; Mack's too busy with football
and then hockey.&nbsp; Tell me, would <i>you</i> want to inflict Upchuck
on the rest of the team?
<p>Daria: It's not your goals, it's your methods.
<p>Jodie: Daria, if I told you up front, would you have agreed to it?
<p>Daria: Probably not, but still.&nbsp; I thought you were my friend.
<p>Jodie: Daria, I'm terribly sorry.&nbsp; I'll make it up to you somehow.
<p>Daria: (conversational tone) Oh well, done is done.&nbsp; You've still
pissed away all my goodwill from Grove Hills, by the way.&nbsp; Good night,
Jodie. (hangs up)
<p>We spend a few seconds watching Daria watching the show.
<p>Daria: (thought voice over) So, that explains that hurricane last year,
and why everyone was singing.
<p>Commercial Break. Stinger: Daria Looking Pissed.

<br><b><tt>Jane: Didn't you tell me about him?</tt></b>
<br><b><tt>Voice Over: All this and more, next week!</tt></b>
<p>End Commercial:
<p>Scene: Daria is in front of the class, reading.
<p>Daria:&nbsp; I didn't really understand how much I hurt her, until I
talked to her again two months later.&nbsp; I realize that it wasn't all
or even mostly my fault, but what fault of mine burned.&nbsp; Up to that
point, I had never understood the sort of trust I had betrayed, or the
sort of betrayal I had committed.&nbsp; I seriously doubted I could ever
get that friend back, and when she forgave me, it felt like a camel had
been lifted off my shoulders.&nbsp; I must be incredibly lucky, but I will
never take that luck for granted.<a href="#12">12</a>
<p>Pan to Mr. O'Neill
<p>O'Neill:&nbsp; Daria, That was wonderful.&nbsp; You get an A.
<p>Pan to a blushing Daria, pan back to O'Niell
<p>O'Neill:&nbsp; Next up is Jane Lane.&nbsp; Jane Drew out Anger.&nbsp;
Jane, would you like to give your essay?
<p>Cut to Jane getting up and walking to the front of the class.&nbsp;
Jane turns around and faces the class.
<p>Jane: This is especially hard for me.&nbsp; When my last boyfriend and
I broke up, it was as if someone had poked a blunt metal rod through my
ribcage.&nbsp; (as Jane continues to speak, we pan around the classroom)
What made it worse, though, was that my best friend was part of the reason
for the breakup.&nbsp; It happened that my boyfriend had kissed her during
one of those long talks they had begun to have every so often.&nbsp; If
breaking up was like a blunt rod through the ribcage, her participation
in it was as if someone had heated a fire poker to forging temperature
and stuck it, well, where it would hurt all the worse.<a href="#13">13</a>
<p>Cut to the clock, with the second hand flying around the face five times
in as many seconds and the minute hand moving forward five notches.&nbsp;
Cut to Jane.
<p>Jane: But I managed to forgive him.&nbsp; If he wanted to date someone
so that he could make a good money match, he wasn't worth fighting over.<a href="#14">14</a>&nbsp;
I forgave my friend, though I question her wisdom in keeping him.&nbsp;
I even found it in my heart to forgive that lesbian alley cat at the art
colony,<a href="#15">15</a> as she was simply a creature of the system
and her nature.&nbsp; I suppose I'm not the type to bear grudges well.&nbsp;
The End.
<p>Cut to Mr. O'Neill.
<p>O'Neill:&nbsp; That was simply breathtaking.&nbsp; Maybe I should enroll
you and Daria in that new <i>Waif</i> contest.
<p>Cut to Daria and Jane.
<p>Daria and Jane: (in chorus) No!
<p>Cut to Mr. O'Neill
<p>O'Neill: Well, it was worth a shot.&nbsp; Next, is Charles, who drew
fear.&nbsp; Charles?
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: Exterior Shot of Burger World (No, not in Highland) Cut to interior
shot at a door. Daria and Jane enter.
<p>Jane: You sure this is the place?
<p>Daria: Yeah, I'm sure.&nbsp; Mr. Breeck only made me repeat it four
times.&nbsp; Look, there they are.
<p>Jane: But study doesn't begin for another two weeks.
<p>Daria: I think that this is more to hand out the final schedule than
anything else.
<p>Jane: And it's the last chance to chicken out.
<p>Pan to a table where Upchuck, Jodie, Ted, Andrea, and some unidentified
students are talking with each other.&nbsp; Daria and Jane walk into the
shot and sit down as far from Upchuck as they can at the table.&nbsp; Ben
walks over with some meal and sits down at another empty chair.
<p>Ben: (Looking Around), well it looks like we have everybody.&nbsp; I
believe I know all of you except you. (Points to character whom we saw
last in our previous episode where he was interrupting Mr. O'Neill.&nbsp;
Pan to him.)
<p>Student: (Sarcastic) Hi, I'm Derrick Farland, and my hobbies are- oops,
wrong teacher.&nbsp; I'm only doing this because my mom is making me, that
old battleaxe.&nbsp; My strengths, such as they are, are in science and
mathematics.&nbsp; (Beat) And I'm not looking forward to this season.
<p>Pan to Ben.
<p>Ben: (Looking at Derrick sideways) Thank you, Derrick.&nbsp; (producing
a stack of papers) Now, here are the schedules for the season. (Passing
them out)
<p>Pan around the table, with thought voice overs as we put them into the
shot.
<p>Upchuck: (Smiling lecherously at the schedule) Hmm, Immaculate Conception
High School, the girls are as feisty as ever there, I hear.
<p>Jodie: Houston science magnet school? I do believe Mom and Dad were
trying to send me there.&nbsp; I want to show them!
<p>Ted: Southern Methodist Academy? Didn't Mom and Dad want me to go there?
<p>Andrea: Oh dear, another year of idiots cutting me down.&nbsp; I wonder
why I even bother?
<p>Anonymous Student 1: (Male, black hair, and sunglasses) Who came up
with the first ten schools?
<p>Anonymous Student 2: (Female, wears shades, and has rainbow striped
hair) Carter County High? I think it's time to pay them back for that toilet
papering!
<p>Anonymous Student 3: (Male, Black [Not Mack] wears clothes out of <i>Details</i>
magazine) I wonder who'll be in the all "A" Tournament this year?
<p>Jane: (smirking) Is Mr. Breeck trying to schedule the toughest teams
he could find?
<p>Daria: Fielding Prep?&nbsp; Isn't that Tom's Alma Mater?
<p>Pan Back to Ben.
<p>Ben: Our other business is electing the team captain and vice captains.&nbsp;
This election was prompted by the resignation of Jodie, here.
<p>Pan to a blushing Jodie.&nbsp; Pan back to Ben.
<p>Ben: Any nominations?
<p>Pan to Anonymous Student 1
<p>Anonymous Student 1: I nominate Upchuck.
<p>Pan Back to Ben
<p>Ben: Ok, Kyle.&nbsp; And you?
<p>Pan to Jodie
<p>Jodie: I nominate Daria.
<p>Pan Back to Ben
<p>Ben: Any one else? (Beat) Anybody? (Beat) Anybody at all?&nbsp; Ok,
let's vote. All those in favor of Charles Rutheimer III, raise your hands.
(Beat) Now All those in favor of Daria Morgendorffer, raise your hands.
(Beat) Well Daria, looks like you've won.&nbsp; Congratulations.
<p>Pan to a bored Daria.
<p>Daria: (Deadpan) Whoopty-Doo.
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Split Screen between Daria and Tom talking on the phone.
<p>Daria:&nbsp; And so I'm now the captain of the Academic Team.
<p>Tom: You could have declined the captaincy and nobody would have gainsaid
you.
<p>Daria: True, but I simply couldn't inflict Upchuck on the team.&nbsp;
It wouldn't have been fair to Jane or Andrea.
<p>Tom: And you are thrilled to a peanut?
<p>Daria: (sighing) Exactly.&nbsp; So, The opening match will be eight
weeks from today.&nbsp; Who are you going to cheer for, anyway?
<p>Tom: Well, since you asked, you.&nbsp; I never wanted to go to Fielding
Prep.&nbsp; I never liked the teachers or most of the students, and I never
cared to follow them in any sport.
<p>Daria: But won't your father be angry?
<p>Tom: Dad? the only things he cares about are money and influence, and
that's it.
<p>Daria: I see. (Beat) Well, Mystik Spiral is playing at some new place,
Saturday, called the Whole in the Wall.&nbsp; Want to make it a date?
<p>Tom: Sure.
