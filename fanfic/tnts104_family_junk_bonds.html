<p>Opening Sequence:</center>

<p>Splendora's <i>You're Standing On My Neck</i> has been replaced by
<i>Man
on the Moon</i> by REM, and the following montage plays:
<p>Mr. Ben Breeck looks resigned.&nbsp; Pan over to his students, who include
Daria, Jane, Kevin, Brittany, Upchuck, and most of the rest of the gang
in Daria's class.
<p>Ben is in Principal Li's office, with narrowed eyes, and regards Li,
who is yakking in grandiose terms, with a look of tired incredulity.
<p>Pizza King.&nbsp; Ben is grading papers while hoisting a slice with
pepperoni, bacon, onions, anchovies, and sun dried tomatoes.&nbsp; Pan
to Daria, Jane, and Tom's booth.&nbsp; Daria is suspicious, Jane is startled,
and Tom's face is neutral.
<p>A dance. Ben approaches Claire DeFoe and says something.&nbsp; She blushes
and takes his hand.&nbsp; Pan to Upchuck with a camera snapping a picture.
<p>The classroom again.&nbsp; Mr. Breeck pulls a sleeping Kevin's face
up by his hair, removes some googly-eyed Groucho glasses from his face,
folds them, then drops Kevin's face back on his desk.&nbsp; Pan to Daria,
Jane, and Jodie's approving glances.
<p>The Zen.&nbsp; Mystik Spiral is thrashing on stage, and Trent is singing
like his life depends on it.&nbsp; Pan to the audience where one of the
patrons is Ben, who's looking rather unimpressed.
<p>Daria is at a street corner with Tom, who is speaking.&nbsp; He stops
talking, his tongue cleaving to the roof of his mouth.&nbsp; At the exact
same instant, she acquires a cold, angry look, says something between clinched
teeth, and stalks out of the shot.
<p>The Zen.&nbsp; Ben is up on stage and apparently doing a monologue.&nbsp;
Pan to the audience, which includes Daria, Jane, and Mystik Spiral.&nbsp;
Everybody is laughing except Daria.

<br>A piece of Daria Fan Fiction By Ben Breeck
<br>Episode 1:04 of The New Teacher Series</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Scene: Lawndale High School.&nbsp; Daria and Jane are in Janet Barch's
homeroom, side by side.&nbsp; Daria is talking to Jane.
<p>Daria: That embezzlement really stuck in my craw.
<p>Jane: Daria, don't take it so personal.&nbsp; I don't think they meant
steal it.
<p>Daria: Then why didn't they give it back when I explained things to
them?
<p>Jane: I don't know.&nbsp; What reasons did they give?
<p>Daria: They said that if they sold then, the price might collapse, while
the penalties for cashing in the cds would be almost as much as the original
price.
<p>Jane: You might ask Mrs. Bennett on that.&nbsp; This smells funny.
<p>Daria: You're telling me.&nbsp; (Beat) So, Tom scored some tickets to
see the Capitol Steps, in concert at Compaq Center, this Saturday night.&nbsp;
After him and me, there are two left, in case you want to take Isaac or
Trent.
<p>Jane: I'm sorry, I can't come.&nbsp; I've been roped into decorating
for Homecoming.
<p>Daria: (shocked expression)&nbsp; Oh, God, no!&nbsp; Remember last year?<a href="#1">1</a>
<p>Jane: How could I ever forget?&nbsp; Don't worry; I'm only doing the
decorations for the dance itself this year.
<p>Daria: (sighs in relief) Whew, you scared me.
<p>(Bell Rings)
<p>Jane: Well, time to go to class.
<p>Daria: See you in Mrs. Bennett's?
<p>Jane: Same as always.
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: Mr. Breeck's Room.&nbsp; Mr. Breeck is standing in front of the
class, lecturing.
<p>Ben: Reading the Gospels, I find them to be most absurd from any standpoint,
but so as not get in too much hot water with the religious right in this
town, I'll stick with their historicity.&nbsp; Josephus Flavius, who chronicled
every one of Herod's excesses, and never rounded off numbers, never mentions
any slaughter of babies anywhere near Bethlehem.&nbsp; Not only that, but
the requirement that Joseph go to Bethlehem to register for the census
makes absolutely no sense.&nbsp; Joseph wasn't a Roman citizen.&nbsp; Joseph
wasn't even born in Bethlehem.&nbsp; If he had any close relatives there,
they were never mentioned by any of the evangelists.&nbsp; To put the Christmas
story into the synoptic Gospels and then insist that they be taken as serious
history is tantamount to including the cherry tree story in a serious biography
of George Washington.&nbsp; Yes, Brittany?
<p>Pan to Brittany.
<p>Brittany:&nbsp; You mean George Washingmachine did cut down those trees?&nbsp;
Then Johnny Appleseed must have been the one to replace them.&nbsp; Wait
a minute, aren't you engaging in, what is it? Ambiguity? Doublespeak?
<p>Pan to Daria and Jane.
<p>Daria: Gee, I think Mr. O'Neill might have gotten through to her, for
maybe ten whole seconds on Orwell.
<p>Jane: That must be a record.&nbsp; It's a good thing Mom and Dad are
Unitarians.&nbsp; We have even less in the way of concrete doctrine than
Anglicans and Northern Baptists.
<p>Daria: Well, I can top that one easily.&nbsp; We're Jewish.<a href="#2">2</a>&nbsp;
Or, at least, Dad's nominally a Reform Jew, and Mom converted when she
married Dad.
<p>Jane: That explains the candelabra Tom and I saw in your front window
when we were caroling last December.
<p>Daria: So, any ideas on a homecoming theme yet?
<p>Jane: (Smiling Evilly) I think I have something.&nbsp; By the way, while
I'm stuck here Saturday, I can swing Friday evening.&nbsp; Wanna see <i>Bedazzled</i>?
<p>Daria: Already did. It was okay, but nothing I'd see twice.&nbsp; How
about <i>Little Nicky</i>?
<p>Jane: Sure.&nbsp; Bring Tom.&nbsp; I'll bring Isaac.
<p>Daria: Okay. (Beat, faces forward) The most scholarly interpretation
of the first beast of the revelation of John of Patmos is Domitian, who
was supposed to be the reincarnation of Nero, whose Greek name, Neron Caesar,
written in Hebrew letters is equal to six hundred and sixty-six if you
write the C as a Gamma as a Gimmel and write out A as Alpha as Aleph.&nbsp;
Apparently John of Patmos didn't think highly of Domitian, who in addition
to his ruthless persecution of Christians, was one of only three emperors
in the First Century to insist on a personal cult while still alive.&nbsp;
The other two were Nero and Caligula.<a href="#3">3</a>
<p>Cut to Mr. Breeck's stunned expression.
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: Quinn's room.&nbsp; Quinn is on her bed, paging through a copy
of <i>Waif</i>.&nbsp; Phone rings.&nbsp; Quinn picks it up.
<p>Quinn: Hello?
<p>Split screen between Quinn's room and Jeffy's room.
<p>Jeffy: Quinn, that was a rather low thing to do!
<p>Quinn: (Eyes Narrowing) Jeffy? What are you talking about?
<p>Jeffy: Smearing Sandi's name like that.
<p>Quinn: But it's true-
<p>Jeffy: (interrupting) No it's not, and you know it!&nbsp; Sandi doesn't
have herpes, the clap, or the handshake either!&nbsp; How could you go
so low?
<p>Quinn: (Jaws Dropping) What?&nbsp; Where'd you get this?
<p>Jeffy: (Harshly) As if I'll tell you.&nbsp; Joey and Jamie can have
you. (Hangs up)
<p>Full Screen of Quinn as she hangs up.&nbsp; She has this numb, hangdog
expression.&nbsp; This twists itself into an expression of pure hatred.&nbsp;
She picks up the phone, then stops.
<p>Quinn: (Thought Voice Over) No, Daria is right.&nbsp; I want Sandi happy
and dumb.&nbsp; She won't know what hit her.
<p>Quinn punches some buttons on her phone and puts the receiver to her
ear.
<p>Quinn:&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; You know who I am.&nbsp; Listen, I'm calling
in my marker.&nbsp; Here's what you're going to do.&nbsp; Oh, and if you
tell anyone, I'll point the guys with the tin stars on their suits your
way...
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: Cranberry Commons.&nbsp; Daria, Tom, Jane, and Isaac are walking
out of the movie theater.
<p>Daria: I must say I was impressed.&nbsp; I even cracked a smile three
times.
<p>Jane: I must say, Rodney Dangerfield was great as the Devil.
<p>Tom: So, basically, Ncky saves hell by being unworthy of the place.
<p>Isaac: That guy must've been reading a lot of Moorcock when he was writing
it.
<p>Daria: I think he should have paid a little more attention to the classics;
<i>The
Screwtape Letters</i>, <i>The Devil and Tom Walker</i>, and <i>War in Hell
</i>and
its sequels.
<p>Tom: Perhaps.
<p>Party comes out the doors into the parking lot.
<p>Tom:&nbsp; Where did I park that rustbucket?
<p>Isaac: Right next to my Renault Alliance.
<p>Jane: (Pointing Off Screen) Hey, it's Mr. Breeck.&nbsp; And somebody's
with him.
<p>Pan to a dirty tan 1979 Jeep Cherokee.&nbsp; Ben and Link (From <i>Is
It Fall Yet</i>) are getting out.&nbsp; Pan back to Daria, Tom, Jane, and
Isaac.&nbsp; Daria and Jane have mouths hanging open in shock.
<p>Daria: Link? Is that you?
<p>Jane: Didn't you tell me about him, Daria?
<p>Daria: Yeah.
<p>Pan to Ben and Link walking up to the Mall.
<p>Ben: Daria, Jane, fancy meeting you here.
<p>Pan back to Daria, Tom, Jane, and Isaac.
<p>Daria: Link, why are you going into the theater with that strange man?&nbsp;
He could be some psycho out of a slasher movie.
<p>Cut to Ben and Link.
<p>Link: (With a hard, smirking smile similar but not identical to the
Mona Lisa smile) That's right, Uncle Ben is quite crazy.&nbsp; That's why
he's taking me to see <i>The Cell</i>.
<p>Cut back to Daria, Tom, Jane, and Isaac.
<p>Jane: Uncle Ben?
<p>Isaac:&nbsp; Yo, Ben, how's it going?
<p>Daria: (To Isaac) You know him too?
<p>Cut to Ben and Link:
<p>Ben: (indicating Link) Actually, we're second cousins once removed.&nbsp;
His mother is my Cousin Erin, the eldest daughter of my Aunt Dottie on
my father's side.<a href="#4">4</a>
<p>Link: He's the only one in my family I can really tolerate.<a href="#5">5</a>
<p>Ben: (To Isaac) Last I heard of you, you, my brother, Ellen, and Brian
were in Iowa City laying tile.&nbsp; What happened?
<p>Cut to Daria, Tom, Jane, and Isaac.
<p>Isaac: Well, we went our separate ways.&nbsp; I think Kevin is back
in Frankfort, and Brian and Ellen moved to Minneapolis.
<p>Daria: (Though Voice Over) Both of us have cousins named Erin?&nbsp;
Is he making this up?
<p>Jane: (To Isaac) Ellen?
<p>Isaac: Kevin's girlfriend, or at least she was.
<p>Cut to Ben and Link.
<p>Ben: Well, see you Monday.
<p>Ben and Link walk into the mall.
<p>Commercial Break. Stinger: Daria, Tom, Jane, and Isaac staring.&nbsp;
Daria and Jane slackjawed.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene:&nbsp; Exterior Shot of the Morgendorffer residence.&nbsp; Cut
to interior of Daria's room.&nbsp; The sun is shining and birds are chirping.
in the background as Daria, in her bed, opens her eyes, throws off her
covers, and reaches for her glasses.
<p>Daria: (Thought Voice Over)&nbsp; Today, I take a little more charge
of my life.
<p>Montage.&nbsp; Music: (<i>It All Just Happens to Hit) Right Down The
Line</i> by the Offspring.&nbsp; During thought voice overs, dim the music
a little.
<p>Daria goes over to her drawers, grabs a pair of bulletins, panties,
and a shirt.
<p>The hallway.&nbsp; Daria walks over to the bathroom door, opens it,
and enters.&nbsp; Sounds of a bathtub filling, and Daria whistling some
random melody.&nbsp; Sounds of splashing.&nbsp; Sounds of water being let
out of the tub.&nbsp; Sounds of a sink running.&nbsp; Sounds of teeth being
brushed.&nbsp; Door opens.&nbsp; Daria is wearing her usual T-shirt, as
well as the jeans from <i>Road Worrier</i>.
<p>Daria: (Thought Voice Over) Now, where is that phone book?
<p>Front Hall.&nbsp; Medium shot of Daria looking in the drawer of the
table the living room floor phone usually rests on.
<p>Daria: (Thought Voice Over) There you are. (Picks up phone book and
closes the drawer) Now it had better be in the white pages.
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: Daria's Room.&nbsp; Daria is flipping through the phone book.&nbsp;
She stops.
<p>Daria: (Thought Voice Over)&nbsp; Here it is. (Grabs her phone, punches
a few buttons and puts the phone to her ear.)
<p>Marianne: (Off Screen) Hello.&nbsp; Vitale, Davis, Horowitz, Riorden,
Schrecter, Schrecter and Schrecter.<a href="#6">6</a>
<p>Daria:&nbsp; (Out Loud) Marianne, could you please get me Eric.
<p>Marianne: (Off Screen) Daria, why don't you talk to your mom first?
<p>Daria: (in that voice usually used in Hollywood to indicate Demonic
Possession) Get Him!
<p>Pause for a few seconds.&nbsp; Split screen between Eric's office and
Daria's Room.
<p>Eric: This is Eric Schrecter speaking.
<p>Daria: Eric, Do you know what needs to be done to divorce one's parents
in Texas?
<p>Eric: I don't do Divorce or Child Emancipation so I don't know.&nbsp;
You might try my brother Horace.
<p>Daria: I see.
<p>Eric: And one other thing, Daria...
<p>Daria: (Interrupting) How do you know my name?
<p>Eric: We met last spring, at that mental health spa.&nbsp; It was rather
brief.<a href="#7">7</a>
<p>Daria: Were you the one in the checked blue suit?
<p>Eric: That was me.&nbsp; Daria, what is going on?&nbsp; You know I'm
going to tell your mother about this call on Monday.
<p>Daria: Fine with me.&nbsp; Now, get me Horace.
<p>Eric: (Sighing) Okay.
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: A rather large stadium.&nbsp; Pan down to the floor, where chairs
are laid out in rows in front of a makeshift stage.&nbsp; Four rows back
from said stage are Daria and Tom.&nbsp; Zoom in to them. (Background Music:
<i>SuperfranticUnproductiveNothingLegislation</i>
by the Capitol Steps)&nbsp; Daria is wearing the Mona Lisa smile.
<p>Daria: I always liked that song.
<p>Tom: I preferred <i>The Berries Never Fall Far From the Bush</i> myself.&nbsp;
So, how was that call to your mom's work?
<p>Daria: Basically, I could only divorce them if I had an independent
source of income and/or I could I could prove criminal abuse or neglect
to the satisfaction of both state Supreme Courts. (Sigh) Looks like you
were right.
<p>Tom: Oh well.&nbsp; At least it was done in ignorance.
<p>Daria: We'll never know, will we?
<p>End Song.&nbsp; Pan up on stage as <i>Kosovo</i> (To the tune of <i>Kokomo</i>
by the Beach Boys) begins.&nbsp; Pan back to Daria and Tom.
<p>Tom: Daria, I'm worried.
<p>Daria: What about?
<p>Tom: We go to movies, we go to restaurants.&nbsp; We even go see and
hear Mystik Spiral when they have a gig.&nbsp; But we don't really talk.
<p>Daria: What do you mean?&nbsp; We talk plenty.
<p>Tom: But it's all about our problems.&nbsp; We never talk about, well,
the world we live in, or life in general any more.<a href="#8">8</a>
<p>Daria: I never knew you were such a Depeche Mode fan, Tom.
<p>Tom: (chuckling) Yeah, that's more the sort of thing&nbsp; I wish we
would talk about.
<p>Daria: (sighing) Tom...
<p>Cut To:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Split screen between the Casa Lane and Isaac's apartment.&nbsp; Jane
and Isaac are talking on the phone..
<p>Jane: Your kidding.&nbsp; You really get dried red peppers sent to you
every other week?
<p>Isaac: Yep.&nbsp; My sister Shannon grows them.
<p>Jane: She's in Arizona, isn't she?
<p>Isaac: Yeah, right now.
<p>Jane: I realize you might be a little over age, but would you like to
see my homecoming decorations next Friday?
<p>Isaac: Sorry, I can't.&nbsp; I swung last night by switching for someone.&nbsp;
He'll be rather mad if I don't keep up my end of the bargain.
<p>Jane: Damn.
<p>Isaac: Promise me this, then.
<p>Jane: Shoot.
<p>Isaac: I want as many pictures of it as possible.
<p>Jane Sure thing.
<p>Commercial Break&nbsp; Stinger: Daria Calling Her Mother's Law Firm.
<p><b><tt>Commercial:</tt></b>
<p><b><tt>Voice Over: On the Next Episode of The New Teacher Series, Kevin
is having a little trouble in school.</tt></b>
<p><b><tt>Scene: Doug Thompson is at Mr. Breeck's mobile home front door,
looking furious.&nbsp; Cut to Mr. Breeck in the doorway.</tt></b>
<p><b><tt>Ben: (Cold, Angry) As things stand, Mr. Thompson, Kevin will
not be able to play this homecoming.&nbsp; If you want him to have some
chance at extra credit, that's one thing, but I will not be intimidated
into awarding a passing grade without merit by anyone.&nbsp; (Assuming
a feral grin) And I do suggest you leave my property right now.</tt></b>
<p><b><tt>Voice Over: And he's not the only one.</tt></b>
<p><b><tt>Scene: A dance at the Lawndale High gym.&nbsp; Upchuck has a
camera in his hand and a smile on his face.</tt></b>
<p><b><tt>Upchuck: (Thought Voice Over) Nobody sends the Chuckster to Detention
three straight times and gets away with it, Mr. Breeck.</tt></b>
<p><b><tt>Voice Over: All this and more, next week!</tt></b>
<p><b><tt>End Commercial</tt></b>
<p>Scene: Lawndale High, the hallway.&nbsp; Quinn and Stacy are walking
along.
<p>Stacy: Quinn, does this mean that Sandi <i>doesn't</i> have those horrible
DVDs?
<p>Quinn: When I was at Sandi's two years ago, she only had a VCR, so how
would I know?<a href="#9">9</a>&nbsp; But if you mean VDs, I'd say the
answer is no, if we ever get an answer.
<p>Stacy: But if you didn't start the rumor, who did?
<p>Quinn: Who did you hear it from.
<p>Stacy: Lots of people, but the one I first heard if from, and who said
she heard it from you, was Brooke.
<p>Quinn: Brooke? Why would she do that?
<p>Stacy: She might have given up on joining the Fashion Club, and decided
to permanently poison the whales.
<p>Quinn: You mean poison the wells?
<p>Stacy: (as she is saying this line, Quinn turns her head and points.)
Yeah, that.
<p>Quinn: Or maybe not.
<p>Stacy looks in Quinn's direction.&nbsp; Pan across the hallway, where
Sandi, Tiffany, Brooke, and one of the Cheerleaders shown in <i>The "F"
Word</i> are looking in Quinn and Sandi's Direction.
<p>Sandi: Gee, looks like Quinn doesn't have a date to Homecoming, because
she was so backbiting.
<p>Tiffany: Yeah.&nbsp; How low can you get?
<p>Sandi: If you want, Stacy, you can rejoin the Fashion Club.&nbsp; I
won't even make you dress me personally when one of us comes over to the
other.
<p>Pan to Quinn and Stacy
<p>Stacy: No way, Sandi!
<p>Quinn: (Yawning) Sticks and stones, Sandi, sticks and stones.
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: Mr. Breeck's Classroom.&nbsp; Ben is lecturing.
<p>Ben:&nbsp; Chin Shihuangdi was only 53 years old when he croaked.&nbsp;
If he had spent more time building infrastructure and less time trying
to find an immortality elixir, he might have left behind that "Ten-thousand
year" dynasty.&nbsp; Instead, he left behind nothing, and the Han Dynasty
seized power.
<p>Pan to Daria and Jane.
<p>Daria: Jane.
<p>Jane: Yes, Daria?
<p>Daria: I'm getting worried about Tom.
<p>Jane: You haven't gotten in to any fights with him, have you?
<p>Daria: No, nothing like that. (beat) It's just, he says he misses the
kinds of conversations we used to have before we were an item.
<p>Jane: You do still talk, don't you?
<p>Daria: Of course we do.
<p>Jane: I don't think it's too serious, but I'd still be a little concerned.
<p>Daria: Thank you, Jane.
<p>Pan to Mr. Breeck.
<p>Mr. Breeck: The Emperor who extended Han Rule the farthest was Han Wu-D....
(beat) Kevin? Kevin?
<p>Walks up to Kevin's Desk, where he is asleep.&nbsp; Ben grabs Kevin's
head by the hair, pulls off a pair of googly eyed Groucho glasses from
his face, folds them into his shirt pocket.
<p>Ben: (under his breath) I always wanted a pair of these.
<p>Ben drops Kevin's head back onto his desk.&nbsp; Kevin still doesn't
stir.
<p>Ben: Well, now. I guess Kevin gets a zero to day in participation.
<p>Pan to Daria, Jane and Jodie's approving glances.
<p>Jodie: Now there's something you don't see every day.
<p>Daria looks at Jodie with a suspicious expression.<a href="#10">10</a>
<p>Cut to:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Scene: Just in front of the Morgendorffer residence.&nbsp; Daria slams
shut the door of Tom's Ford Granada.&nbsp; Maintain the shot on her as
she walks up to the front door, opens it, and enters.
<p>Cut to the front hall.&nbsp; Daria is walking over to the staircase.
<p>Helen: (Off Screen) Just what do you think you're doing, young lady?
<p>Daria whirls around with a look of cold fury.&nbsp; Cut to Helen and
Jake.&nbsp; Helen's face has (self) righteous indignation on it.&nbsp;
Jake simply looks frazzled.
<p>Helen: You want to <i>divorce <b>us</b></i>?!?&nbsp; After all our struggles
to put a roof over your head, food on the table, and clothes on your back?
<p>Jake: (Nervously, to Helen) Uh, Darling, I think...
<p>Helen: (To Jake) Not Now Jake. (To Daria) As I was saying, Daria, I
was never so shocked or so angry in all my life as when I got that news
from Marianne, Horace, and Eric.&nbsp; Maybe we should put you up for adoption,
and leave you only the bills in our will.&nbsp; Then perhaps you will see
what good parents we really are.
<p>Pan to put Daria in the shot.
<p>Daria: (Through clinched teeth) Maybe I might get a mother who takes
time out to do things with her daughter.&nbsp; One who takes an active
interest in her likes, and her studies, as opposed to an interest that
she have likes and studies.
<p>Helen: Daria, I spent six hours in labor for you.&nbsp; I was at your
Hanukkah pageant when you were eight years old, despite the fact that I
didn't and still don't understand Hebrew.
<p>Daria: You also cleaned out my Montana Cabin Fund, not because you thought
I couldn't handle it, but in order to sink it into something called Pinkmonkey.com!&nbsp;
Do you still have some grass stashed over from your wild days with Coyote
and Willow Yeager?<a href="#11">11</a>&nbsp; Did Beavis and Butthead leave
some of their premium paint thinner at our old house and you stumble across
it when we were moving?
<p>Jake: But I read in <i>Startup Spectator</i> that Pinkmonkey.com would
experience a meteoric rise in stock performance!
<p>Daria: Yeah, it's called a pump-and-dump.&nbsp; As far as I can tell,
Pinkmonkey.com is just trying to sell <i>Cliff's Notes</i>, and Scantron
test sheets over the Internet and failing miserably.&nbsp; The number of
dot.com success stories out there is so low I can count it on one hand.&nbsp;
You'd have better luck getting all six numbers and the Power Ball with
a little help from a Ouija board.
<p>Helen: (Smacks the wall) That's it, Daria!&nbsp; Go to your room and
don't come out until I call you!
<p>Cut to Daria stomping up the stairs.&nbsp; Cut to Helen's face slowly
becoming an expression of tiredness, then suddenly, despair.
<p>Helen: Oh, my God, what have I done?
<p>Cut to a wider shot of Helen and Jake.
<p>Jake: Looks like you and Daria had a real to do to me.&nbsp; The only
things missing were 'I hate you,' and cuss words.
<p>Helen: Jake, I'm serious.&nbsp; I acted like a baby just now.&nbsp;
Daria was more mature.&nbsp; Even in family court, I would've been held
in contempt. (Frantically) Oh God, I'm becoming my mother!
<p>Jake: Nonsense. You're not becoming your mother yet.
<p>Helen: (Inquisitively) How do you know this, Jake?
<p>Jake: (Smiling) Honey, when you start referring to me in the third person
as "that kike," then you're becoming your mother.&nbsp; Not before.<a href="#12">12</a>
<p>Helen: (Smiling as well) I love you, Jake. (Embraces Jake)
<p>Cut to:
<p>Daria's Room.&nbsp; Daria clicks the remote.
<p><i>Sick Sad World</i> Announcer: (With a fake Scottish Burr) They're
Creepy and they're Kooky, Mysterious and Icky. (Regular Tone) The Entire
Grisly Clan McAddams, Next on <i>Sick Sad World</i>!
<p>Knock at the door.
<p>Daria: Go away, Mom.
<p>Quinn: (Off Screen) It's not Mom, Daria.&nbsp; Can I still come in?
<p>Daria: What for?
<p>Quinn: (Off Screen) Daria, I'm worried.
<p>Daria: Is this about trying to give me a makeover?
<p>Quinn: (Off Screen) Never.
<p>Daria: Okay, Quinn, you can come in.
<p>Pan to the door, which opens. Quinn enters and walks over to Daria's
desk, grabs a chair, swings it over to Daria's bed, and sits in it.
<p>Daria: What's this about, Quinn?
<p>Quinn: What was all that yelling about, Daria?
<p>Daria: I'm not sure it is any of your business.
<p>Quinn: It interrupted my phone conversation, Daria.&nbsp; It is my business.&nbsp;
You didn't get into real trouble, did you?
<p>Daria: Ok, I'll tell you.&nbsp; They found, confiscated, and squandered
a bank account which I had specifically set aside.&nbsp; Then Mom flew
off the handle when I actually complained.
<p>Quinn: What?&nbsp; There's got to be more to it than you're saying.
<p>Daria: There is. (Takes a breath.) But right now is not the time to
give an unabridged account.
<p>Quinn: When would it be then, Daria?
<p>Daria: Maybe in about five years, if then. Oh, and Quinn.
<p>Quinn: Yes Daria?
<p>Daria: You've been acting rather strange toward Sandi lately.&nbsp;
You aren't trying to be friendly, but at the same time, you aren't starting
cat fights or even acting like you even know her either.
<p>Quinn: Remember that rumor going around about Sandi having those horrible
diseases?
<p>Daria: Yeah, so?
<p>Quinn: Well, I didn't start it.&nbsp; I didn't even hear about it until
today.&nbsp; But everyone says I started it, and I lost a member of my
fan club for supossedly starting it.
<p>Daria: I see.
<p>Quinn: (Evil Grin) Thing is, why should there be rumors going around
when the truth can be almost as damning?
<p>Daria: I think I know where this is going.&nbsp; For your sake and mine,
I don't want to know any more.
<p>Quinn: (Shrugging) Suit yourself.
<p>Daria: One thing though, Quinn.
<p>Quinn: What else?
<p>Daria: Could you help me with what to wear to Homecoming?&nbsp; I might
as well wring out as much enjoyment from this event as I possibly can,
as I don't think I will be getting much from anywhere else.
<p>Quinn: (Grinning from ear to ear) Daria! I thought this wasn't about
any sort of makeover.
<p>Daria: (Mona Lisa Smile)
