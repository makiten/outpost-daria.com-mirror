<h1><span class=postbody><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>To Mother a
Morgendorffer</span></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>Synopsis: </u></b>The issue of Daria&#8217;s maternal
lineage is finally answered, in rather silly fashion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody><span lang=EN-AU>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>The events of the last week had
rendered Daria Morgendorffer speechless. Through several unsubtle clues, her
very identity had been called into question. The years of parental badgering,
the sisterly torment of Quinn, all appeared a falsehood, her very life seemed
to be founded upon a lie. Having finally embraced her position, Daria
reluctantly prepared for its disappearance. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>It had all begun with the 'voluntary' blood test held at
school. Conducted to detect possible donors, (It was rumoured Ms Li needed a
top-up for her supplies) the result had been shocking. <b>B</b>.&nbsp; Neither
Jake nor Helen shared this type, suggesting either a hidden surrogate past, or
unknown parents. Only Daria's trembling body revealed her cathartic state, one
she was finding difficult to escape.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>Ever perceptive, Jane soon noticed
something was wrong. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>&quot;So Daria, you always felt like you were never a part
of your family&quot; she had joked. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>&quot;Jane, this is serious. I could have a whole new
family to favour my siblings. At least Mom and Dad tried to be caring
parents&quot; Daria abruptly responded. This was no time for jokes. Somewhere
in the distance, a lonely organ played into the starry night. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>However, this was not the end of the Lawndale health
regime and its revelations. She soon submitted to a compulsory DNA test.
(&#8220;For uh, safekeeping&#8217;, Ms. Li had announced.) The results were
more positive, showing Barksdale traces. Perhaps Helen had had that affair. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody><i>&nbsp;</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody><i>Probably not, </i></span><span
class=postbody>Daria reflected. The doubt remained. All she knew was that her
connection with the Morgendorffer line was severed. While not sharing genetic
material with the notorious Mad Dog Morgendorffer was not entirely a curse,
neither was it a blessing. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Somehow, Daria endured another day of school life with
stoicism. The idiocy, the conformity, all passed before her in a hellish blur.
She survived only out of experience. Few saw through her fa&ccedil;ade.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>Trudging home that day, Daria saw two
unusual sights. Firstly, her mother Helen was home. Secondly, and more
unusually, she was conversing with an individual who was most definitely not
Eric. (His name being unmentioned was a dead giveaway.) Despite this, she
appeared immersed and unaware of Daria&#8217;s presence. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>&quot;She has to know now, she&#8217;s almost eighteen
years old! How long can we continue the charade?&quot; </span><br>
<br>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria looked on anxiously, observing Helen&#8217;s focused
nods and expressive gestures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<span class=postbody>&quot;Yes, I'll see you then. Goodbye Amy.&quot; </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Daria had overheard it all. &quot;Mom? What&#8217;s
happening?&quot; Daria asked. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Surprised by hearing Daria&#8217;s voice without its
familiar monotone, Helen turned; &quot;Oh, hello sweety. Your...Aunt Amy is
coming tonight. Daria, we have to talk.&quot; </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>&quot;Oh good. Is this where I discover I really do come
from another planet?&quot; Daria responded, her cynicism on autopilot. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>&#8220;Oh Daria.&#8221; Helen sobbed.
Allwould soon be revealed. </span><br>
<span class=postbody><b><u>&nbsp;</u></b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>Within an hour, Aunt Amy arrived in her
usual fashion. Her mood too resembled Daria&#8217;s, focusing on the matter at
hand and choosing not to exercise her pithy wit. The near-silence of her close
relatives worried Helen. Meanwhile, </span>Daria sat anxiously on the lounge. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>Nervously, painfully, Helen began; </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>&quot;Daria, listen. We have something shocking to tell
you... I'm not your mother.&quot; </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Suddenly, Daria comprehended. The hints had been obvious,
in retrospect. The blood test, Amy's mysteriously sudden visit, the expository
dialogue of the last hour. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>&quot;I must be Amy's
daughter&#8230;&quot; she thought. &quot;It all makes sense. It could be
worse.&quot; </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Impulsively, almost enthusiastically (Given the
situation), she blurted &quot;Amy is my mother?&quot; </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Based upon the evidence, is was clearly the most logical
conclusion, founded upon precedent and similarity in appearance, manner and
intelligence. Further, many people had noticed Amy and Daria&#8217;s
similarity. Perhaps they were not so misguided after all, operating on the
basis of strong evidence. Sadly, life rarely does make sense. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>Mysteriously, that organ again began to
play. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>&quot;No Daria&quot; Jake uttered, &quot;Your real mother
is....Your Aunt, I mean Mother Rita!&quot; </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The look of sheer horror was obvious to almost all.
Obliviously, Jake continued; &quot;This is great, a weight off our shoulders. I
don&#8217;t know how I managed to keep that secret for seventeen years!
Seriously though, we're sure you'll love being Rita's daughter.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>&#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t have announced
it otherwise&#8221; Helen added.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>&#8220;Like mother like daughter!&quot;
Jake boorishly concluded. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>&quot;But where is she?&quot; Daria enquired. &#8221;Where
is my mother?&#8221; </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>&quot;Oh, she&#8217;s off being Mother's favourite again
with her 937th boyfriend in tow. Or was that 942<sup>nd</sup>?&quot; scornfully
responded Helen. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Looking around the room that now seemed so unfamiliar,
Daria grew yet more confused. It had all seemed to make sense. A thought arose.
<i>If Amy wasn't her mother, why had she suddenly turned up for the occasion? </i></span><i><br>
</i><br>
<span class=postbody>&quot;Amy--why?&quot; Daria tearfully asked. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>&quot;I came to give moral support to my favourite niece.
I&#8217;m sorry.&quot; Amy answered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. You
didn&#8217;t have anything to do with it&#8221; Daria responded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>&#8220;I know, but you&#8217;re still
my favourite niece.&#8221;, said Amy, giving Daria a small squeeze. Quinn
ignored the gesture.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>Sadly, Amy&#8217;s concern did little
for Daria, caught amidst the collapsing foundations of her life. It was all too
much. Despite her aunt's support, Daria collapsed to the floor. Quinn appeared
almost triumphant, cut short by glares from Helen and Amy. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>The silence was soon broken by Jake, speaking with his
usual lack of concern. He spoke loudly enough to awaken Daria, still trying
vainly to come to terms.</span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>&quot;Wow Daria, what a shock! Now I know your mother
couldn&#8217;t be here, but just wait until you see the father! I'll cue the
music.&quot; </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Just then, Charles Ruttheimer II entered the room,
accompanied by the smooth sensual sounds of Barry White.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>&#8220;Daria, baby!&#8221; he implored.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>That moment, the organ music could no
longer be heard. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>Daria Morgendorffer&#8217;s piercing
scream was heard all throughout Lawndale. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>&nbsp;</span></p>
