<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Daria's conscience gets the better of her, she
finds herself on a fashion rollercoaster ride through hell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Gee Daria, it's Friday already. I'm surprised Ms. Li
hasn't made the Asian Educator formal dance mandatory yet. There are only a
couple weeks to go.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't jinx it Lane, I'm not going formal for any..." At
that moment, the school's PA tones chimed loudly, cutting Daria off in
mid-sentence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Attention students of Lawndale High...the Asian Educator
formal dance is now mandatory.&nbsp; Show your support for this outstanding organization
by picking up your nominally priced tickets at the school's office before
classes end Friday...or face a full letter grade loss in all classes." Ms. Li
quickly added,&nbsp; "Stag, is acceptable people, just be there. That is all. Good
day."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn it Jane, it's like she read your mind.&nbsp; Daria anticipated
Jane's next question and rushed to address it. "Don't ask if my mother can stop
her either. &nbsp;Mom already made her position clear this morning. She wants me to
attend as an extra curricular activity." Daria let out a long sigh, "I wouldn't
be surprised Mom hadn't called to suggest it to Ms. Li."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Daria and Jane exchanged books at their lockers in
uneasy silence, the fashion club passed by with a fellow student in tow, known
only as 'Guy'.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sandy spoke in a haughty tone, "We simply cannot allow
a guy into the Fashion Club, it would violate our by-laws,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stacy spoke up, "No guy could possibly understand 'true'
fashion anyway."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Besides," droned Tiffany, "it's just so wrong..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I agree, now go away Guy," said Quinn. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After they passed, Jane looked to Daria saying, "Oh
look, The Fascist Club just crushed the dreams of another poor tragic soul.
They have heartlessly ground another fragile human spirit beneath the wheels of
senseless oppression.&nbsp; I have junk food, let's go hang out on the roof."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Junk food; oh yeah, I'm in. I always have time for processed
sugar and empty calories," said Daria with unusual enthusiasm.&nbsp; You have any of
those Swedish fish?" &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Daria and Jane arrived at the roof, they found it occupied.&nbsp;
The young man known as Guy was there, sobbing softly into his hands.&nbsp; Jane's
face wrinkled into a mask of disapproval. She stopped just short of leaving the
narrow access way.&nbsp; She began to turn in retreat but Daria intervened. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria softly said, "It is against my better judgment,
but I feel strangely responsible."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're getting soft in your old age Amiga, but maybe
you're right," said Jane. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As they approached, Guy stiffened, then began to dry
his face with the sleeve of his shirt before looking up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria stood before the young man for a moment before
speaking.&nbsp; She spoke, with gentleness. "The fashion club is rough on everyone.&nbsp;
Try not to let them get to you...er ah um...Guy."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Terry.&nbsp; My name is Terry, not Guy.&nbsp; Terry McGillum. Thank
you though for being kind though, I appreciate it. I guess shouldn't wear my
heart on my sleeve, not with that crowd."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not when it comes to the fashion club, no," affirmed
Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After an uneasy silence, Daria said, "Well then, I'm
glad we've gotten that out of the way."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane quickly nodded saying, Yes, we must go, ah...good
luck and all."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the girls turned to go Terry spoke in a subdued
voice.&nbsp; "I asked to join the fashion club you know."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria and Jane stopped in their tracks.&nbsp; After a few
moments, Jane turned and spoke.&nbsp; "Why? Why would you want to?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry dropped his head before speaking.&nbsp; "I love
fashion, I always have.&nbsp; As a child I watched old movies with an insatiable
sense of awe. The gowns, the costumes, the style, it took my breath away. I became
so enthralled, I begged my mom teach me how to sew when I was just a child.&nbsp; Since
then I've even been taking sewing classes, some even at the college. I had
hoped the fashion club would want to see my work.&nbsp; Secretly, I desperately wanted
to see my clothing out in the light of day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a pair of slacks I need hemmed," murmured Jane uncomfortably.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry slowly looked up.&nbsp; "I can hem your slacks.&nbsp; I can
'make' a pair of slacks.&nbsp; I can make a pair of slacks along with a matching suit.
I can do the blouse and underwear to go along with the suit too.&nbsp; That, was
what I was doing with the fashion club today.&nbsp; If they had let me join, I would
have happily offered to make their gowns for the upcoming Asian Educator
formal. Forgive the boast, but I would have made each of the club members a gown
which would've made them breathtaking in their beauty."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah well, I'm sorry it didn't work out, Guy, I mean...Terry,
but we must be going now," Daria said nervously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane suddenly placed her books on the roof, then to
Daria's surprise, sat on them while looking deep into Terry's eyes. "I want to
see your work, today, after school. Can you arrange it?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry looked up with a slight smile crossing his lips.&nbsp;
"Yes, I sure can. When and where?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tonight at seven, at my house, I'll write down the
directions. But first, what is it that you aren't telling us young man?&nbsp; There
is more here, I can feel it.&nbsp; Fess.&nbsp; Confession is good for the soul."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria beamed a withering look to Jane. &nbsp;Realizing her
friend was too caught up in the moment to stop, she followed suit with her own books,
releasing a great sigh resignation on the way down.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry watched as Daria came to rest on her great pile
of books. He eyed her legs appreciatively before lowering his head to search
his soul for the right words to answer Jane's question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Confession is good for the soul eh," Terry repeated as
his face took on a hard look, one tingeing on defiance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria felt the tension build.&nbsp; She knew something was
coming, something big. She had no doubt it would become a heavy burden on her
soul too.&nbsp; She could see no way out, nowhere to run, not now.&nbsp; She wished with
all her heart and soul they had stayed off the roof this day. She found little
satisfaction in knowing it was her original sense of responsibility which had
been the initial impetus of her being there now. Damn Quinn and her air-headed
fashion drones. Damn her own sense of compassion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry smiled then asked softly, "Have you ever heard of
The Rocky Horror Picture show?" Before they could answer, he went on,&nbsp; "There
is a line in it, "Don't dream it, be it."&nbsp; I took it to heart.&nbsp; I too want to
dress like Fay Rae."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane gently smiled, leaned forward and placed her hands
on Terry's shoulders.&nbsp; "Well said Amigo.&nbsp; Thank you for trusting us.&nbsp; Your
trust won't be abused, I promise. The bell is about to ring now. I'll see you tonight
though. &nbsp;No sooner had Jane spoken than the sound of the bell rose up to assault
their ears.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry smiled, "I'll see you tonight with my stuff, I
promise." He then turned to Daria, saying softly, "Please be there, I really want
you to see my work too."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I show first? I have formal gowns in this
bag, casual clothes in this one and power suits over here." Terry gestured to
the large garment bags, speaking with a quaver of excitement ringing in his
voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's open the bag with gowns first," Jane suggested.&nbsp;
"Let's see what the fashion club is missing out on."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria smiled at Jane's wry comment, though her eyes
bore a "deer in headlights" look. &nbsp;She always wore a frightened look when
exposed to fashion in any form. She thought seriously now about giving in to
her impulse to dash away as Terry disgorged the garment bag of its many colored
fabrics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry drew out his first gown with a flourish, holding
it up before Jane with pride.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane let out a low whisper, "Wow."&nbsp; She then up looked
to Terry, saying with awe, "this is so beautiful, I'm just blown away.&nbsp; You
really do know your stuff."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria said nothing.&nbsp; She stared at the dress, transfixed.&nbsp;
The gown was in vibrant green velvet with a gold satin cross-over waist ribbon,
which was carefully tied to the base at the gowns back. The dress had a bold open
backline, though the d&eacute;colletage in front was graced with a delicate gold lace
modesty panel.&nbsp; Terry then brought out a shoulder wrap to complete the ensemble.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry winked conspiratorially to Jane, then gracefully moved
to stand before Daria. He displayed the shimmering gown before her eyes as though
offering it to a great queen. He then slowly knelt down, draping the gown
across Daria's knees. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria was startled senseless. She stared at the gown
with great trepidation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lovely woman, you bring this gown to life, it begs to
grace your beauty," Terry assured her with wicked showmanship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't hear anything," stammered Daria uncomfortably.&nbsp;
However, she didn't set the gown aside when Terry rose and turned away. Terry's
bravado left her deeply rattled. Without thought, she stroked the rich velvet
of the gown as though it were a treasured pet.&nbsp; She was quite comfortable with
the gown so boldly spread across her naked knees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With one last smile for Daria, Terry again turned to
the garment bag, this time, drawing out a scarlet satin gown.&nbsp; He held it
against his own form, dancing in a twirl only to stop before Jane.&nbsp; He reached
out a hand, whispering softly, "Dance with us, please?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane found herself on winged feet, moving in a whirl of
red satin.&nbsp; Terry raised her hand bringing her to pirouette until the red satin
came alive against Jane's slight form. Terry danced her to a standstill before a
large mirror.&nbsp; Jane stood illuminated in the glass, the scarlet gown clinging
warmly against her.&nbsp; She closed her eyes to savor the sweet image.&nbsp; She felt
beautiful in a magic way, one she never believed possible till this wonderful moment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The smile of joy fighting to bloom across Jane's face was
what Terry needed to know.&nbsp; Emboldened, he set about displaying the rest of the
gowns, spreading each carefully across Jane's bed with deft fingers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane turned from the mirror, still holding the satin gown
against her as she gazed at the colorful new submissions.&nbsp; "So lovely," she
enthused, "so very lovely, thank you for showing us your work.&nbsp; I never
imagined clothing could have such life and vibrance. After a moment, Jane
asked, "Which is your favorite?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry's face took on a wistful look.&nbsp; "I love them all,"
he said. &nbsp;He looked at the many gowns displayed.&nbsp; "Each one was a dream to
make.&nbsp; Every moment working, was a joy.&nbsp; Of them all though, it would be a toss
up between only two.&nbsp; One is this powder-blue satin cowl-neck with matching
waist bow." He picked it up with loving hands saying,&nbsp; "I really love the way
it flares out in train at the floor. Though if I were hard pressed, I would
have to choose my second favorite." He gently laid the blue one down, then after
a final pat, he reached for a fuchsia colored silk crepe gown. "The one
shoulder design is so very pleasing to the eye. The silver bead work bodice is
a lovely accent also.&nbsp; However, the trumpet flare skirt completely takes my
breath away. Yes, this one, without doubt, is my all time favorite."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane's face took on a look of intensity. &nbsp;"Don't dream
it, be it.&nbsp; The fuchsia was made for you, put it on. &nbsp;I want to see it as it
was meant to be, not simply sprawled out across a bed."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria's eyes went wide in shock.&nbsp; Jane's sudden request
raced beyond her conservative imagination's ability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry stared at Jane for a moment, though her gaze
never wavered.&nbsp; He asked with a small voice, "Oh Jane, are you really serious?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Completely," affirmed Jane.&nbsp; "You may use Wind's room
next door to change, but this is what I want, so hurry."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry's face was a mask of confusion.&nbsp; He turned to
Daria for support.&nbsp; He looked to her imploringly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria's eyes narrowed, she didn't understand Jane's
ploy, but chose to let her run with it. Daria trusted Jane even though at the
moment, it required a great leap of faith.&nbsp; "Yes," she said firmly. &nbsp;I second
Jane.&nbsp; I want to see the gown as it was meant to be too."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry let out a long sigh.&nbsp; In truth, he had outed
himself on the roof. His fate had been in Daria and Jane's hands from that moment
on.&nbsp; For good or bad, he was beholden to them. &nbsp;He was left with no choice but
ride the approaching wave, wherever it was to take him. &nbsp;As he turned to go, he
wondered at the depth of his own stupidity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the door had closed and a count of three had
passed, Daria whispered insistently to Jane.&nbsp; "You do know what you're doing
don't you?&nbsp; I mean you do have a plan which doesn't involve irreparably
wrecking Terry's life I hope."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Relax Daria, it's just us here, what could possibly go
wrong? &nbsp;Besides, I do have a method to my madness. &nbsp;I've always wondered if the
rumors about the Mona Lisa were true. &nbsp;I think I found the perfect subject to
work with now. &nbsp;Have you looked closely at him? &nbsp;He can go either way
appearance wise. &nbsp;Just a push in one direction or another will make a huge
difference.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm happy for you; just don't forget the subject here
is a real human being. And...I'm involved too. &nbsp;I wouldn't want to think myself
as being cold and callus like my sister when it comes to screwing up people's
lives. At least not till I'm in the White House.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fear not Amiga, I have it all under control. Trust me."&nbsp;
Jane smiled reassuringly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry carried the gown to the bed in Wind's room.&nbsp; He
sat beside it, quickly becoming lost in thought.&nbsp; Yes, the gown had been made
for him.&nbsp; Yes, he had tried it on before. Up until now, he held to the excuse
that he was only testing the fit.&nbsp; Was there more to it? &nbsp;Was it drag? Or just
a curiosity.&nbsp; He was unsure, deeply unsure.&nbsp; He knew without doubt however, if
he were to put it on now, and return to Jane's room, it would be drag.&nbsp; It
would catapult him into a mindset he had not been willing to pursue thus far.
He looked around the masculine room. Terry pondered many things as he rested
there.&nbsp; Finally, he took a deep breath, exhaling slowly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria and Jane found themselves actually startled when
the tapping on the door came.&nbsp; Daria had secretly hoped Terry had run away as
she wanted so desperately to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane felt apprehension too.&nbsp; She had developed some
misgiving in the time Terry had been away.&nbsp; After loosing a soft sigh, she said
loudly enough for him to hear, "Please come in. We're waiting."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry entered the room, then stopped in the center to
strike a pose. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane said softly, "You look radiant."&nbsp; Jane rose with a
pensive look. &nbsp;She went to him, taking his hands in hers, "I was right in
asking you put this on. Thank you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria rose and walked to him. She made a slow circle while
looking at each aspect of the gown. She then smiled gently to him.&nbsp; "Well, here
we are," she said softly.&nbsp; After a moment of reflection Daria said with
surprise in her voice, "I guess clothes do make a difference.&nbsp; This is the
first time I've seen you when you didn't look lost or out of place.&nbsp; Forgive me
for saying so. I don't mean it as derogatory in anyway, it's just that...well...you
look...comfortable."&nbsp; Having blurted out her observation, she retreated to her
chair in confusion. Daria reached for the velvet gown, placing it over her
knees once again, as though it could shield her from further emotion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane watched Daria for a moment with concern before
saying softly, "Daria's right you know. I don't know why she is, but you now have
a sense of calm and poise which eludes you at school. I almost wish the fashion
club were here now to tweak you to perfection." Jane asked softly, "Would you
allow me to try though?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why? Why are you willing to do this?" implored Terry. "Is
there a reason? I mean, you have no reason to make any fantasy's of mine come
true, so why? Please, I need to know.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell him Jane, you owe him that much," stated Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want you as an art subject," Jane confessed. "The
moment you told us about your "dream," I became enthralled with the thought of
testing the Mona Lisa theory."&nbsp; After a moment Jane said, "Maybe I'm too far over
the line here, I don't know. &nbsp;Maybe this is a bad idea."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe it's my secret fantasy becoming cold hard
reality," Terry said.&nbsp; "Maybe, I was on a collision course with my own inevitable
fate.&nbsp; Maybe, you two are less involved than you imagine.&nbsp; Perhaps you both are
just casualties of my own tragic circumstance." Terry stood before them with a
sense of resignation reflected in sad eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quinn is "tragic circumstance." &nbsp;I can deal with this
little problem," Daria said with determination.&nbsp; Let's see where we all end up;
not like any of us have a choice now anyway. Besides, Sick Sad World won't be
on tonight cause of the stupid football game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry smiled, "I hate football."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"We tiny few; the "We hate Football" club. No football,
rah, cheered Jane softly. They all laughed nervously till Jane spoke. &nbsp;Now...let's
get this night underway."&nbsp; She motioned Terry to a chair before her vanity
mirror.&nbsp; "If you are still ok with this I mean."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry chuckled, saying, "In for a penny, in for a
pound. I'm already in too deep to climb out, so let's explore the murky bottom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria watched the proceedings with a mixture of horror
and curiosity. She had to admit, Jane was right in her assessment. Terry's
appearance was transformed quite easily.&nbsp; She actually felt queasy as the
transformation progressed.&nbsp; To avoid thinking of the fragile line between
genders and her own fragile social identity, she chose to join the debacle by
helping set Jane's paints and easel to readiness. After finishing, she found a
chair and watched dispassionately while Jane made a photographic essay of
Terry's new look. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry laughed nervously.&nbsp; He asked softly, "Who would
have ever thought I'd be this dressed up with no place to go?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria and Jane snickered at his words, till a new voice
rang out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That isn't quite true; we do have a place to go.&nbsp;
Janey, my car is down and Max has the tank," Trent said while leaning against
the door frame.&nbsp; I need a ride to the gig tonight over in Blouserville.&nbsp; While
you're all there, you might as well stay and hear the band.&nbsp; I'll need a ride
home after anyway. Trent entered through the open door of Jane's room, walked
to Terry and said, cool gown, looks great. I like it." Then to Jane he said,
"Maybe the gown is a bit much for The Manta Ray. I'm sure you can find
something a bit less formal though.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Manta ray? Isn't that a gay bar," Jane asked
incredulously? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes'mm it is.&nbsp; It was real hard talking Max into
making the gig, so go easy on him. Trent turned to Terry, "You'll fit in
perfectly as you are, so just relax and have fun. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jane, I have a question," Daria said, her face a study
in confusion.&nbsp; We've opened Pandora's Box for Terry. He was asked to dance
before we found a table. He appears to be having the time of his life too. But,
I was wondering about something.&nbsp; Everyone seems very out going here. It looks
like everyone is easy to get out on the dance floor. I wonder why...well, I...oh
never mind." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you asking me to dance Morgandorfer?&nbsp; Jane asked
with a wicked gleam to her eye. Ok."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "NO.&nbsp; No I wasn't.&nbsp; Oh Jane I don't think...oh god..."&nbsp;
Daria reached for her soda and took a big gulp.&nbsp; "No, what I was wondering was;
why has no one asked you out on the floor?&nbsp; You told me about Allison being
attracted and all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane burst into bright laughter. "Oh Daria, don't you
know?&nbsp; No one has asked because they think "we" are a couple." Jane patted
Daria's hand with a smile. "If you dared though, I'd be happy to cut a rug with
you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria could only stare at Jane, completely wordless.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry shattered the spell by sliding into the chair
opposite Jane. He patted the chair across from Daria, motioning the stranger he
had spent the evening dancing with to sit.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Guys, meet Albert, he is an apparel broker.&nbsp; He wants
to see my work. I'm going to present tomorrow.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I would never have
gotten this chance if you hadn't been there for me.&nbsp; I will forever be in your
debt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Albert said with a smile, "I like Terry's outfit tonight.
If the rest of the suite is as well crafted, I will have no difficulty showing
his work in places where it will get noticed. He turned to Daria, taking the
tip of her lapel between his fingers saying, "Darling, you really should trust
Terry's judgment from now on. He can help you know." He beamed a benign smile
to Daria, then tugged Terry back to the dance floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria fumed at the insult. "How could this night get
any worse," she muttered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's how," said Jane brightly as she pointed to the
crowd with merriment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Daria, Jane, I never dreamed I'd see you here, gushed Brittany.&nbsp;
"Wow, this is so cool.&nbsp; Are you two...like...into poetry like Estelle and me?" As
she spoke, an attractive brunette appeared at Brittany's side.&nbsp; "Guys, this is
Estelle, she loves my poetry.&nbsp; We met when I had to visit a college for that
stupid placement class thingie. We've been friends ever since, just like you
and Jane."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Estelle shyly nudged Brittany, indicating she wanted to
return to the dance floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See you two out on the dance floor," Brittany said
cheerily. They blended back into the crowd as quickly as they had materialized.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh joy, Brittany finding us in a gay bar, together,
was exactly what I wanted to see happen," moaned Daria. "You're right Jane,
that did take this night to rock bottom."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well Daria, being that all is lost and doom gloom and
despair have settled in, come on, I do want to dance...with you...now...please?"
Without waiting for an answer Jane pulled a reluctant Daria to the dance floor.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria was on the floor before she could lodge a
refusal. Though once there, she found a certain anonymity in the crowd.&nbsp; She
just wished Jane would stop smiling so happily.&nbsp; Daria wasn't much of a dancer,
though she was now deeply caught up in the moment.&nbsp; In all honesty, if she had
to dance, then having Jane as a partner was better than a stranger. She began
to relax, secure in the knowledge she was far from home. Brittany more than
likely would say nothing for fear of upsetting the other cheerleaders. The
night would soon be over, then she could hide in the sanctity of her room till
the horror of this night faded. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Amiga...the music tempo has changed, Daria. Pay
attention," Jane commanded gently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria looked up, Jane was right, the tempo had slowed,
so she turned to leave the floor.&nbsp; Jane took her hand, gently pulling her back to
Jane's warm embrace.&nbsp; Daria hesitated only a moment before caving in.&nbsp; After
all it was only Jane.&nbsp; Several dances later, the music tempo rose again, though
neither&nbsp; Daria nor Jane noticed as they continued to dance locked in oblivious embrace
despite the gyrations of the crowd surrounding them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brittany nudged Estelle, calling her attention to Jane
and Daria.&nbsp; Estelle smiled saying loud enough for Brittany to hear, "Aw, what a
sweet couple."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria sat in the front seat with Trent, deeply lost in her
own thoughts.&nbsp; They had stopped for a snack at an all night diner, just outside
of Blouserville. Afterward,&nbsp; Jane and Terry bid for the back seat.&nbsp; She fought
back a cynical smile, Jane was some romantic.&nbsp; A few dances then off to snore
in the back seat.&nbsp; Both Jane and Terry had quite a night though.&nbsp; She used the
vanity mirror behind the visor to look into the back seat. They were now sleeping
quietly as the long miles to Lawndale slowly played out.&nbsp; She almost wished her
thoughts would slow till the oblivion of sleep would come to her too. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trent broke Daria's reverie by saying, "You and Janey
made a cute couple tonight.&nbsp; I'm going to write a song about finding magic
where you don't expect it. It'll be a little sweet for the Spiral, but if we
use it at the end of the night, I know we can make it work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have another gig at the Manta Ray next month. Maybe you'll
get a another chance to see if the magic is still alive. Until then, I wouldn't
let myself get all worried about something that happened and wasn't planned.&nbsp;
Not till it happens again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's been quite a night," Daria said pensively. "I
wonder if everything changed, or if nothing did.&nbsp; I almost hope this was only a
dream...in some ways."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria clutched the bulky gift as she entered the front
door of the Morgandorfer home. She was greeted by a loud argument between Quinn
and Helen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But Mom, it's for the Asian Educator formal. The
fashion club has to maintain high standards," whined Quinn. "Besides, it's a
Terry McGillum exclusive one-of-a-kind gown. No one but the fashion club will
be in McGillum gown, that makes it priceless.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quinn, 500 dollars for one gown for one night is far
too much," Helen scolded.&nbsp; Designer, one-of-a kind gown or not, how can your
father afford a gown for Daria now?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Daria can stay home," Quinn said petulantly.&nbsp; Besides,
she'd just be out of place there...everywhere else for that matter."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's all right Mom, I already have a gown for the
formal." &nbsp;She patted the parcel, "right here," Daria intoned.&nbsp; Her fingers
played delicately across the knots, loosening the paper sheath.&nbsp; Daria spread
away the protective cover, then drew out the green velvet gown she had so
warmly bonded with the previous Friday.&nbsp; With a wicked gleam for Quinn, she
said with &nbsp;a smirk.&nbsp; "See, I have a gown. It too is a McGillum, a Terry
McGillum exclusive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh Daria, how can your father afford a second designer
gown," Helen asked in misery.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dad doesn't have to pay, it was a gift from Terry
McGillum himself, he is a dear friend."&nbsp; Daria grinned wickedly as she leaned
toward Quinn. She said sarcastically, "Jane has one too."&nbsp; Then with a
triumphant smile she said, "We were permitted first pick from the latest line
before it was released to market.&nbsp; See you at the formal Quinn."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Na
Na Naa Na</p>
