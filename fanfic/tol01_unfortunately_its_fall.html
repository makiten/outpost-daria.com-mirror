after nine messages from Eric Friday night and Saturday morning demanding that
Helen pick up the phone, there had one from James Vitale, the senior (and
managing) partner, sent just before Helen had arrived back from picking Daria

nerves; he did, he just had perfected the art of not showing them.&nbsp; "Let's
order something and then talk." A gesture brought a waiter in a hurry.&nbsp; Vitale
was one of a dozen or so steady customers who had to be treated with extra

her was twice what she put away for Quinn and me together.&nbsp; And don't feel too

pizzas were ready and half eaten to cover first the highlights of Jane and then
Daria's summer at Ashfield. &nbsp;It was Jodie who asked Daria, "I can see how happy
Jane is, and how proud you are, but why aren't you more, I don't know, satisfied
with the three books?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

that writing, and that writing is of course underdeveloped since I was
younger," Daria admitted.&nbsp; "I was at my worst the summer before I moved here &ndash; I
was not thrilled by Highland, in fact just about any respect Lawndale is
better. . . ." The other three shuddered at that truth. ". . . but I had carved
out a niche was that I felt I might be able to live with by the end of ninth
grade.&nbsp; Then, I got the news we were moving, but it could have been any one of
four different places, and it just dragged out for the whole summer.&nbsp; Quinn
started high school, and seemed to be determined to undermine what little peace,
or at least equilibrium, I had there.&nbsp; Then we move here, and she was instantly
a hit while I was tossed into self-esteem class.&nbsp; No offense," Daria said to
Jane. "I couldn't know it would turn out well."</span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"This overly dark and
angst-ridden writing, especially the violent revenge fantasies and poetry, helped
me deal with some issues, and gave me lots of practice writing, and of course it
helped get me into Ashfield.&nbsp; But the instructors were right: I don't want to
have to keep writing like that.&nbsp; I need to develop my writing." Daria shrugged.
"So, publishing it is good, but in the long run, it doesn't mean much."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Well, it turns out that there
are basically three types of degree programs," Daria answered. "At most
colleges, you can declare most majors going in, although a few make you wait
before declaring nearly all majors until you're a sophomore." Jodie and Mack
nodded. &quot;In any case, most schools have at least a few majors which can't
be declared going in, usually some program where you need a certain GPA or need
to pass certain prerequisites with minimum grades before being admitted." The
two looked interested; they had not run into that before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"But a few majors work
differently &ndash; for example, most of the best art, music, and creative writing
programs require you to apply to them as well as to the university &ndash; getting
into the university doesn't mean you can get into the program, it's more the
other way around.&nbsp; You have to send in portfolios for art or creative writing,
or audition for music.&nbsp; If you are accepted by the program and meet the
university's minimum requirements, you're in."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Once, why?&nbsp; You were there,
after all," Daria asked, puzzled. "Well, I did take some of the achievement
tests last fall." Jane and Mack looked a little puzzled by that, but Jodie knew
many of the elite schools required two or three of the subject tests, usually
including writing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

know how Daria had done of the subject exams; it would likely depress her,
although she had scored well enough herself.&nbsp; "I hope I got the fourteen-twenty
Crestmore requires this time," she went on. "I don't want to take that exam
again!"&nbsp; Seeing the unasked question, she replied, "Thirteen-sixty the first

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

where else you want as well as Crestmore, and try selling your Dad on going to
Crestmore for your MBA instead.&nbsp; Much better revenge, and a lot of schools

promise anything, other than a scout looking you over, but both men earned
their undergrad degrees where they teach now and seemed oddly attached to their

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>"And now you probably
know John's parents run Pizza Prince and the family owns at least three other
pizza places and Mario's over in Oakwood, and probably that they are in the
school orchestra," Quinn pointed out, figuring those would be the main quick
selling points Mack would come up with.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>"Did it ever occur to
you that they, especially Theo, eggs Kevin on for much the same reason you
sometimes egged those mutants on back in Highland?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>"I have to say 'no'
to that, although Mack did mention it," Daria admitted. "It's a point at least
worth considering.&nbsp; Why is it good Jane is paired with John and not the would-be
Asgardian?" </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>"More that it's good
that you're not paired with John," Quinn replied. "Granted, all boys seem to
have their Upchuck moments; John is a bit more likely than Theo to come out
with one among the boys, although not directly to girls.&nbsp; Plus, he tends to be
a little grabby after the third date, but takes 'no' for an answer and is still
willing to go out again.&nbsp; Jane can be firm with him; you might pepper-spray him
first."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>"Two times at the end
of freshman year, and twice last year," Quinn agreed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>Quinn nodded.
"Correct.&nbsp; And no, I never dated Thor.&nbsp; He was already dating a cheerleader in
my year, Cindy, when we moved her.&nbsp; She's the one who was the lead in the local
student ballet company as well the lead soloist in the choir and select choir.&nbsp;
Her family moved to LA last July." Quinn looked at Daria. "They must not be in
any of your classes."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>"I had wondered when
you claimed last spring that there were only three guys in your year smart
enough for you to consider dating," Quinn said. "I could think of at least four
more, although one is somewhat pudgy and, well, gauche, although not like Upchuck,
and the other one is gay.&nbsp; Considering Thor's size, you two might look a little
odd together, but I think you might like him, at least a little, even if you
don't find him attractive." The doorbell rang. "That's for me!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>Daria was thoughtful
on the way to her room.&nbsp; She did note that Helen was chilling a bottle of
sparkling wine, so she reminded herself to make certain her door was shut to
block any celebratory noises they might make.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>Once upstairs, Daria
kept going up into the attic, where she pulled out a box of largely discarded
books, pulling out the two Lawndale yearbooks she had been forced to buy.&nbsp; She
had never even taken off the plastic shrink wrap. &nbsp;She took them down to her
room and unwrapped them. &nbsp;Jane was no more for offering up a yearbook to be
signed than Daria, so Daria had seen no point.&nbsp; She had signed half a dozen her
first year in Lawndale , and last June she had signed Brittany's, Jodie's, and
Mack's ('best wishes, Daria' for Brittany and 'best of luck this summer; you'll
need it, Daria' in both Jodie's and Mack's).&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria looked up her classmate.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>"Theodosius?" she
muttered in surprise. "I can see why he doesn't object to 'Thor'." &nbsp;She looked
at the orchestra page, easily seeing that he dominated his bass viol as well as
the other students.&nbsp; John was also apparent in the cello section.&nbsp; She didn't
hunt through all the filler-photos, but a glance through the 'Activities &amp;
Clubs' section revealed few further photos &ndash; they seemed to be in orchestra,
the concert choir, and football together, while Thor was also in the select
choir.&nbsp; As there had also been two other football players and a wrestler (and three
cheerleaders) in the select choir, it was unlikely he would be harassed for it.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>Looking again at the
towering blond looming over the other fifteen students in the select choir
(selected from the sophomores, juniors, and seniors), Daria realized it was
unlikely this student would be harassed by anyone.</span></p>

Daria looked up Thor's now-ex girlfriend, and decided that she and the girl had
nothing in common in the looks department, other than long thick hair.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";color:black'>Daria shut the
previous year's book and glanced at her slightly fuller closet. "Dammit.&nbsp; Do I
go back, or forward?"&nbsp; A voice in her heard, mimicking Aunt Amy, said, "You
already started down this path, Daria.&nbsp; Can you really go back?"</span></p>

weather for the next day showed it was going to be warm and windy.&nbsp; Daria laid
out one of her two decent print blouses and her windbreaker.&nbsp; After a bit of
hesitation, she put in some eye drops, so she could read tonight and still wear
her contacts in the morning if she wanted.</span></p>
