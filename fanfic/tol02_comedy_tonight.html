ahead.&nbsp; Still, like I said, since you're not doing a complete make-over, wait

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Not especially," Daria answered
with a shake of her head. "John drives a new&nbsp; two-door Chevy Metro, which
usually rates low on her scale, but it is his, it is new and is a convertible,
and she says he keeps in clean, so that makes it a lower-mid-level. . . ."</span></p>

transportation.</span></p>

a reputation as a polite grabber after the third date," Daria pointed out.
"Still, she said you would be firm enough to have him keep his hands where you
want them, no matter where you might want them."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Obviously, he tends towards
taking his dates to the family restaurants, at least casual dates.&nbsp; Quinn
amazingly hadn't known the family owns that gyro chain.&nbsp; She'll add that to her
database.&nbsp; He's dated fairly widely, and yet doesn't have too bad a
reputation.&nbsp; He'll go practically anywhere that doesn't cost an arm and a leg,
although boy band concerts are out."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

mighty Thor?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Theo was dating a cheerleader
who was also a ballerina in Quinn's grade for almost two full years, but she
and her family moved to California over the summer, so he's actually not fully
accounted for by her system," Daria replied. "He drives a small Toyota
short-bed truck with a king cab, and is known as the 'arty' football player
because he is not only in the orchestra, choir, and select choir, but
apparently &nbsp;he enjoyed going to his girl friend's ballet performances.&nbsp; They
were also known to go to opera and orchestra concerts."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

you," Jane conceded. "Does that mean you won't give me grief if I 'dress
conventional' sometimes?"</span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Well, I might if you bring out
that teddy bear backpack, but otherwise, no, I won't," Daria agreed. "What
you're wearing today is good, although they look a bit odd with your running
shoes."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Well, I wouldn't go with the
exact outfit I used for that assignment," Jane added, ignoring the complement
on her Capri pants. "I like my boots too much to want to wear sandals to school
again.&nbsp; So it was either these or the boots, and the boots would look even dumber."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

"I made it clear to Quinn the sort of clothes I would consider, and she agreed
to help."</span></p>

nothing directly.&nbsp; However, with Mom becoming a partner, she should get at
least a fifty percent pay raise.&nbsp; We both figure our getting along like this
will incite her to raise our allowances, plus Quinn said Sandi was a bit ticked
off that we looked so good yesterday when we were both in our usual look.&nbsp; This
should irritate her even more."</span></p>

Abraham Horowitz had always exuded an old-world formality.&nbsp; He had been seen as
a man of experience and grave consideration even as a college student and that
aura had merely grown over the decades.&nbsp; Old money and corporate leaders saw
Abraham Horowitz as an old-style family attorney of multiple generational standing,
the kind they all felt their families and corporations had had in the golden
past. </span></p>

rapidly reorganize itself over the last two days," Abraham said after sitting.
"While we are still deciding who to bring on as the other two new partners, one
of those people will be purely a personal injury attorney.&nbsp; These are the types
of cases we have generally handled only when a current or previous client has
come to us with such a need, or as part of a class action suit.&nbsp; The most
successful firms which deal exclusively with those types of cases are those
which have, in our opinion, rather low-class television ad campaigns.&nbsp; Neither
I nor the other partners feel comfortable with those types of ads."</span></p>

in this area pointed out last evening that if we were to go, at least to the
general public, under the name of 'Lawndale Law,' we could still show ourselves
to our more traditional client base under the name of the partnership.&nbsp; That
would allow the personal injury attorney to sell himself under both his own
name and 'Lawndale Law.'&nbsp; That is, he would represent himself and his associates

practice in the mornings between 7:15-8:15, giving them half an hour to shower

back, as he was carrying a ham and egg sandwich in one hand, and a large orange
juice in the other &ndash; snacks provided by the school for the players to tide them
over until lunch. &nbsp;The Three J's went by next, as they wanted to walk Quinn to

The two groups sometimes had social clashes.&nbsp; While cheerleaders could only
dare to date football players without social pressure, the players could easily
date anyone.&nbsp; The majorettes were the second favorite source of dates for the
football players (despite what Sandi claimed about the fashion club, they had
only moved into the truly popular ranks because of Quinn).&nbsp; Brooke of the
botched nose job had been a majorette, as was Tori, the blonde arbiter of
popularity.</span></p>

(generally) behaved when the players crossed the music department's territory.&nbsp;
(These female groups, some fifty of them, also insured there was a slight
male-to-female imbalance in the regular homerooms.)&nbsp; Every fall, a few of the

some interests besides what goes on here in school and boy bands.&nbsp; Thor's
gotten me interested in serious music and plays and stuff, and I've gotten him

say as the pair sat just like that at a table.&nbsp; Contrary to popular belief,
there were few pre-set tables dividing the social groups, although some of the
real outcasts sat up near the garbage area, where the noise of trays being
unloaded covered up whatever they were saying.&nbsp; A few of the real trouble
makers also had to sit near the teachers' table.&nbsp; Beyond that, it was the
students who made the table, and the unpopular rarely tried to sit where a
popular person was established.</span></p>

table for two years.&nbsp; After all, while they weren't popular, they were far from
the underclass.&nbsp; The few who had tried to verbally harass them back in tenth
grade had been verbally cut to ribbons in return.&nbsp; The two, and the few other
middle-of-the-road loners, were largely left alone at lunch.</span></p>

I was so startled, for a second I didn't know what to do!&nbsp; Then he screamed.&nbsp;
Daria had this thing, it looked a bit like a car aerial, you know, a metal
extension rod?&quot; Jane nodded. &quot;It was about eighteen inches long

where Quinn was already partially checked out. "My sister will take care of the
bags," Quinn told the woman. "I have to run ahead." When she was done, Quinn
told Daria, "I'll see you there!" Since Quinn was now acknowledging her as a
sister in public, Daria merely nodded.</span></p>

"Mom would like you and Jane to come home as soon as you can.&nbsp; When I told her
about the yogurt, she asked if you could pick up small cups for her and Dad."</span></p>

acknowledged, actually glad she and Daria could work together. &nbsp;&nbsp;Daria would
have gladly bought her sister and her friend large cups; she was so pleased

these feeling to the other, of course.</span></p>
