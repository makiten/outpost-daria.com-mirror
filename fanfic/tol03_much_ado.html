her room while Jane left her one bag near the door and gave the Morgendorffers
their frozen yogurt.&nbsp; Daria came down quickly and claimed her honey-vanilla and
mint chocolate chip (one scoop each) ice cream, which allowed Jane to finally
attack her chocolate fudge and mocha (one scoop each) with sprinkles. "What's

Daria acknowledged. "My computer doesn't have the memory or the RAM to do
this." She turned to Jane. "Could you get us access to one of the school's graphics
computers?" These were primarily used for school business, the year book, and
the newspaper, but a few art students and computer club members were allowed to
use them.</span></p>

assistant.&nbsp; Eric's will be overseeing the pool of clerical staff for my junior

was not surprised at her being sidelined.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>In Jane's opinion, Daria had come
up with some good ideas for the ads, and one idea inspired Jane to paint.&nbsp; She
would spend her study halls the rest of the week and a short time after school
(since she actually had study hall for her last period) working on a symbol for
Lawndale Law.&nbsp; Compared with Monday and Tuesday, the rest of the school week
was much more normal for Daria, although Thor and John sat with them each day
at lunch.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jane and John seemed to enjoy
bantering lightly, in a way which had some elements of flirtation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course,
while they had had minimal direct contact over the previous few years, they had
been attending the same schools since kindergarten and had flirted a little in
eighth grade and even casually dated in September of ninth grade.&nbsp; &nbsp;They were
well aware of each other and had kept loose tabs on the other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Theo had attended different
elementary and middle schools, and so Jane really knew little about him.&nbsp; Daria
had learned that he was still not completely over how his long-term girlfriend
had rejected all contact with him since the end of the previous school year &ndash;
she had wanted a 'clean break' when her family had moved to the west coast.&nbsp; He
was over any romantic attachment with her, however.&nbsp; None of the four were
looking for high, long-term romance, none wanted a series of casual dates, and
so all four were interested in seeing if they could at least work as casual
couples.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>When Jake got home that Friday
afternoon a little after 5:30, he was surprised to see Daria coming down the
stairs, fairly dressed up for her &ndash; a lightly preppy-looking rust-colored
collared top, a new (very slightly shorter) version of her black pleated skirt,
and carrying a very nice jacket.&nbsp; She was of course wearing her boots, but they
carried a higher gloss than normal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

not to mention the entire pep squad and all other would-be popular girls from
the entire area are at the mall to see <i>Bring It On</i>, a movie about people
like them," Daria said drolly. "Mom is at that dinner to meet the firm's three
largest clients socially.&nbsp; And I, remember, have a date."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"No," Daria replied flatly. "The
six of us are going to dinner as three separate couples, and then we're meeting
at that community theater over in Oakwood to watch Shakespeare's <i>Much Ado
About Nothing</i>.&nbsp; Afterwards, we'll probably stop for coffee or ice cream or
whatever someplace. Here," she handed Jake a piece of paper with the
information. "Just in case Mom forgot."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jake opened the door and found
himself looking into the chest of a very large person.&nbsp; As his neck tilted
back, his eyes went wider.&nbsp; Jake gaped for a second, and then managed to ask,
"Thor?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

skipped over to the door and went up on her toes. "Thanks, Daddy!" she said in
her best approximation of Quinn as she kissed his cheek. "See you later." She
grasped Thor's arm with hers and giggled. "Bye, Daddy!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Seeing Jake's stunned look, Daria

fabulous appetizers!"</span></p>

professionally competent manner was important to her, and she did not want to
be distracted.&nbsp; She was a bit afraid of repeating what had happened when she

about the computer software than she or Jane did.&nbsp; A large number of images and
even a few sounds were needed, and John and Thor proved equal to Jane and Daria

was a test of their behavior.&nbsp; When John heard there would likely be no one at
the Lanes', he suggested they stop off at the supermarket.&nbsp; They rented some
old 50's sci-fi films as well, and John put together a pasta and pesto dish
before they watched the first movie that would have made Daria's father green
with envy had he tried it.&nbsp; Rather than microwave popcorn, they had picked up
some Jiffy Pop.&nbsp; And, while the two couples got very cozy on the sofas, both
Daria and Jane were happy the boys tried nothing more than the 'arm over the

group to a conference room, which had a soft divider splitting the room. "I'll
be right back," Quinn said nervously. "Then, when you're ready, I'll open the

the divider, and sure enough, there were fourteen people besides Quinn on the

two of the others sat in the front row along with the partners and Jake.</span></p>

said calmly and levelly. "When we were given this opportunity, my colleague Ms
Lane and I believed that one of the two places we needed to start was by
creating a symbol for the new firm, one easily recognizable on-line and in any
print or television advertisements.&nbsp; Due to a miscommunication, the easel
available really isn't up to the sign's weight, so if Mister Villars and Mister
Yanuzzi could steady the sign and the easel respectively?"</span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The acrylic painting stood four
foot high and five foot wide, the wood stained dark.&nbsp; On the left side was a
reproduction of the County Court House, slightly stylized.&nbsp; By doing so, at a
distance (or in a distant focus, such as a web icon or on video), it was
recognizable but clear.&nbsp; And yet, in closer focus, it had remarkable detail.&nbsp;
The right side of the painting showed the scales of justice in the same style
as was just discernable in the scales on the top of the Court House.&nbsp; The left
scale held a reproduction of Lawndale's Giant Strawberry, the right the town's Civil
War statue.&nbsp; As the Court House was done mostly in light and dark grays, the
scales in burnished gold, and the statue in its oxidized green copper, the
Strawberry really stood out.&nbsp; The scales were just a bit off-balance, giving
more weight to the Strawberry, which had been reproduced to look a bit more
heart-shaped than it actually did, hinting slightly at compassion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

knew the least about, because few people other than his two friends Vitale and
Horowitz knew him personally.&nbsp; He was the firm's primary criminal attorney,
living alone in a small bungalow and usually only showing interest in defending
clients.&nbsp; An only child, orphaned when he had been in college, his wife had
died during his last year of law school.&nbsp; She had been an art major when they
had met as undergraduates, and he was a mostly anonymous patron of various
local art museums.&nbsp; Riordan knew a fair amount about art.</span></p>

for nearly two minutes, Riordan simply said, "Excellent work." That brought the
other senior partners forward.&nbsp; After a brief conference, Riordan approached
Jane as asked, "Other than ads, how would you suggest we use that?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Vitale nodded. "Interesting, and
it will certainly be worth considering, although of course any final decisions
will have to wait until we've made our decisions on that partnership." He
nodded towards the man and woman who had been sharing the front row, obviously
the two lawyers who were under considering, and who were giving nothing away by
their body language.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The group broke up.&nbsp; Helen started
to try and move Daria from the group, but a glint in her eldest's eye told her
not to get too close to her. "Excellent job, Daria." She glanced at Thor and
John, uncertain what was going on. "We'll talk tonight."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Helen winced but left to join the
others.&nbsp; When Jake was left alone with Quinn and the quartet, he motioned to
Daria, "Vitale really did spring the idea on her last night.&nbsp; She decided you
would be less nervous if she didn't mention anything to you."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I don't appreciate surprises,"
Daria replied. "If the partners had hated it, or thought it was silly or worse,
juvenile, it would have undermined Mom's standing with them, not to mention
yours.&nbsp; You both needed to see these before letting them.&nbsp; I don't need that
kind of pressure, and it also means I can't trust Mom not to do it to me
again."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I understand," Jake said. "On a
lighter note, I promised you a thousand if you delivered, and you certainly
did.&nbsp; How do I divide it?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria thought about that, and
then said, "A hundred and twenty five each for Theo and John, three-fifty for
Jane, and four hundred for me."&nbsp; She looked at Quinn. "Since Quinn was working
for the firm and not for us, I'd say Mom owes her at least twenty-five,
especially since she did such a good job." Quinn smiled, as she could tell
Daria was serious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>John and Thor looked shocked that
Daria thought they deserved anything. "We were just helping. . . ." Thor
started, but Daria shook her head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"No, you gave up your Saturday
and Sunday afternoons, and you did about as much as Jane and I did in putting
the actual ads together.&nbsp; John, you really helped on the computer as well, and
the three of you did most of the camera work.&nbsp; Jane, I'd think you deserved
more, but you are getting paid for the sign separately, which we didn't
anticipate."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"The idea was mostly yours," Jane
replied. "I'll agree to this, if you'd take a third of whatever they pay me."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Okay, I'll take something but a
third's too much," Daria said reluctantly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Remember, you're my agent," Jane
said. "You negotiate with your Mom.&nbsp; You'll deserve a third."</span></p>

nodded.</span></p>
