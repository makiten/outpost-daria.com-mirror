<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Despite the fact it was a Tuesday
morning (the day after Labor Day), it was still the first day of school after a
much busier than usual week and weekend.&nbsp; The confrontation between Helen and
Daria Sunday night had been intense, although Helen had wound up backing down
and apologizing.&nbsp; Daria had spent the previous morning mostly in bed with a
tension headache and the afternoon talking with Quinn.&nbsp; Therefore, neither Jane
nor (especially) Daria had as much energy as they had had the previous week.&nbsp;
Daria was again dressed in her green jacket, although with a slightly-more
upscale shirt than usual, while Jane was fully back to new versions of her old
clothes.&nbsp; Daria was about to explain to Jane about her deal with her mother on
the sign for the law firm when she saw someone looking at them a little
wistfully. "Hey, Andrea," Daria said as the pair passed the Goth by.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

"look who's back in school."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

confused.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I thought you two had gone
preppy," Andrea answered simply with a careless shrug.&nbsp; Inside, however, she
braced for an attack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jane bristled a little, but had
not had enough caffeine yet to get angry.&nbsp; Daria merely looked at Andrea
searchingly, which made the other teen a bit nervous.&nbsp; Finally, Daria said, "I
can see where you might think we've changed, gone preppy, or even sold out. Just
in case you're curious, at my last school, girls, even fairly unattractive ones
like I was," (Andrea blinked at Daria's description of herself &ndash; while she had
thought Daria didn't care about her looks, she had not realized Daria actually
sometimes thought herself in anyway unattractive) "had to dress down if we
didn't want constant harassment in the hallways.&nbsp; I picked this outfit when we
moved here because I was hoping the corridors would be at least a little safer,
which they are.&nbsp; I stuck with it because it's comfortable, and because it
pissed off my mother and sister.&nbsp; That's getting old.&nbsp; I still like this look,
but I want to branch out."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Remember how I dressed in ninth
grade?" Jane asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Like you did for that week last
year, for that idiot O'Neill," Andrea answered. "The popular crowd still ended
up cutting you down, hard."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"They did," Jane had to agree.&nbsp;
She looked at Daria. "They teased, I teased back.&nbsp; Then they got nasty,
especially the sophomores, because I wouldn't play some of the power games they
liked, and so they were happy to put down an uppity fresher who they decided
should be an outcaste.&nbsp; Things got nastier, but then I just gave up.&nbsp; That's
how I first got stuck in that stupid self-esteem class." Jane turned back to
Andrea. "You must know how I live, Andrea, especially during most of ninth and
part of tenth grade; you hang out at McGrundy's and know the Harpies." Back to
Daria. "Everyone was gone most of the time, except me and Trent of course, and
it got worse after that Thanksgiving, right after I got the first two of this
type of outfit.&nbsp; After that, for the next year I had a choice, use the money I
had access to keep the utilities at Casa Lane paid and put at least one meal a
day on the table outside of school or on things like clothes.&nbsp; Fortunately,
that crisis over the mortgage you wandered into just after we met was the low
point." Jane turned back to Andrea again. "I didn't have the money for more
clothes."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Sorry to bring up bad memories,"
Andrea said. "It was kind of cool watching you dis most of the really cool
kids.&nbsp; Now, you're moving up in popularity and dating football players."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"We prefer to think of them as
orchestra geeks who play football," Jane said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Andrea rolled her eyes. "John,
maybe, although with his family's money some would still be after him even if
he looked like a geek, which he doesn't. But Thor? Even if he's the better
musician, he's too hard to miss." She held her hands up. "And just about every
straight or bi chick in school drools over Thor at some point.&nbsp; Even me."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"We are changing," Daria
admitted. "We got lucky this summer, and are on a lucky streak, which will no
doubt crash at any time.&nbsp; But right now, we have the chances to jump start our
careers a bit, and that means dressing the part.&nbsp; John and Theo are part of
that lucky streak; we'll see if they hang around after the crash."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Andrea actually grinned. "So, you
really are selling out," she teased.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"We're at least acquiring the
skills we'll need to sell out later," Jane retorted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Okay, you're selling out a bit,
but at least someone is buying," Andrea bantered back.&nbsp; She shrugged. "I can't
argue, since I'm sort of trying to do the same."&nbsp; She glanced at Daria. "By the
way, if you and Thor are hitting it off, I don't think he'd be the kind who
bails."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Thank you."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Hey," Jane said, "are you still
seeing that Goth from Carter County Consolidated?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Leon?&nbsp; Yeah, why?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jane glanced at Daria for a
moment, then said, "John and Thor agreed to come help us welcome Trent and the
Spiral back when they play the McGrundy's Friday night.&nbsp; You and Leon want to
join us?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Andrea laughed. "McGundy's?&nbsp; It's
been a while since they were allowed to play there on a weeknight for free, let
alone on a Friday night.&nbsp; And I don't know who us all meeting there that would
spook more, John or Leon, since I doubt Thor can be spooked." She looked at
Daria. "What do you think?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"If you and Leon join us, that
would triple the group willing to pretend they like the band," Daria mused.
"Okay."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"We can only stay for the first
set," Andrea said.&nbsp; She flushed for a second, and added, "I need to try the SAT
again Saturday.&nbsp; Or at least try it sober."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Are you going to Oakwood High to
take it?" Daria asked.&nbsp; When Andrea nodded, Daria told her, "Jane and Quinn
have to go, too, and I'm taking some CLEP exams.&nbsp; I'm driving anyway, if you
need a ride."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I'll need a crap load of
coffee," Andrea said, partially to herself. "Sure.&nbsp; Pick me up at six-thirty at
the diner on Degas?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Okay.&nbsp; Have a triple ready for
her and we'll call it even," Daria said, jabbing a thumb at Jane. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Thanks!" Andrea said thankfully.
"I'll even be on time."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Considering how much bitching
and moaning the other two will be doing about how early we have to leave, you
better be, because I won't wait," Daria warned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I would be disappointed if you
did," Andrea assured her.&nbsp; She was pleased when Daria gave her a small smile as
the two moved on to their lockers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"What was that all about?" Daria
asked curiously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"We've always been friendly with
Andrea, and I even like her, but we've never hung out or anything.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Exactly.&nbsp; Now, more importantly,
what about the sign?&nbsp; Did you and your Mom come to an agreement?" Jane urged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Five hundred upfront," Daria
replied. "Mom of course knows how you feel about artists' rights over their
images, but as she said, this was more a commercial design."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

reproduce the design as part of your artist portfolio and so on &ndash; I have the

that they use your design, if any one breaks your copyright over your images &ndash;
remember, that's what you retain because of that contract we did for your
regular art &ndash; the firm will sue their asses off for you, although as a further
incentive to make certain they pursue such cases, they get fifty percent of any

Jane's screaming alerted the students enough to start clearing an area around
them.&nbsp; The only person mentioned as a possible suspect was Jeremy Steele, the
j.v. quarterback who had had a run-in with Daria and friends the week before.&nbsp;
However, one tape showed him clearly moving into the crowded area from the
wrong direction a few seconds after Daria had to have been pushed.&nbsp; He was
lucky he could convince Ms Li (who recorded the interview she had with him

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"What?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Quinn nodded to their left, where
her mother and three men were seen talking with Ms Li and the security chief.&nbsp;
Two of them went off with the security chief, while the older man and Helen
went off with Ms Li.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"That's Mister Vitale, the senior
partner at Mom's firm," Quinn said, now pitching her voice so that only the
three other girls could hear. "He's also one of the county commissioners."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Tiffany and even Stacy looked
confused by that, but Sandi merely nodded.&nbsp; She was not very bright, but both
her parents discussed local and state government constantly.&nbsp; She understood
that Mrs. Morgendorffer had brought the biggest gun she could find to Lawndale
High to insure she got answers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Ms Li led the pair to her office,
not questioning why the two security company people wanted to check the site of
the assault &ndash; they had come to see if the security cameras had been poorly
placed, and she knew all the cameras had been placed well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"What can I do for you, Ms
Morgendorffer?&nbsp; Commissioner Vitale?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I believe you have been briefed
by the police on my daughter's injuries?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I have, and I am quite grateful
they were somewhat less than we had thought," Ms Li agreed. "I hope she will be
returning to Laaawndale High soon."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Barring unforeseen
complications, she should be released from the hospital today or tomorrow,"
Helen replied. "She will need a protective brace, perhaps even a light air
cast, for some weeks.&nbsp; To deal with the academic side first, do you foresee any
problem with her not taking gym for at least this term and perhaps the next,
and only doing some other form of exercise which you could guarantee could not
stress her arm?&nbsp; I should mention that her physicians gave me that advice, and
will be sending it to you in writing.&nbsp; Daria has at least tentative acceptances
at Bromwell and Raft, and I do NOT want those endangered."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Ms Li was very aware of the
conflicts between Ms Morris and Daria, the only real conflict she had with the
staff, despite Mr. O'Neill's dealings with her. "Please consult your
physician.&nbsp; If he approves, your daughter can spend gym period power walking, and
Ms Morris will approve it." Bragging to the other area educators about a
Bromwell, or even Raft, student was more than worth risking having to listen to
Coach Morris complain.&nbsp; Still, Morris could at times be reasonable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I will pass that on," Helen replied.
&quot;The only other academic problem is that Daria cannot type for at least
four weeks.&nbsp; In fact, for the next week or so, she may even have difficulties,
well, dressing herself, including using the girls' room.&nbsp; Jane Lane said she
would help there.&nbsp; Jane also said that she was not aware of any major writing
assignments, but could you arrange for someone to check with her instructors,
and allow Jane to accompany Daria to the restroom until her hand recovers some
of its strength and dexterity?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Of course," Ms Li agreed. 'Nothing
outrageous so far,' Li thought. 'I wonder if Vitale came along just to insure
those investigators got in?' "In fact, tell Ms Lane I shall count that as a
community volunteer effort."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Thank you.&nbsp; I'll be certain to
tell her.&nbsp; Now to the more unpleasant discussion," Helen went on, which made
the Principal straighten up in her chair. "Daria was not only shoved hard
enough to leave a bruise on her back, which would really make it more of a
punch than a push, she also remembers being tripped at the same time.&nbsp; The
perpetrator must be strong, to hit her that hard in a tight crowd, and very
coordinated, as no one else seemed to trip until Daria was on the ground.&nbsp; He,
or she, must also have been a bit below the average height of the students in
that crowd, otherwise the assault would have been caught on at least one of
your cameras."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Ms Li merely folded her hands and
nodded. "Quite likely." She had viewed the tapes often enough to have to agree.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"That means it was no accident,"
Vitale pointed out. "It is of course not known if Ms Morgendorffer was the
intended target from the start or a target of opportunity by someone who just
wanted to cause anyone pain."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

certain that no other girl in the school could have been mistaken for Daria as
she was dressed yesterday," Helen added.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Her green jackets have been her
trademark," Ms Li agreed. "Did either of your daughters, or Ms Lane, mention
any enemies, anyone they suspected?" She did not mention that she had double checked,
and Quinn, surrounded by six boys, had been seen by one camera chatting away
happily at the time of the attack.&nbsp; Ms Li never doubted the power of sibling
rivalry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"No, no enemies," Helen replied. "However,
Jane did recall an incident last week in the cafeteria. . . ."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"With young Jeremy Steele," Ms Li
agreed. "Mister Yanuzzi mentioned it to me yesterday.&nbsp; Mister Steele was caught
by a camera some distance away for the incident when it happened.&nbsp; I pointed that
out to the police yesterday evening.&nbsp; I was rather hoping to have at least a
few more names to check out."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"While my daughter is no joiner,
as you well know, and can be somewhat abrasive to those who bother her, I don't
believe she's the kind of girl to actually have enemies," Helen stated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Li wasn't going to argue that
point. "Nevertheless, it is possible some student sees her at such," she
pointed out. "Obviously, we will do what we can. . . ."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Yes, well, we can't really have
bodyguards with Daria at school, despite what my husband wishes.&nbsp; However, we
are hoping that you could encourage the faculty to indulge some of her friends
which they feel the need to escort Daria in the hallways, especially during
lunch."</span></p>

thought about the position the school was in &ndash; the budget was tightening on all
fronts, the teachers' contract would be up the following spring, and if there

wanted.</span></p>
