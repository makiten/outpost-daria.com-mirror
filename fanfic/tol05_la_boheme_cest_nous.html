Daria was somehow disappointed in herself. "You couldn't have done anything to
stop this attack, and we don't know what wacko did it, so we don't know you

endure years of dance class, and Quinn's told me you did some martial art in

Jane replied. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"All past tense," Daria agreed, "and
you should know Quinn often gets details very wrong.&nbsp; She thinks I was some
feared psycho bitch in Highland, when the truth is I beat up that one guy.&nbsp; If
I was feared, it was in part because Quinn was not the only person terrified of
being near the dumb duo, and by the end of ninth grade I could get the two of
them to do really stupid things to themselves &ndash; which impressed other people,
who didn't seem to realize that the idiots tortured each other in every way far
more than I ever tortured them mentally.&nbsp; Everyone else figured that if I could
manipulate two idiots so stupid as to make Kevin look at least above average,
maybe I could do it to them if they pissed me off."</span></p>

training, but it was no formal martial art.&nbsp; Some of it was with a group of
feminists who made Barch look sweet and man-crazy, and the rest was at Billy
Bob's School of Rasslin' and Self Defense."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Yep, sure 'nuff did," Daria
replied with a drawl Jane had never heard before.&nbsp; Before Jane could comment,
Daria was talking again with her usual accent. "Billy Bob was an
ex-pro-wrestler, and his wife, Sweet Darlin', had played his manager.&nbsp; Billy
Bob was also an ex-state high school wrestling champion.&nbsp; He taught amateur
wrestling, and he and his wife taught both self-defense and coached
pro-wrestling wannabes."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jane frowned. "Isn't it all
fake?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Think of it as choreographed
exhibitions," Daria corrected. "They teach you how to pull a punch so it only
stings like hell instead of really injuring you, but that also teaches you how
to punch someone's lights out without breaking your fist.&nbsp; Every hold is real
and most are potentially very painful &ndash; you have to learn both to be
successful.&nbsp; We, on the other hand, were never taught how to hold back, just
how to hurt people.&nbsp; So, no, it's not fake. &nbsp;As Billy Bob said, 'Ya cain't fake
jumpin' off''n the top rope, missin' your man and landin' on a thin rubba mat'.&nbsp;
What pisses me off is that I know how to fall.&nbsp; Hell, I taught you!&nbsp; The second
thing I learned from Sweet Darlin' was how to fall forward and hit the floor
without getting hurt, even when surprised."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"What was the first thing?" Jane
asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"The back bump, falling backwards
and spreading the impact over your full back and even your upper arms, without
hitting your head," Daria groused. "I was damn good at both; scared Dad once
doing a back bump off the third step of a ladder.&nbsp; Even tripped and pushed, I
should not have hurt my arm and wrist as badly as I did, and I sure shouldn't
have had a concussion, because I should have been able to stop my momentum
before my head hit the wall right before it hit the ground.&nbsp; So no, I can't be
upset about not foreseeing the attack; I can be for reacting so poorly to it."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

idiots."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Would you care to explain your
jacket of doom then?&nbsp; Or should that be jackets?&nbsp; Either way, that blood scared
me, Daria," Jane complained.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I'm sorry," Daria replied
contritely. "I know; I went overboard.&nbsp; I had just invented Melody Powers that
summer and liked the idea of James Bond gadgets.&nbsp; I'll take the knife out of
the other jacket, although I'll leave the fiber knuckle-duster I have in that
one."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Part of me actually wishes I
could," Daria admitted. She held up her left arm.&nbsp; &quot;No typing for four
weeks; and this thing stays on except in the shower for at least three, maybe
even eight or ten weeks.&nbsp; I'll have it x-rayed or whatever it was they did when
I was out of it yesterday at least twice more.&nbsp; Mom called, and said she
couldn't really get me out of gym class, so I'll be the runners' bane instead."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>By 8:00 that night, Jane had
agreed to move into the spare bedroom for the next two weeks to help Daria.
Helen and Daria had then had a confrontation, which Daria won on all three
major counts, although she did have to agree to some minor compromises.&nbsp; She
would not be going to school the next day, but for psychological reasons rather
than physical; she would be allowed to go to McGrundy's the next night, but
Thor and Jane were to bring her straight home at the first sight of fatigue
(plus Helen wanted to finally meet Thor and John; the two boys would have
supper at the Morgendorffers after practice the next night); and Helen would
drive Quinn, Jane, Daria, and Andrea to Oakwood Saturday morning for the exams.</span></p>

night, but was up with the rest of the household.&nbsp; She refused to get dressed
(or rather, she refused to let Jane or Quinn dress her).&nbsp; She would wait and
shower just before Jane came back that afternoon, and only then start to dress
for her date that night.&nbsp; She promised her mother she wouldn't just lie around
the house so easily that Helen was almost shocked.</span></p>

word.&nbsp; She spent the morning striding through the house, especially up and down
the stairs, listening to all the radios in the house.&nbsp; She was tempted to do a
back bump from the stairs to the floor just to prove to herself she could do it
right, but decided not to out of consideration for the severity of her
injuries, especially if she made a mistake and landed wrong.</span></p>

her left hand was still too weak to even hold a soup can for the can opener,
never mind trying to hold one with a pop-top firmly enough open it.&nbsp; Even a can
of soda was too difficult to open without risking it fizzing all over, as was
opening an already opened jar of salsa in the fridge.&nbsp; Finally, she looked
through the freezer and found a Lean Cuisine, even if she had to use scissors
to mangle to box enough to access it and a knife to cut through the plastic
film, since she couldn't pull that off yet either.</span></p>

the security tapes her mother had left for her to review.&nbsp; She wondered if her
attacker had gotten away with it out of sheer dumb luck, or if he (Daria
thought of her attacker as a he, although for no reason) really knew the layout
and capabilities of the security cameras that well.&nbsp; She knew their layout, but

concern of her friends' faces, but she was a little shocked at just how angry
and frightened Thor had also looked.&nbsp; As she was taken away, he and especially Jane
looked positively anguished.&nbsp; The look of concern of DeMartino's face was also
a bit surprising.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>While this would be the first
time the dining room was used outside of holiday meals, dinner was just a large
amount of take-out Chinese, with plenty of shrimp fried rice for Thor.&nbsp; Helen
noticed with bemusement that Daria, usually a determined devourer of red meat
whenever given a chance, followed her date's preferred Friday menu choices,
apparently without noticing it (although Jane had).</span></p>

was difficult for Helen to determine how taken Daria might be with Theo.&nbsp; He
seemed at least a tad besotted, certainly more than John and Jane seemed of

'authentic' enough, just before he started at Lawndale State. &nbsp;Leon left about
the same time.&nbsp; Leon went Goth, while Nathan has gotten involved with a group

band had been playing a lot &ndash; they never really practiced hard, so the constant

July.&nbsp; Their prices surprised her &ndash; the walls will have to be replastered.&nbsp; I
think that's why she just redid the furniture and took out that broken tv and
its mounting.&nbsp; I think she also knows once I leave for college, I won't be back
a lot &ndash; that was certainly true for her and Aunt Amy, and they weren't going as
far away as I likely will, even if I get along with Mom a lot better than they
did with Grandmother."</span></p>

that even though you've explored my room, I've never really explored yours.&nbsp; I
drew an outline of the views before I came in, and I got all the major features
right, but while I knew you now have the three bookcases, and that one mostly

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jane nodded and went over to the
bookshelf with the cds. &nbsp;Daria now had three sets of bookshelves instead of two.&nbsp;
One sat to the left of her computer station, and held her notebooks, reference
works in four languages, and books she was either reading or was planning on
reading.&nbsp; Another had books she enjoyed rereading &ndash; Daria had told Jane long
before that she had many boxes of other books and cds in the attic. &nbsp;The
remaining bookcase originally had four shelves, but Daria had added thin slats
dividing the top three shelves in half, each just large enough for a cd case.&nbsp; She
did not keep her cd/radio player there, that was on the top of a set of drawers
to the right of her computer station, along with a some thirty cds, mostly
grunge rock she used to drown out Quinn's boy band music, and some more
relaxing 'ambient' music she listened to in bed with headphones. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The top of the bookcase had
always been what had drawn Jane's attention &ndash; in eighth and ninth grade, Daria
had considered careers in both medicine and physical anthropology.&nbsp; This is
where she now kept replicas of a Neanderthal and the Taung Baby she had brought
with her to Lawndale, since joined by a replica of a hydrocephalic skull.&nbsp; They
certain drew attention away from the cds and books below, which was in fact
what Daria had planned when she set up the room a few weeks before. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The first split shelf had a
nearly full bottom half, while the upper was about half full.&nbsp; The bottom had a
wide range of the music Jane had expected: everything from '60s acid rock
through various types of hard rock and grunge.&nbsp; The upper half was a bit more
unexpected: serious R&amp;B and rappers like Tupak and Biggie Smalls.&nbsp; Jane did
note that most all the cds in Daria's collection had been bought used, which
helped explained how she had accumulated so many.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The two sections of the next
shelf were both nearly as full as the bottom half of the first.&nbsp; The top had
softer rock and pop performers, from Bill Haley and all the Beatle albums through
the most recent Dixie Chicks album, along with the sound tracks to over twenty
musicals.&nbsp; The bottom was filled with jazz, from rag and Dixieland through the
big bands and on to current freeform, although Jane didn't recognize artists
like Kidd Jordan or other avant-garde players.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

tell stories.&nbsp; A song can be a poem or even a short story.&nbsp; A musical is just a
play set to music," Daria replied with a shrug. "I don't need to love the genre

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Except for some of the big band
music, most of it is about a mood or emotion.&nbsp; That's how I react to it anyway.&nbsp;
Some of the real avant-garde can sound like plain noise, but some really connects
to emotion, at least for me." Her mouth quirked. "The ones that are just noise
to me I trade back in.&nbsp; I get enough plain noise masquerading as music from <i>Mystic
Spiral</i>."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Too true." Jane turned to the
last shelf devoted to music.&nbsp; The top half was mostly international music, from
any culture, although Jane noted there were only three Celtic cds.&nbsp; There were
also some cds by composers like John Cage and Philip Glass as well as some 'space,'
New Age, and Ambient music from artists like Kitaro and John Serrie. &nbsp;&nbsp;The
bottom was the 'classical' section, although the music ranged from Medieval to
contemporary.&nbsp; &nbsp;Jane didn't know enough about it to recognize that &ndash; other than
cds of Beethoven's 3<sup>rd</sup>/5<sup>th</sup> symphonies and his 9<sup>th</sup>,
Berlioz' <i>Symphonie Fantastique</i>, and most of Wagner's operas &ndash; the actual
'classical' and 19<sup>th</sup> century composers were limited to string
quartets and a few Liszt piano works.&nbsp; There were more Baroque and 20<sup>th</sup>
century music than from the classical period and 19<sup>th</sup> century.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The bottom shelf was
three-quarters full of reference books on art, music, photography, and film,
although Jane noticed that nearly all of the photography books were of nudes
(more males than females), despite their innocuous titles.&nbsp; She gave Daria a
look as she showed one of them on the 'male nude' to Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"No, no.&nbsp; You have good taste,

Canterbury Tales</i> (one of the original Middle English, one of a 19<sup>th</sup>
century adaptation) to <i>HOWL</i>.</span></p>

the next week of school but could think of no way to get out of attending.&nbsp;
Jake drove her and Jane to school each day, but they would have to walk back,
as neither he nor Helen could take the time off to get them, and of course
Thor, John, and Mack had football practice after school.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>It was a bit embarrassing to need
Jane to help her in and out of the toilet stalls and to help with her books and
notebooks.&nbsp; At least she was able to take her own notes.&nbsp; She hoped the
swelling of her hand and wrist went down soon, so she could at least handle her
own clothing needs.&nbsp; To her surprise, others helped Jane help her with the
books and also with her lunch tray.&nbsp; Even Jeremy helped once.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Even more surprising to Daria and
Jane was Coach Morris' reaction.&nbsp; She just handed Daria hall passes for the two
gym classes that week. "We're going to be out running track," she told Daria
the first day. "Stay in the air conditioning but walk the hallways," she told
Daria. "Since the halls are deserted, the cameras will keep an eye on you.&nbsp;
When your sprain heals enough for you to dress yourself, we'll progress you to
at least power walking."</span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Had the attacker not overheard a
few remarks from different students which had planted the idea that Daria
needed to be 'taken down' least she overtake Quinn's popularity, there was an
excellent chance that no attack would have been made, on Daria or anyone else.&nbsp;
Now, the attacker stood on a precipice &ndash; knowing that any further attacks on
anyone would have to be carefully planned and frightened of the consequences of
getting caught.&nbsp; The attacker was resisting the idea of planning an attack.&nbsp; If
another attack was made, then the attacker would almost certainly escalate the
attacks until being caught, although of course that thought would not occur to
the student for a while.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"None of this school stuff really
interests you because you want to be doing adult things, writing and living on
your own and stuff like that," Brittany replied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Well, we all will have to do
that sometime," Brittany had to agree. "But I see, and I'm sure you do too
'cause you're so smart, how hard it will be.&nbsp; I'm not in any hurry.&nbsp; I like
having fun and stuff, and I know someday I won't have time for it and so I want
to have as much fun as I can now and that includes stuff like pep rally day!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria winced slightly, as
Brittany's voice had hit a squeak at the end of her statement that was even
higher-pitched than usual. "Since you have a good grasp of the situation," she
managed to reply, "I can't argue with your choice."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Brittany blinked, and then
realized that, somehow, she had been given a real compliment.&nbsp; "Are you coming
to the game tonight, or is it too far away?" Brittany merely asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Too far, although maybe when I'm
feeling better I might make some of the other away games," Daria said. "Give
Theo and John some extra cheers for me and Jane."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>As Daria took her seat in
homeroom, her mind was on the implications of her conversation with Brittany
and on the trip to the opera that night.&nbsp; As such, she missed the implications
of Ms Li's remark that there would be a 'school review meeting' that evening
when the announcements were made.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Since Quinn did not drive yet and
Daria still couldn't drive because of her sprained wrist and thumb, Jake was
persuaded to allow Jane to drive his Lexis.&nbsp; Quinn was wearing the dress she
had worn to the Prom four months before, despite protests that it was really a
formal spring evening dress, not autumn.&nbsp; Jane had rooted through the Lane
attic and had come up with a formal-looking number that she thought Summer had
worn to her Prom.&nbsp; Daria had wanted to just have her bridesmaid dress refitted,
but that had been voted down by Quinn, Jane, and Helen.&nbsp; She ended up with a
formal green long dress so dark it looked black at first glance, a black bridge
jacket with dark green trim, and a new pair of formal low heel boots.&nbsp; When the
group had picked up Andrea, she was wearing a Victorian mourning ensemble,
black glitter eye makeup, and both lace gloves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>As Daria had predicted, Jane and
Andrea enjoyed the interplay of the quartet of young Bohemians through most of
the first act.&nbsp; Jane gave her rather snickering side glances as they burned
Rodolfo's play for warmth.&nbsp; Quinn, of course, preferred the duet between Rodolfo
and Mimi.&nbsp; All four enjoyed the street scene which made up the second act,
although Daria wondered if her sister could understand that the only difference
between how Quinn and Musetta used men was that at least Musetta sometimes
bestowed sexual favors in return.&nbsp; The third act made all three wrinkle their
noses, and Daria had to explain Mimi's illness and the basic ideas behind the
plot, which the turn-of-the-last-century audience would have been more familiar
with.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The end of the opera, unsurprisingly,
left Quinn in tears, but Daria noticed that Andrea's eye makeup was also smudging
and Jane's eyes were glistening as the curtain came down.&nbsp; While she was glad
this was a decent production, Daria was grateful it was not as powerfully
presented as a few she had seen on PBS or video, which had drawn a tear or two
even from her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>On the way back to Lawndale,
Daria treated Andrea and Jane to milkshakes (Quinn of course had a small frozen
yoghurt).&nbsp; As Jane fastened Daria's seatbelt for her, Daria asked, "I take it
none of you hated it as much as you thought you would."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Are there more operas like that
one?" Quinn asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"'Like that' in what way?" Daria
asked. "There are plenty of tragic or romantic Italian operas, not to mention
both tragic and romantic, most without plots that good.&nbsp; The local public radio
station broadcasts <i>Live from the Met</i> during most of the Metropolitan
Opera season, starting in a few weeks, but the problem there is you can only
hear it.&nbsp; The larger <i>Lackluster Video</i> has a few with subtitles, and so
does <i>Art Videos</i> just off Degas Street.&nbsp; I think <i>Viv's Videoes</i>
downtown might have a few, too."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Maybe we could watch a few
together?" Quinn suggested.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

you two?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I could see us living a bit like
that in college," Jane replied, "although hopefully with less poverty and
death."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"In reality, the characters were
the ages of college students and grad students," Daria agreed. "Colleges didn't
offer degrees in the arts yet, and the ability to live off of writing or
painting instead of patronage was still somewhat new.&nbsp; There were probably
comparatively more opportunities, at least for men, in the arts then than
today, although there was also more competition."</span></p>

that music too much," Andrea said, "but I have to admit, it was interesting."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>All four teens dreamed themselves
into the opera that night. &nbsp;Quinn was surprised when she remembered, for she
was not one of the artists or even Mimi, but Musetta.&nbsp; 'I don't really act that
way, do I?' she thought.&nbsp; The realization that, indeed, she did act that way
disturbed her greatly.&nbsp; Andrea, on the other hand, woke up a bit wistfully when
she realized that she had dreamt of being Musetta.&nbsp; She did not want to be a
tease, but she thought it would be nice to be that attractive to boys.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

pretty powerful.&nbsp; Were you Marcello?" Daria asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I was," Jane agreed. "It was
only you and me in the attic, though.&nbsp; When Tom showed up in furs, I laughed

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria smiled faintly. "I wouldn't
think you would." She looked Jane in the eye. "I dreamed something similar,
although I wasn't Rodolfo, Andrea was.&nbsp; I was Colline, and there wasn't a
fourth person.&nbsp; I don't know about Andrea, but I can think of worse fates that
spending my college years with you as a roommate, but as you said last night,
hopefully with at least less poverty and certainly less death."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jane helped Daria on with her
boots. "It was pretty obvious why I'd dream of being the female counter-part of
Marcello.&nbsp; Were we male in your dream?&nbsp; And why do you think you were Colline
instead of Rodolfo?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"No, we were all us," Daria
replied.&nbsp; Then she thought a bit. "Even though I'm more emotionally open these
days than I was, I think Rodolfo was way too open emotionally.&nbsp; He and Marcello
talk about being a bit cynical in love, but they aren't, especially Rodolfo.&nbsp; I
always rather like Colline &ndash; although I do wish he had a bigger role in the
opera.&nbsp; He was supportive of his friends and seemed to enjoy what he was doing
at least as much as they did."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

of Daria's boots, she was shocked to feel Daria's hand on her shoulder.&nbsp; She
