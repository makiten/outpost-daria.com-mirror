Daria tracked down Jodie in the library while Jane went to the art room to
catch up on some painting.&nbsp; Daria just sat and stared, her eyes moving from

hard to miss; these stick out even more," Daria commented drolly, earning an
eye-roll from Jodie. "Sorry," Daria said.&nbsp; Daria then got serious and asked, "What's
the deal, anyway?&nbsp; Tuesday we had the dispensers in the lunch lines with
generic cola, diet cola, lemon-lime, and orange soda, and two machines in the
actual cafeteria, which offered the same generics, plus root beer.&nbsp; Six
buttons, two for cola, one each for the others.&nbsp; There was also a machine that
sold boxes of fruit juices that were actually mostly fruit juice instead of
sugar and fake flavors.&nbsp; Now the soda has been switched to Ultra Cola and the
fruit juice machine is gone, replaced by another soda machine.&nbsp; We now have at
least seven other soda machines around, each with just four buttons -- three
for Ultra Cola and one with Diet Ultra, and the price has gone up ten cents per
can!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"They also switched the one in
the teacher's lounge, and you missed one other, probably the one at the entrance
to the balcony of the swimming pool" Jodie pointed out. "And, of course, the concessions
at games have also gone from generic to Ultra Cola."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Okay, while I have a problem
with this, for the sake of the argument let's grant that doing so has no moral
ambiguities," Daria said. "That a school not only enters into a commercial
deal, but that part of that deal is such blatant marketing and over-supplying
of the market.&nbsp; Like I said, it bothers me a bit, but I could be wrong about that.&nbsp;
Maybe that's because my last school didn't allow soda in the cafeteria."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Do you mean they did something
better than us?&nbsp; Considering what you've said about that school, it's hard to
believe," Jodie teased.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Well, it wasn't from any high
moral ground," Daria conceded. "Their food was even more unbalanced than here,
they just didn't want the students to be on a sugar or caffeine high.&nbsp; They
even limited the starches they served." Daria shook her head. "On the other
hand, you could get whatever they were passing out as gravy over anything, and
most days you even had the choice of either whatever was supposed to go with
the meat, or what they called simply 'sausage and white gravy.'&nbsp; Plus, they
were happy to let you put as much shredded surplus cheese as you wanted on
anything."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I know.&nbsp; But come on, studies
are suggesting how too much corn-syrup sweetened sodas are contributing to
obesity and diabetes, plus again, should we really be having the students
chugging down sugar and caffeine between classes when a lot of them have
attention problems in the first place?&nbsp; One or even two sodas at lunch time is
one thing. . . ."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Since we both occasionally
indulge," Jodie pointed out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Agreed.&nbsp; But eleven machines all
over the school? &nbsp;Before you say anything about it being the students' choice
not to over-indulge, do you honestly think Ms Li and the suppliers would have
put in that many machines unless they were sure they'd get a good payoff?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Probably not," Jody had to
agree.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Do you know what the payoff is,
by the way?" Daria asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Not the amounts, but Ms Li
thinks it will make up for the short-falls the school's been having."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Of course, at least some of that
has gone to the over-the-top security, and we all know how well that worked
when someone needed it," Daria reminded Jodie, holding up her heavy brace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"True," Jodie agreed. "However, I
do know that some book orders for next term that were on hold have actually
gone through because of this.&nbsp; And, because the switch-over took place before
the first football game, the team can order replacement equipment, and you know
she would have juggled the books somehow to grab that from academics if she had
to."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

posters?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jodie winced. "They are sleazy, but
Ms Li also said that some of clubs wouldn't have to work quite as hard selling
junk door to door and what not because of what she got for advertizing space."
She glared at Daria. "What would you do to get out of being one of twenty
students each having to sell at least five hundred rolls of over-priced,
under-sized holiday wrap so the Model Congress can get a decent bus to go to
Washington?&nbsp; Or so you wouldn't have to stand in front of stores in your band
uniform, selling 'I Support Lawndale' buttons so they can go to the State
University Band Competition?&nbsp; Or, to bring it home, just think, as you make
your leftover turkey sandwich the day after Thanksgiving or drink egg nog the
day or two before Christmas, that the orchestra has to play holiday concerts
for some civic groups to pay for the string program."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Huh?" Daria didn't know about
that one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"It was part of the deal the city
and county made with the school district.&nbsp; They pay for the string program, but
the orchestra has to play six concerts around the county &ndash; two at senior
centers, one at the mall, and one at city hall, all between Thanksgiving and
Christmas, and then two at senior centers in the spring."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Well, I could say that those are
the prices you, the students, pay for participation in the activities, and that
by getting other students to subsidize you via what amounts to a sin tax
without your having to do anything to earn your way, you may be missing out on
important life lessons," Daria retorted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I don't think the so-called 'Puritan
Work Ethic' is necessarily puritan, let alone conservative," Daria retorted. "I
certainly want all students to have a chance to join those groups if they have
the interest, and if some cases, the needed ability, which some might not have
the chance to do if their parents had to pay for it all upfront.&nbsp; I just
question the idea that having other students risk rotting their teeth or
ruining their health in future years instead is an ethical choice."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Okay, I apologize for the
conservative remark if you're not," Jodie said. "But I resent you implying I'm
lazy."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"You are anything but lazy,"
Daria agreed. "I can even understand why you'd be glad for almost anything that
lightens your load.&nbsp; That doesn't apply to most of the other students."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I am sorry if it seemed like I
was attacking you," Daria added. "I suppose this means you think, well, not
that this is good, but that there's nothing you'd want to do to change it?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I don't think there's anything
to do at the moment," Jodie pointed out. "In a sense the company is paying for
advertizing space.&nbsp; We've always sold space in the newspaper and the year book,
and even though we have never had advertisements in the stadium or gym, other
schools do.&nbsp; If anything, I'm surprised it's taken this long to happen.&nbsp; So, as
long as it doesn't get much more egregious, and as long as she doesn't allow
worse companies advertize, who is really going to object?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

good taste," Daria replied, gesturing at the sign. "I think that if this brings
in anything like the money Ms Li hopes for, both she and the company reps will
independently decide more is better."&nbsp; Somewhere, in the back of her mind,
Daria knew she had heard about something similar happening back in Texas, but
she couldn't remember the details.&nbsp; She knew she would have to research it.</span></p>

Daria's complaints about the advertizing, and, with surprise, listened to her
daughter plot out six different plausible scenarios for dealing with Ultra
Cola, depending on how things developed.&nbsp; The only other development Daria
reported on was an offer by Ms. Morris.&nbsp; She had been impressed with Daria's
dedication to walking during gym, and had also noticed Daria was doing the same
immediately after school, before going to study in the library while waiting
for Jane, who sometimes ran for fun and sometimes painted at school for a while.&nbsp;
A Tai Chi group was starting in part of the gym, meeting from 3:45-4:30, and Ms
Morris suggested that, if Daria would keep up the power walking during gym and
attended at least two Tai Chi sessions a week, she could continue to be
dismissed from gym class in most of the second and third trimesters.&nbsp; In the
remaining part, Daria could either continue with the walking/Tai Chi or take
the swimming unit.&nbsp; Since Daria had in fact passed all the swimming
requirements, it was her choice.</span></p>

just presumes you're not only just not positive, but that you are actually
unhappy or depressed, or have a low self-image.&nbsp; Even though I have tried to
hide my physical self, that doesn't mean I didn't realize I have always been at
least average looking." Jane and Quinn both rolled their eyes at that
assessment. Daria went on quietly. "I have never had low self-esteem, and, despite

ranked as an important issue in town and at the school, it was a bit odd that
Lawndale was the only school in the area without a lighted stadium.&nbsp; Daria
suspected it was because that allowed Lawndale to monopolize the both the area
interest in high school football as well as the local radio market in general
on Saturday afternoon, since Lawndale State didn't have a football team.&nbsp; The
game, as usual, started at 1:00, so there was an early lunch at the
Morgendorffers.&nbsp; Jake would drive the three girls to the game, where he would
join a group of clients.&nbsp; Quinn would of course be meeting the rest of the
Fashion Club, while Jane and Daria joined Jodie, who brought them into the
stadium through a back entrance behind the home bleachers and then led them up
into part of the press box which, it turned out, was divided into four
sections.&nbsp; They were in the smallest part, which had lost some of its space to
a stairway going up to an area above the press box, as well as a tiny private
restroom (built under those stairs).</span></p>

newspaper reporters sit in the third.&nbsp; This used to be for school
administrators, until Ms Li's predecessor added the extra seats and that luxury
box superimposed on this one.&nbsp; Normally, the president of the student council

would be needed later in the season, and a small fridge.&nbsp; She leaned over and
opened it.&nbsp; There was a six pack of Ultra Cola and three bottles of water. "Thank

rest of the first half, half time, and into the third quarter.&nbsp; Thor had easily
shut down the inside running game and helped keep a lot of pressure on Green Hollow's
quarterback, resulting in two sacks for Thor, two others by other players, and
two interceptions for the Lion's defense.&nbsp; Green Hollow's defense, however, had
recovered from the shock of the first third of the game, so the score was still
15-0.</span></p>

Daria pointed out. "I asked him once; he was held back in fifth grade but has
had fairly smooth sailing since he hit middle school.&nbsp; Coincidence?&nbsp; I doubt
it.&nbsp; He has been groomed and used by the system, and in eight more weeks, or
four more beyond that if they go all the way to the state championship, his
value to the system becomes zero.&nbsp; They won't flunk him out, but they won't continue
to save him."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

shot," Daria said. "There are a couple of semi-pro leagues around.&nbsp; They have
ex-high school stars who didn't make college or who went into the military
instead of college, or ex-college players.&nbsp; Almost none of them make it even to
a pro training camp, but a few do, usually as walk-ons, even if almost none of
them make it.&nbsp; A few more might make it as far as that Arena Football League.&nbsp; If
all you have is that dream, it must be tough to give up on it."</span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>At that point, Thor nearly got
his third sack.&nbsp; The quarterback released the ball just as he was hit, and the soft
wobbling pass was easily picked up by John, who managed a twenty-seven yard
return to the four yard line.&nbsp; Kevin passed to Jeffey on the first play for a
touchdown, and Mack ran for a two point conversion.&nbsp; That would turn out to be
the final score of the game, 23-0, as the Lawndale defense easily contained the
Green Hollow offense from then on, and the Lawndale offense just missed several
scoring chances.&nbsp; Coming off of a 33-0 win in the opening game, Lawndale had
momentum.&nbsp; Still, it was a long way to go before they could even match the
previous year's record of 8-2.&nbsp; They would almost certainly have to be 10-0 to
have a chance at the State Championship.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Beef-n-Cake was a working class
surf and turf place about a mile outside of town, offering burgers, steaks, and
(of course) Maryland crab cakes amongst other fare.&nbsp; Jane had a burger, medium
fries, and a small cola; Daria the crab cake, small fries, and a small cola.&nbsp;
John had a 16 ounce sirloin, medium fries, and a medium chocolate shake, while
Thor had two twelve ounce sirloins, large fries, and a large chocolate shake.&nbsp;
The quartet also split two large orders of onion rings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Funny you should ask," Jane
said. "I had a brilliant idea yesterday for a really big work!&nbsp; I talked Mrs.
Sloan into donating the canvas, and Ms Defoe gave me tentative permission to
use one of those empty storerooms between the arts area and the stage.&nbsp; If I
can get Ms Li's permission Monday, I'll be working on it after school for the
rest of the year, at least!"</span></p>

my mother and John's mother are both Lawndale natives.&nbsp; Mom even babysat his
mom when she was in high school and his was in elementary school.&nbsp; We were at
each other's birthday parties when we were kids, before Mom started wandering a
few years ago."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Whatever her other faults, Ms Li
had an open door policy.&nbsp; Jane had no trouble getting to see her before
homeroom that Monday.&nbsp; For a project this exciting, Jane easily got herself out
of bed by 7:00 and presented herself, coffee in hand, at the Morgendorffers by
7:20 (for Daria to walk to Jane's first actually added a bit to Daria's
route).&nbsp; Daria still needed help tying her boots, but otherwise was ready to
go, sugar tart in hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

not," Jane admitted. "However, I don't see why that would mean you would
disapprove of my painting it here at school.&nbsp; The painting is certainly not
aimed at Lawndale High.&nbsp; I would gladly not use the school colors if that
bothers you.&nbsp; In fact," Jane added with a smile, "if you want to pick the
colors of some other school that would be fine with me, so long as you tell me
soon.&nbsp; I would add a thank you for the school's accommodation to my artist
statement as well, if you'd like.&nbsp; It would certainly be appropriate."</span></p>

year we cleaned it out when we got rid of those old broken ceramics molds, so
it should be empty except for some small lockers.&nbsp; I could use those to lock my
paints away." Jane held up her hand. "I would of course only use school rental
locks for that." That assured Ms Li that Jane would not use the lockers for any
illegal purpose.</span></p>

like this subject; it was subversive.&nbsp; On the other hand, it would keep Lane, a
border-line problem, very busy and had the support of the Sloan Foundation.&nbsp;
The problem with students like Lane and Morgendorffer was that they were too
smart for the system in some ways, and so caused problems in part out of
boredom.</span></p>
