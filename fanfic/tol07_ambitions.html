happy.&nbsp; He had hoped to string Li along for a few more months until her budget problems

the machine sales were right where he expected them to have been, but he would
never admit that. "I was wondering if you'd like to extend the advertisements?"
He slid a slim folder over, outlining an upswing in advertizing.&nbsp; </span></p>

have it done by the end of the weekend," Lamm replied with a smile. 'Gotcha,'
he thought. &nbsp;He doubted he could trick Li into raising the minimum product
moved for a higher cut, but there was one more step in the ads he might be able
to get out of her, if the football team continued to win.</span></p>

in front of the huge blank canvas, just a little nervous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>She knew she was taking a huge
gamble.&nbsp; Granted, she was certain she could create the painting she had
imagined the previous Friday, and she was certain she could create it in the
style she had envisioned as well.&nbsp; Realism, even photorealism, was well-within
her abilities.&nbsp; But while they presented challenges to technique and vision,
they rarely touched Jane's imagination.&nbsp; At least some of the earlier academic
painters had shown some real imagination, in Jane's opinion.&nbsp; Jane was going to
go beyond the photorealist/hyperrealist schools of painting, which usually
worked almost entirely from photographs.&nbsp; If she could pull it off, she would
have a good reputation going into any art school, and would probably have the
backing of the Sloan Foundation.&nbsp; If she failed, well, only her friends and the
Sloan Foundation would know, and she would be out a large amount of money in
painting supplies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

laughed as she let it out.&nbsp; Win or lose, she was going to enjoy the challenge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>With only a few exceptions caused
by necessity, Jane would paint from 3:30-6:00 every school day until nearly the
Christmas break, and a number of the Saturday mornings as well.&nbsp; Nearly every
day, Daria would come to remind her of the time at 6:00, and at the least John
and Thor would walk them home.&nbsp; Some week nights, one or another of the couples
would go out, and they sometimes went out as a quartet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The first night Thor and Daria
went together was that first Thursday, as she was going to the Villars' to meet
his parents.&nbsp; Thor only had one sibling, an older sister who had just started
medical school in New York.&nbsp; Like Jake and Helen, the Villars had not started
their family until they were thirty, although in their case it was because they
were in graduate school and then looking to start their careers rather than
spending part of their twenties in a commune.&nbsp; They were now in their early
fifties, four years older than Jake and Helen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The Villars lived in a much older
(mostly built in the 1920s and early 1950s, rather than the 1960s and 1970s),
slightly more down-scale mostly skilled working-class part of town than the
Morgendorffers and Lanes, and therefore the houses were also closer together
and a bit smaller.&nbsp; These houses were built with front porches, and it was
clear that the porches were still used, as nearly all had furniture on them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Scholars of class in America have
long noted that the more well-off a family is (and has been in the previous
generation) the later they tend to eat their evening meal.&nbsp; Even though it was
only 6:45, a number of people, especially older couples, had already finished
cleaning up the dinner table and were coming out to sit in the pleasant evening
air.&nbsp; Nearly all waved, and some greeted Thor by name.&nbsp; He, of course, waved back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria should have realized that
someone Thor's size was unlikely to be a complete genetic fluke.&nbsp; However, she
was a bit taken aback when she met his six-foot six father (built along even
broader lines than Thor), and then his slim six-foot three mother.&nbsp; Thor
introduced both his parents as 'Professor Villars.'&nbsp; His father had merely
smiled and shaken Daria's hand.&nbsp; Thor's mother had done the same, but added in
Latin (and in a smiling, pleasing tone), "Welcome, young German girl who comes
to steal my son."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria blinked, and replied using
the same Classical Latin diction but in her old monotone, "I thank you for your
welcome, old scholar who over-protects her son."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Thor and his father, who had both
looked at his mother with startled amazement, burst out laughing.&nbsp; Thor's
mother blushed and apologized. "You didn't tell me she speaks Latin," she
accused good-naturedly if somewhat stiffly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"And Spanish and French," Daria
replied.&nbsp; She could read and understand German, but could not really speak it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The house had a simple plan.&nbsp;
Facing the front from the street, the right two thirds of the house had the
front room and then the dining room behind it.&nbsp; The left front had the entrance
hallway and stairs leading upstairs and down to the basement, with the kitchen
in the back, where some extra space had been added on in a renovation in the
early 1960s.&nbsp; The front of the basement was the den, with a small laundry room
and a small storage area converted into a wine cellar behind.&nbsp; There were three
smallish bedrooms upstairs, plus just one bath, and the attic had been
partially converted over into a library for the family's surplus books.&nbsp; Thor's
parents were both in the community orchestra, a cellist and violist
respectively.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Except for his laughter at his
wife's joke-gone-bad, Thor's father said little.&nbsp; He seemed genial enough, and
his eyes seemed to take in everything around him, but he was certainly not much
of a conversationalist. 'Or maybe he just likes this chicken stew and
dumplings,' Daria thought as the main course followed the salad.&nbsp; To her
surprise, the Villars had a&nbsp; bottle of wine with dinner, and not only served
Thor half a glass but had even talked to her mother and had permission to serve
her about a quarter of a glass.&nbsp; Compared to the wine she had tried the
previous summer, the pink Tavel was a revelation.&nbsp; Then Daria tried the stew. "This
is really good," Daria said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Thank you," Thor's father said.&nbsp;
His wife tried hard to interrogate Daria, but while decent at it, she had
nothing on Helen Morgendorffer and Daria had long ago learned how to (usually)
deflect her mother's questioning.&nbsp; Daria kept the conversation on the
background &ndash; she learned that Thor's mother's family had been &eacute;migr&eacute;s during
the French Revolution to New York City who had salvaged enough money to get
into banking and insurance, occupations many of her relatives were still
involved with. The Villars, on the other hand, had been French-Canadians of
long-standing who had ended up on the wrong side of the Maine border when it
had finally been agreed upon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The Villars were a bit taken
aback as Daria dropped her spoon when it was mentioned that a Villars ancestor
had fought with the 20th Maine at Little Round Top at the Battle of
Gettysburg.&nbsp; Daria then had to explain her mother's strong roots in the Old
South. "I had three ancestors on my mother's side in the Confederate army at
Gettysburg, and the first Morgendorffer in America was there as well, although
he wasn't involved until the third day.&nbsp; Anyway, Mom's maternal grandmother's
ancestor was a Major in the Fifteenth Alabama that fought against the Twentieth
Maine."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>She turned to Thor. "Your
great-great grandfather might have killed my great-great-great grandfather.&nbsp; Is
it too late to claim wergeld?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Thor's parents had been tense at
first, in case Daria took such matters seriously, but they now relaxed as Thor
asked, "Didn't you say your Aunt Rita was older than your Mother?&nbsp; If so, I
would have to pay that cousin of yours."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Oh, never mind then."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>All four seemed to be more at
ease after that, although the Villars could never be said to have relaxed.&nbsp;
After dinner, Thor's parents cleared the table and shooed the teens out.&nbsp; After
about ten minutes, they could be heard practicing down in the basement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Thor meanwhile had led Daria
upstairs to his bedroom &ndash; he of course left the door open. The master bedroom
was over the front room and was the largest of the three bedrooms &ndash; Thor's was
the back bedroom, twelve by twelve plus a closet.&nbsp; The wall his bedroom shared
with his parents' had book shelves made from thick plywood and cinderblocks.&nbsp;
It was clear that at some point the door to the bedroom had been reversed to
allow for the bookshelves to extend nearly across the whole wall (otherwise the
door would have constantly been hitting the shelves when opened).&nbsp; The shelves
were about a third full of books: mysteries; novels and history in various
languages; and language books and dictionaries in English, Latin, and the
Romance languages.&nbsp; There were about a hundred cds, many of them, like Daria's,
bought used.&nbsp; All of Thor's were 'serious' (from the medieval period through
contemporary), with a few musicals and Gilbert &amp; Sullivan operettas mixed
in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The rest of the room was somewhat
Spartan: a queen-sized bed; a sturdy padded chair; and oddly at first glance, a
vanity-dresser with a straight chair. When Daria looked closely, she saw that
the vanity was actually being used as a desk, with a computer on the left, the
monitor and keyboard in the center, and tv on the right.&nbsp; That also explained
why some of Thor's personal objects (cologne, comb-and-brush set, a dish full
of loose change, etc.) were on the shelves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria sat in the padded chair and
gestured Thor to the bed. "Thank you for inviting me over," she said, "it means
a lot."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria looked Thor in the eye. "The
reason why it means a lot is that, in a sense, yours and John's offers for
dating could be seen as being limited to the fall.&nbsp; I don't know how John feels
about Jane, but I think tonight at least implies that you feel like I do, that
we might want to keep this going."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

the other is up to, now and for the rest of this year," Daria pointed out. "And
you should have a good idea about what I'll likely be doing next summer, and
the places I'm likely to be going to college, and what I'll be majoring in, and
even what I hope to do.&nbsp; How about you?&nbsp; You haven't really said."</span></p>

to how I will end up actually doing that?" Daria shrugged. "In a sense, that
would have been an easier question if this were twenty to eighty years ago. I
would probably have had to try and worm my way into a publishing company as a
reader, and worked my way up to become an editor, while sending my own writing
out to supplement my income.&nbsp; While I would have likely loathed living in a
place like New York, I would have had a two bedroom room apartment, the smaller
one for me and the other a den for my books and writing desk.&nbsp; I would probably
have had a row of house plants on the window sill of the den.&nbsp; Now, if you had
asked a year to three years ago, ideally I'd just have been a writer and I saw
myself having a small place in the woods &ndash; not much larger than the apartment I
just mentioned, except for a larger main room, plus a cellar for storage and
such, with a small herb garden, ideally in a green house."</span></p>

hippie-flashbacks.&nbsp; Starting part-way thought ninth grade, I liked to tease
them, saying I wanted an isolated mountain cabin in Montana.&nbsp; For months, my

fluent in ten languages and competent in I don't know how many more.&nbsp; I have Spanish,

(Lawndale won 36-6.) While Jane spent most of Saturday morning painting, she
stopped when Daria showed up at noon with a light lunch.&nbsp; They then treated
John and Thor to the movies, going to see the newly released director's cut of <i>The

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Daria, I know I'm good," Jane
replied, "but the Rhode Island College of Art and Design is one of the best,
period, and in some ways it may be the most prestigious art and design school
in the US."</span></p>

still Raft, but Bromwell and Ellis are close behind," Daria pointed out. "Ellis
is just north of Providence, and so sort of in-between Boston and Bromwell.&nbsp;
And while Ellis isn't exclusively an art college, they have a very well-known
and respected art department."</span></p>

with such sincerity that Jane was startled.&nbsp; Seeing the enforced lack of
emotion on Daria's face, Jane said nothing, but felt warmed by the fact that
Daria cared for her so much. </span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Since the three Js alternated at
the starting tight end and wide receiver positions (and usually bringing the
plays in from the Coach), Joey's having to miss the home game against
Cumberland High that Saturday, when there was not enough time to alter the game
plan, hurt the offense.&nbsp; With the Lawndale offense spending much less time on
the field and Cumberland having outstanding receivers and a quarterback with an
arm nearly as good as Kevin's, Lawndale's defense was challenged for the first
time.&nbsp; However, Lawndale managed to hold on for a 16-13 victory.&nbsp; It was such a
see-saw battle that even Jane and Jodie paid attention for most of the game.</span></p>

were even more tired than usual, although not actually exhausted.&nbsp; Still, they
were looking forward to that evening.&nbsp; They made their way to Beef-n-Cake,
where Thor, John, and Jane ordered the same meals as they did two weeks
before.&nbsp; Daria also ordered the burger this time, and by unspoken agreement no
one ordered the onion rings.&nbsp; Instead, everyone got large chocolate shakes,
although Thor was the only one to finish his during the meal.&nbsp; He ordered
another to take with him.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The Yanuzzis lived in a different
old section of town than the Villars, this one the original up-scale area
behind down town.&nbsp; The area's proximity to the hospital as well as downtown and
the court house, plus the scale of the mid-to-late Victorian houses, insured a
steady supply of physicians, lawyers, and other upscale professionals in the 125
years since the area had started to be built up.&nbsp; While the better part of the
downtown area had lost nearly all the small traditional shops (butchers,
grocers, small general and department stores, newsstands, etc.), diners, and
the town's original play house and movie theaters, they had been replaced by
some upscale restaurants and clothing stores, and a number of real estate
agents, law offices, etc. before blending into the slightly more down-scale
area the homecoming parade went through on the way towards the high school, and
then, just beyond that, Main Street crossed Degas, where the real down-scale
area started.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The Yanuzzi house was a large late
Victorian set a few streets back from Main Street.&nbsp; Behind it was what had
originally been a two storey stable, later converted into a four stall garage.&nbsp;
The bay which had the stairs going up to the loft (mostly used by the extended
Yanuzzi family to store records), had first been converted into a play area on
the ground floor, but was now divided into a front area which led up the stairs
and a back area which held the large hot tub.&nbsp; There was a small washroom at
the top of the stairs, where Jane and Daria took turns changing into their
suits and flip-flops.</span></p>

slight fractures were healing fast, but she had been told she still needed to
wear the heavy brace most of the time for a few more weeks.&nbsp; She left the brace
upstairs with her clothes, but had exchanged her glasses for her contacts
before leaving the press box that afternoon.</span></p>

looked at Jane, "The guys have been pretty good, but if they're not wearing
anything but a leer, I'm making a break for the pepper spray."</span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The two friends took deep breaths
and went down the stairs.&nbsp; They found the lights in the back area dimmed, but
not excessively so.&nbsp; Both teens were already in the tub.&nbsp; Before Daria could
comment, Thor and then John stood to greet them.&nbsp; Thor's trunks were rather
baggie, and Daria was glad that, while John's suit was tight, it was far from a
Speedo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The room was not large but it was
decently-sized, twelve feet across and fifteen feet deep.&nbsp; The large hot tub was
as long as the twelve-foot wall it was set against, and ten-feet in the other
direction.&nbsp; The boys' clothes were hanging on hooks and there was corked
matting on the floor leading to the steps up to the tub (which was set three
feet above the floor, and was four feet deep with three feet of it water).&nbsp;
There were also a pair of air heaters, with the electronics set safely away
from the tub, and water-proof controls for the tub heater and water jets.&nbsp; The
only other object in the room was a trashcan in one corner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Thor helped Daria into the tub,
and then helped her settle into so that her left arm couldn't knock against
anything.&nbsp; The water was warm, and John set the jets to a soothing speed.&nbsp; The
quartet snuggled into couples, and spent the first ten minutes happily holding
each other and working on their milkshakes.&nbsp; When they were finished, John got
out and tossed the empty cups into the trash.&nbsp; Then he stood next to the
lighting controls and just looked at Daria, knowing that she would set the
pace.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>When they did, Daria realized
that the frosted triple-paned window behind them still let in a fair amount of
ambient light, and that there was a small pane of similarly frosted glass in
the door leading to the other room.&nbsp; Between the two, it was dark enough to
ignore what the other couple was doing, but there was enough light to see what
you wanted to see.</span></p>
