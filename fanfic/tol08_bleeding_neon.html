about them both.&nbsp; If John were a girl, I'd call him flighty when he comes to
dating, and Thor was far more serious about Cindy than she ever was over him.&nbsp;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"An idea for you," Daria replied.
"Nothing more, and if you like the general idea but not the specifics, it

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Thor looked interested, so Daria
explained. "There is an interdisciplinary major called 'European Studies.' It's
not offered at many places, and at most of them, it seems to be a mixture of
history, literature, and either economics or sociology.&nbsp; At a few, it's
history, economics, and sociology.&nbsp; But at Ellis, it's history, literature, and
art history, with a music option." Thor looked more interested.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria nodded. "What makes Ellis'
program different from any other place I've seen is that you have to apply through
the art or music programs, plus you need at least a six hundred in the SAT
history area and display competency in a major European language, which they
define as French, German, or Russian, plus any other modern European language,
in addition to English of course.&nbsp; With the music option, you need to play at
least basic-level piano, which you said you do."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Good enough to meet a music
school's general requirement, but not nearly well enough to major in it," Thor
agreed. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"So, you'd only take two
semesters of musicology, two of theory, and two of piano instead of the full music
major, and they said acceptable levels at any other instrument would be a
plus.&nbsp; In addition, Ellis does play Division One football, although I admit
their record for the last ten years isn't very good."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"No winning seasons," Daria
admitted. "Fifty-one and sixty-nine.&nbsp; They have had three six and six seasons,
including last year."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>That Friday morning, Ms Li was
surprised to find Daria Morgendorffer, dressed in her old outfit and calmly
waiting to see her before homeroom. "And what can I do you, Ms Morgendorffer?"
Li asked as Daria entered and then sat across from her.</span></p>

student council and PTA," Daria said flatly, "and the regulations of both as
filed with the County Superintendent's Office, students are allowed to petition
the principal for changes, and those petitions may also be filed with the PTA,
the Superintendent's Office, and the District and County School Boards for
action should the principal fail to act in a timely manner.&nbsp; Therefore, to
start, and hopefully end the process, I have two petitions, and I also have a
suggestion."</span></p>

more curious than upset. 'Did she mention the other authorities as a threat, or

one quarter of the signatures of the active students to be considered," Daria
stated. "There are currently twelve-hundred and fifteen students listed as
active as of Tuesday.&nbsp; The first petition has three hundred and twelve
authentic signatures, the other three hundred and forty-eight."</span></p>

a fruit juice machine for the cafeteria.&nbsp; Considering the state-mandated
nutrition guidelines, Lawndale was bordering on a violation because the healthy
juice had to be purchased separately.&nbsp; Not having the option at all could cost
us some of the subsidized food from the state &ndash; which is currently used primarily
to feed the poorer athletes full breakfasts."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"The second would be more
difficult to implement," Daria stated. "Still, it is a petition to change one
of the soda machines in the cafeteria to a generic machine, in the older style,
with choices of root beer, lemon lime, and orange sodas and their diet
equivalents." This had been a concession to the Fashion Club to a degree, who
wanted variety in their diet soda. &nbsp;In return, however, they (or rather Quinn
and Stacy) had gathered most of the signatures for both petitions. &nbsp;Daria went
on before Ms Li could take a breath, "At first glance, the second could be seen
as violating the original contract you had with the Ultra Cola distributers,
however, that part of the school's agreement is with those two distributors,
Hamm's of Oakwood and Darcy's of Riverdale, not Ultra Cola itself, although
they agreed to that contract as part of their contract with the school, at
least according to the contracts on the public record..&nbsp; Hamm's carries the
proper fruit juices, and Darcy's also supplies generic sodas, including those
flavors.&nbsp; Therefore, both could supply those machines and the products,
allowing the school to stay within the contracts." Daria slipped two of the
four folders she had over to Ms Li.</span></p>

couldn't lose, and so was not going to argue. "And the other matter?" While

school in Texas did, where Blast Cola ended up pressuring them into changing
the school colors to their horrid shades of neon red and purple and even using
so-called 'teaching aids' which nearly caused the state to come in and take

of the game to catch his breath.&nbsp; Thor didn't realize it, but he had never
played the game at 100 percent &ndash; he had always held back just a bit, in part to
protect his left hand from injury, and in part because he was so large and
strong he was afraid of hurting someone.</span></p>

throw the guard off without actually having to put his hands on the player.&nbsp;

send its entire band to games at CCC.&nbsp; Instead, a 'pep band' went, consisting
of three large percussionists in charge of an old bass drum (but each of them had
a heavy wooden bass drum stick, which was over half an inch thick in the shaft
and with a rounded head that also made it a potential cosh) and seven

afternoon together just walking the local malls and going out to dinner.&nbsp; Daria

apparently not known, and Ms Li had forgotten to mention, that the school ran a
cable access channel for the both the school district and the local cable
company.&nbsp; Regular tv ads were not allowed, but 'sponsored by' announcements were
allowed, as were, in some circumstances, streaming ads along the bottom of the
screen.&nbsp; Altogether, between mid-October and the end of summer of 2001 (for Ms
Li and Jake had the deal worked out before noon that Friday), Daria's ideas
would generate over $130,000 worth of total business for Morgendorffer
Consulting (including the commission from Ultra Cola for additional costs for
tv sponsorship).&nbsp; Granted, of that money $54,000 went to the high school and
another $22,500 went to the school district (which also made Ms Li look good),
and $28,200 went for various production costs, etc., plus $3,000 went to
Lawndale Law, but that still would leave Jake with just over $30,000 of profit
for about 15 hours worth of work on his part.&nbsp; This would be only a small part
of his bottom line, but it was certainly by far his best hourly earnings.&nbsp; Jake
would add ten percent of that into Daria's college fund.</span></p>

renegotiate. (Ultra Cola in turn would seize most of the money it owed Lamm in

even split of $3,000 each for Morgendorffer Consulting and Lawndale Law.</span></p>
