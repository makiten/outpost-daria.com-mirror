<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Quinn Morgendorffer was a confused
teen.&nbsp; Granted, her sister might have claimed, especially before the previous
summer, that Quinn was always confused, but this was a level of confusion Quinn
was very uncomfortable with.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>She had had some insights into
her confusion, and Daria had supplied a few more over the previous weeks, but
Quinn just had not been able to deal with her changing life.&nbsp; Therefore, she
had saved up her money and so the morning after the Lawndale-CCC football game
she presented herself at the most complete day spa in the area.&nbsp; She would be
exfoliated, depilatoried, waxed, massaged, sponged, and given both a pedicure
and a manicure.&nbsp; As her body was taken care of, she hoped to let her mind drift
off and think about where she was in life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Whatever dissatisfactions Quinn
had had the previous year, she had not been confused about herself.&nbsp; Of course,
she had also had no real thoughts about the future then, either.&nbsp; Where had the
changes started?&nbsp; In part, it had started when her sister had come to her to
help Jane do her hair the previous spring.&nbsp; Jane had only kept the change for a
month or so, but the activity seemed to have broken down some of the barriers
between the sisters.&nbsp; Daria's willingness to change her look for writing camp,
coupled with Quinn's desire to get into Pepperhill even if it meant studying
over the summer, had also signaled that things were changing within each
sister, so Quinn realized that it might also show that things would have to
change between herself and her sister as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Quinn also acknowledged that the
mere fact that she openly acknowledged Daria as her sister marked a real
change.&nbsp; Both she and Sandi had been a little surprised when no one else was at
all surprised by the admission.&nbsp; Even Tiffany had rolled her eyes at the
thought that anyone would have believed otherwise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The summer without Daria had
actually been a little lonely; Quinn had found she wanted to talk with Daria. &nbsp;Her
insights, while usually delivered with considerable sarcasm, had often been helpful
&ndash; something she only fully acknowledged the previous August when she had
watched the skits presented at Ashfield. &nbsp;The e-mails they had exchanged over
the summer, sporadically at first and then almost daily, was more conversation
than the sisters had ever shared before.&nbsp; Even now, the pair probably exchanged
more news via e-mail than in person.&nbsp; It was odd, but considering the level of
hostilities they had had before, it was likely a good thing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Quinn remembered the video of
Daria's third birthday, when she had blown out Daria's candles and the photo of
Daria wrestling her to the ground.&nbsp; Those moments had pretty much defined their
relationship until the announcement had come they were moving from Highland.&nbsp;
Daria had loathed Highland even more than Quinn had, but she had established a
place there.&nbsp; From then on, especially when they had arrived in Lawndale and
Quinn had become the queen of the freshman year and one of the most popular
girls in the school while Daria had been stuck in self-esteem class, she felt
she had usually had the upper hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Not always, naturally, but in her
opinion, often.&nbsp; Of course, over most of the now two-plus years since the move,
Quinn had largely been living a fun life, while Daria had been struggling with
her inner demons on the one hand and preparing herself for her preferred career
on the other.&nbsp; Granted, Daria had in part lucked into that summer writing camp
because of Jane, but her previous work had gotten her accepted and her work
once she got there seemed to have started both a college career and a
professional one, although the second was still problematic.&nbsp; Daria had always
worked hard at school work and her writing and nothing else, preferring to
watch tv, listen to music, and play computer games or surf on-line.&nbsp; Now Daria
had gained focus, which was a bit disconcerting to Quinn, and both disturbing
and a source of comfort for their mother.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Quinn had never worked hard at
anything, other than to look good and to juggle dates, until that summer.&nbsp; She
couldn't say she had enjoyed the experience, but she could see its value.&nbsp;
Having a crush on her tutor had not helped, but she thought she was over it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>One part of her problem was,
frankly, what would she do now?&nbsp; She had continued to work on her school work,
enduring Sandi's occasional nasty sarcasm and Tiffany's blank disapproval, but
she felt confident that when the mid-trimester grades arrived this upcoming
week she would have that B/B- average she needed.&nbsp; Quinn had researched all the
California schools, and Pepperhill was for her, and she would finally be a
California Girl, like she had always dreamed of being.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Still, that wasn't enough.&nbsp; David
had called her on it, and she knew it.&nbsp; She had even talked the problem over
with Daria &ndash; what would she do in college, and after?&nbsp; Super model/actress was
still a dream, but she knew in her heart that she was not about to study
theater.&nbsp; That little foray into acting in the Chaucer skit had cured her of
any desire to be a stage actress, although part of her still dreamed of being a
movie/tv actress.&nbsp; The Fashion Club and a few other girls did some amateur
modeling for Cashman's and a few of the other trendier clothing stores, but only
a few of the photos circulated outside of the local malls. &nbsp;Quinn knew that
some of the photos in the local ads were amateurs from other areas, even other
states &ndash; if she was going to be discovered, she would have been picked up by
now.&nbsp; Maybe, if she had won that modeling contract . . . well, too late for
those regrets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Worried, Quinn had done something
several weeks before she never would have thought of doing.&nbsp; She went to Daria
for advice on a level she could never have imagined. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>It had been the night Daria and
her friends had done the presentation at the law office.&nbsp; Quinn was impressed
by their work, and also how quickly Daria had deduced the trap their mother had
accidentally set and overcome it.&nbsp; In previous years, Daria would have been
angry, and some of that wrath would have spilled over onto Quinn.&nbsp; Instead,
Daria had just incorporated Quinn into the presentation.&nbsp; That had pleased
Quinn, and led her to Daria's room that evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Quinn knew she did not need either
her mother's pep talk or her 'you can be anything you want to be' talk &ndash; she knew
she needed some real guidance.&nbsp; Her friends could not provide it, her parents
would not, and Ms Li cared more for security and psych counseling than much
general guidance counseling &ndash; that would be available for her only starting the
next spring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>And so Daria had agreed that
night to give up part of Labor Day to help her sister.&nbsp; She had been a little
sarcastic, but really, compared to how they had usually spoken to each other,
Daria was actually much more supportive than sarcastic, and not in any way
nasty.&nbsp; Quinn knew that Daria had even been suffering from a terrible tension
headache that Monday morning, but still took the entire afternoon to help her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>In fact, Quinn had decided to her
surprise that Daria had actually been happy to help her, and most of the
sarcasm was habit and the rest likely just her covering up how much she actually
wanted to help Quinn.&nbsp; They had gone through the curriculum and majors at
Pepperhill.&nbsp; Quinn agreed to look more at the public relations/advertizing,
telecommunications, business, and film studies programs as possible majors, as
well as the production/design area of the theater/film program. While Quinn did
not have Jane's raw artistic talent, both Quinn and Daria could draw moderately
well, and Quinn did have a good eye for color and design.&nbsp; The University also
allowed students to design their own majors, and Daria had agreed to help there
if things went in that direction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>To Quinn's surprise, Daria did
not question her desire to go to the greater Los Angeles area.&nbsp; When Quinn
mentioned it, Daria had replied, "Who am I to question that?&nbsp; With the
exception of two last line safeties, the four places I'm aiming for are all in
New England."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>That discussion, which at least
gave Quinn some direction for her future, had taken care of part of the
problem.&nbsp; Even that was not fully settled, as Quinn was still very undecided
about any possible career path.&nbsp; Talking with a number of people in her grade,
however, made Quinn realize that she was well ahead of all of them, except the
few who knew they would be going into their families' businesses and some who
were fairly sure they knew which fields they were going to try for.&nbsp; In this
respect, Quinn decided, being just a bit ahead of the game was probably
alright.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>There was something, or perhaps
some related somethings, niggling at the back of Quinn's brain, and that was
what she was hoping would pop out at the day spa.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Considering her age and
popularity, it was not surprising that Quinn's mind first turned to her social
life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>She knew serial dating was
largely silly, but it was fun and that was how the game was played in and
around Lawndale.&nbsp; If the popularity game had involved promenading up and down a
town square, or being driven around on a motorcycle or in a hay wagon while
trying to look better than the other girls, or even competitive dancing in
music halls, she would have been just as happy doing any of those.&nbsp; Quinn was competitive,
and wanted to show her peers that she was, in fact, peerless.&nbsp; She had taken a
trio of semi-popular if attractive freshmen &ndash; a self-centered bitch, a cute but
spineless follower, and a drone &ndash; and dragged them to near the top of the
popularity ranks.&nbsp; By spreading out the attention a little, it just highlighted
her own success while spreading out the jealousy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>It helped Quinn that she liked
Stacy and could tolerate Tiffany.&nbsp; Her relationship with Sandi was more
complicated.&nbsp; She would genuinely like to spend more time with Sandi and Stacy
(and if need be Tiffany) just being friends.&nbsp; If only Sandi could give in just
a bit on her inner-bitch. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Quinn frowned, which drew a mild
reprimand from the woman applying the facial mud.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>'Why did I drift away from boys
and dating?' Quinn wondered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Part of Quinn's need to dominate
the boys around her was fear &ndash; Upchuck was not the only male at Lawndale who
was after whatever he could claim.&nbsp; Granted, the teen pregnancy rate at
Lawndale High was low &ndash; about a fifth of what Highland High's had been.&nbsp; At
least two of Quinn's eighth grade classmates had given birth by the end of that
school year, and there had been a number of her fellow ninth graders who were
at various stages of pregnancy at the start of that next year.&nbsp; Watching what
some of them had had to go through struck fear into Quinn, as had the near-molestation
in the hallway that Daria had stopped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>If there was one thing each
female member of the Morgendorffer household strove for, it was self-control
and refusing control over themselves by others, even if each expressed it very
differently.&nbsp; For Quinn, it was still a source of inner embarrassment that she
could be startled into slightly over-the-top reactions when boys got too close
or became too grabby.&nbsp; Still, she was interested in boys, not girls, no matter
what rumors were spread about the Fashion Club in general and her in
particular.&nbsp; There were, in fact, a few quiet, self-assured (and discreet) guys
who could tell wonderful things about the glories of Quinn's nude body and the
softness of Quinn's hands.&nbsp; However, since they were discreet, willing to let Quinn
take full control, and moderately intelligent, they kept those secrets to
themselves, never suspecting there were others in on the secret.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Quinn knew these relationships,
and the stunted ones she had with other guys, would not be healthy if they were
what she really wanted over the long-term.&nbsp; For now, however, they fulfilled
her current needs in different ways.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>So no, it wasn't her relationship
with boys that was bothering her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Nor was it fashion.&nbsp; That was as
major a preoccupation to her as literature and any other three subjects were to
her sister.&nbsp; One idea planted into Quinn's head by Daria was becoming a fashion
buyer for major store chains.&nbsp; The basic idea had some appeal, although both
sisters realized the problems of gaining such employment.&nbsp; Still, it was a job
Quinn could actually see herself doing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>In addition, although Helen
downplayed both her daughters' success in that area when they had been in
middle school, both showed they could handle a needle and thread in 'Home Ec.'&nbsp;
'Fashion historian' did not interest Quinn in the slightest, although the field
held some of the same morbid interest to her as Daria's interest in objects
like skull-crushers and skull replicas even though she no longer entertained
thoughts of becoming a physical anthropologist or physician.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Maintaining and restoring old
clothes? A little 'dusty' for a career, Quinn thought, but the
production/design areas of Pepperhill's theater and communications department
included courses in that area, and so Quinn had not ruled it out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>But no, fashion was not Quinn's
problem &ndash; well, it was an all consuming interest which could lead to problems,
but she decided it was not the problem she was trying to understand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>That brought Quinn's attention
back to the Fashion Club.&nbsp; However, by then Quinn was at the waxing stage, and
having hair ripped from a person's intimate area does tend to make the
attention wander off other subjects.&nbsp; It wouldn't be until after enjoying a
crisp salad and mineral water for lunch and then tucked into a sauna for half
an hour that Quinn could return to thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>It wasn't the Fashion Club that
was the problem, it was that the Fashion Club provided everything Quinn wanted
and needed except one thing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Quinn realized that she wanted,
perhaps even needed, a real friend; a friend like Jane was with Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Accidents happen at any school.&nbsp;
However, in light of what had previously happened to Daria and Joey, what
happened the Tuesday after the Lawndale-CCC game was suspicious to say the
least.&nbsp; It was during the exchange of classes before the penultimate class
period.&nbsp; The general classroom buildings had multiple storeys and, while all
the entrances and the major intersections all had cameras, the main stairs did
not, although the side stairwells did.&nbsp; One group of students tumbled down from
the top of the stairs.&nbsp; Because the stairs were so crowded, no one fell more
than three actual steps.&nbsp; No one broke anything, but there was a fair amount of
bruising on at least eight different students, including the Fashion Club.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Ms Li was uncertain how Daria had
learned of the incident, let alone how she had gotten permission to be absent
from class.&nbsp; The pass in her hand, however, did show she had that permission.&nbsp;
Ms Li was more curious than ever about the enigmatic and still somewhat
anti-social teen, and so said nothing, just stepping back and observing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>In short order, Daria had quieted
the whining of the students, allowing the nurse to finish checking them for
damage and then she had them recreate the incident (a security officer
scribbled frantic notes so he could write out an action report).&nbsp; It became
clear that the first person to go down the stairs was Tiffany, who was more
confused than usual.&nbsp; She was fairly certain she had not been pushed or even
nudged, but nothing beyond that. "It was just so dizzying," was her drawled,
repeated comment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria had just sighed, borrowed a
pocket mirror from Quinn, sat Tiffany in a shadowed corner, and used the mirror
to flash light in Tiffany's direction.&nbsp; In less than a minute, Daria had
hypnotized not only Tiffany, but everyone in the room but the nurse, Ms Li, and
herself.</span></p>

bad I can't leave them this way," was Daria's only muttered comment before
waking everyone but Tiffany quietly up.&nbsp; She made certain to wake Quinn up
before she could start trying to channel Cleopatra again.</span></p>

only much more coherent under hypnoses, she also spoke in a normal voice.&nbsp;
Still, in the end it could not be absolutely certain if she had slipped,
tripped herself, or was tripped.&nbsp; While the incident report was given to the
police, it was generally considered an accident.</span></p>

three sycophants behind him, two from Quinn's year and a sophomore. &nbsp;&nbsp;A quick
glance confirmed her knowledge: they were all in camera shot of one of the
security cameras and the quartet of boys would also be in another. "What do you
want, pretty boy?" Daria snapped, not in the mood for her usual defter verbal
attacks.</span></p>

can manage to get."</span></p>

Feldman lunging at Daria &ndash; and her knee connecting perfectly with his crotch,
followed by her boot heel crunching his foot, breaking four bones.&nbsp; His three

the pepper spray made direct hits to their eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

teen, who had grabbed Quinn. "If you let her go and run, I won't cripple you
for life," Daria growled, the canister pointed directly at his eyes.&nbsp; The teen
raised his hands off of Quinn's upper arms and backed off, hands still in the air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>It took another fifteen minutes
to sort things out at the school, including sending three of the boys off to
the emergency room under police escort.&nbsp; The four boys and Daria would be
suspended for at least the next day, while the implications were sorted out.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>While the Feldmans would complain
and threaten the next day, they could not dispute the security cameras, which
clearly showed the four boys approaching the Morgendorffer sisters in the
uncrowded hallway and speaking first.&nbsp; It was also clear that Daria had acted
only after the clear attack by Skyler and the attacking motions of the other
boys.&nbsp; Those circumstances, plus the fact that Daria had not continued to
attack them while the boys were incapacitated or used the pepper spray on the
boy who had grabbed Quinn as he had backed off, pretty much spiked any
accusations of overkill.&nbsp; Daria's one day suspension would be commuted to an
excused absence in her records, and her bear spray returned.&nbsp; Skylar, who had
already been expelled from three of the area's private schools for sexual
harassment, was now expelled from Lawndale as well, and none of the other
county schools would touch him, not even neighboring CCC.&nbsp; The other three boys
would be transferred to three different school districts within the county,
effective the following Monday, with their record showing three days of
suspension for harassment.&nbsp; Those three's parents were not happy with them, and
the three, to a large degree, straightened out their act over time.</span></p>

his son, "What the hell do I do with you now?" Jake suggested "Buxton Ridge
Military Academy." Daria felt this was a good solution, even if she would never
learn that Skylar would have a much more traumatic time there than Jake ever
had.</span></p>

unhappy Helen came and escorted her husband and two daughters home that
Tuesday. (Jake was far too upset to be trusted even driving to the school, so
Helen had picked him up.) Fortunately, Helen had held her tongue as Quinn's
avalanche of explanations rolled over her in the car, twice.&nbsp; After that second
time, she had Daria explain.</span></p>

responded. "I need to see that Ms Li makes the surveillance tapes available."&nbsp;
Ms Li, who was for the moment very pleased with the oft-recalcitrant Daria
because of the revenue her ideas and work were bringing in, would be happy to
supply copies of the tapes to all concerned.&nbsp; Despite the many times Ms Li had
had her run-ins with the quartet of Morgendorffers, the Feldmans were far more
trouble.</span></p>
