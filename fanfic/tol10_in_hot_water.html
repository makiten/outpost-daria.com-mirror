streaks that Jane and I really don't have, even if Daria tries very hard to
hide it." He, Theo, and Jane all thought that Daria was likely the most
sensuous, although she kept that even more hidden that her romantic streak. "I
don't think they're any more in love than Jane and I are, but I think the idea
that they might really fall for each other both excited and worries them a
bit.&nbsp; If anything, I think Thor is a bit more, well, smitten, than Daria."</span></p>

moderate necking and light petting when alone in Thor's truck, and they really
had no place else to make out, and John and Jane had gone only slightly further
in his car.&nbsp; The school was really impossible &ndash; the only place would have been
the store room Jane painted in, and she was not about to risk that space.&nbsp; The
Morgendorffer house was out, as was the Lanes', since Jane's Mom was not only
still in town but likely to be in the house in the evenings.&nbsp; John's mom had
long before ruled the actual house out of bounds, which was a shame,

And yes, I have enjoyed those experiences, but at the same time, part of me has
been screaming over being so exposed.&nbsp; That was my limit, and right now it
still is.&nbsp; The mere thought of as much intimacy as Jane will experience
tonight, never mind the ultimate physical intimacy it may someday lead to, makes
me want to run away and throw up.&nbsp; If I thought you'd push even a little bit, I
probably would have done just that."</span></p>

manner Jane was that evening.&nbsp; Much more difficult was admitting to herself she
did not want to retreat, either.&nbsp; The question was, could she find some other action

and stand in the bath tub."</span></p>

that will result in a mess, the bath tub seems the best place for it.&nbsp; You can
then shower, and while you do that, I will wash up at the same time.&nbsp; I will
see you tomorrow night after six.&nbsp; Tell Jane I'll talk with her after school as
well.&nbsp; I don't want to talk about tonight before then, so I'll be skipping the

forehead. "You can do this, Morgendorffer," she muttered. "If you can't be
normal, you can at least pretend.&nbsp; You know from the girls talking in the locker
room this is a fairly common activity for couples, even some casual couples, so
no one other than Mom and Dad would look down at me for doing it in the
unlikely event anyone beyond Jane and John learn of it.&nbsp; And this will not be
embarrassing . . . well, that embarrassing . . . it will be educational.&nbsp; Theo
will have a good time, and with my being in control, I might actually like it .

afternoon.&nbsp; When Thor had said Daria had left (without going into any
explanations on what the pair had done, or not done), she had quickly realized
that she had made several errors.&nbsp; The question now would be what would Daria
do in response?&nbsp; She had been polite but distant all day, and Jane did not know
how to interpret that.</span></p>

the hormone storms which were causing the rash, but after a few times a week
for a few weeks that was taken care of and after that, maybe once every two or
three weeks at most until last summer.&nbsp; It's a level of giving up control on

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

that. "That's where young teen girls are brought to a gathering of a few older
girls and lots of guys.&nbsp; The popular older girls then pressure the younger ones
into performing oral sex on one or more random boys in order to join their
popular group.&nbsp; Of course, the girls are mostly popular because they are both attractive
and compliant, at least within the context of the 'party.'&nbsp; They had them at
Highland, too.&nbsp; Even I was invited, although I had enough sense to say no, and
by the time Quinn was considered in High School those girls were too
intimidated by Quinn's natural popularity and my reputation to try it with her."</span></p>

back at the start of ninth grade," Jane said quietly. "I went to one and then
refused to do it.&nbsp; That's why I was rejected by the 'popular girls' &ndash; even the ones
who didn't participate.&nbsp; I had been judged and placed in a category; by going
to that first party and then refusing to go along, refusing to know my place, I
was rejected even by the girls who would never have gone to such a party." Jane's
mouth twisted into a hurt smile. "By the time they were through trashing me, I
actually probably did need the first two self-esteem classes."</span></p>

because Lawndale defeated Middlebury last night, twenty-one to seventeen."&nbsp; She
paused for a second, and added, "Rah." Middlebury was a powerful team outside
Lawndale's usual schedule and, in fact, the state runner-up the year before.&nbsp;
Lawndale's beating the undefeated Middlebury team would be catching the
attention of the state's sports writers as the debate on which teams might be
eligible for the state championships heated up.</span></p>
