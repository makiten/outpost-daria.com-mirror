style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"You apparently have very high
standards, and are very protective of your friends," Amy pointed out, "and
while you have periods of laziness that Helen never had, you are pretty driven
academically in every area.&nbsp; That's all a lot more like Helen than me.&nbsp; Oh, don't
get me wrong, in many areas I was pretty driven academically as well." She
thought a moment, and said, "Helen was driven to succeed at everything in
school, in part trying to get attention away from Rita and in part because that's
just part of her; I was driven in some subjects, especially in a lot of
subjects that aren't taught in high school. &nbsp;In some regular courses, I got low
B's or even C's. &nbsp;You're sort of in-between, because Helen was also a joiner
and I was in the orchestra and that was it."</span></p>

low-level involvement bothers her, never mind my near-total dismissal of the

to prove I could have done it if I really had wanted to."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Now that sounds like me.&nbsp; Anyway,
I told you about going to the drive-in to make out at fifteen, but I never went

not only entered by senior year of high school a virgin I left the same way,
and was technically one until ten years later.&nbsp; I had some of the same intimacy
issues you told me you're having."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I guess I'm about fifty-fifty in
my interests," Amy said. "I met a nice guy when I had a two year gig at Tulane
right after I got the doctorate.&nbsp; We had a great time, but then I got the job
in New Jersey, and he got a job in Michigan, and we weren't interested in compromising
or having that long a distance relationship."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Amy looked at Daria. "My response
to your situation last Tuesday night when I was your age would have been much
the same, if I hadn't run screaming from the house altogether.&nbsp; In fact,
something similar happened at a party the summer after I graduated high school,
and while I didn't run screaming, I did literally run.&nbsp; I couldn't even think
of kissing a guy for about seven years."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

quietly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I had always taken notice, and
did a little exploration &ndash; we all pretended it was 'practice kissing' for being
with boys back in junior high and into high school, although that had totally
stopped by the time we started eleventh grade.&nbsp; I couldn't take that final step
for a while, that is date and then much later make love, until I was a
sophomore at UVA and was with a woman I trusted and was attracted to.&nbsp; We
stayed a couple until we went off to different graduate schools.&nbsp; Staying
together even that long sort of surprised us, because we knew that while we
liked each other, we weren't life partners."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Tom and Jane together," Daria
admitted. "Then when I broke down confessing what Tom had done, Jane hugged and
kissed me.&nbsp; All summer, I fantasized about Jane, although that's receded
somewhat since I started dating Theo." She looked at her aunt. "Jane is more
sexual and much more tactile than I am, although maybe less sensual, and certainly
much more open, at least with me . . . although she's more interested in boys
and less interested in girls than I am.&nbsp;&nbsp; I get more turned on by guys than
girls &ndash; in fact Jane is the only girl I'm attracted to in that way &ndash; there's
just something about Jane. . . ."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"However you feel is fine," Amy
assured her niece. "Aunt Eleanor did have a life partner, a fact checker for <i>Time</i>
magazine who died about eight years before Eleanor did.&nbsp; She told me she couldn't
accept that physical side of a relationship herself until she was over thirty.&nbsp;
I was twenty.&nbsp; You're ahead of our intimacy curve at least.&nbsp; If it doesn't feel
right with Theo, you'll find someone when the time is right.&nbsp; It might be Jane,
it might be another person. &nbsp;Don't let that bother you, especially if you can
stay friends with Jane.&nbsp; The kind of friendship you've told me about over the
last year is something precious."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Amy didn't directly answer. "Aunt
Eleanor had kept up on the family news better than I had.&nbsp; Now I know what I
said to you at the wedding, but I of course knew you were still in high
school.&nbsp; I would have tried to meet with you after you graduated, if the
wedding hadn't come up." Amy almost managed a smile. "Aunt Eleanor told me not
to be an overly proud bitch and go.&nbsp; She was worried about the pressures Helen
was putting on you, and knew she couldn't do anything about it.&nbsp; I started
being a pen-pal with Aunt Eleanor when I was fourteen.&nbsp; I needed to try and do
the same with you again." Amy looked at Daria with surprisingly sad eyes, which
startled the younger woman. "I don't know if you remember, but I helped you
guys move to Highland the summer before you started kindergarten."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"But because I was the quiet one,
the one she could trust not to wander off, the one who wouldn't make a scene,"
Daria said in a disgusted voice. "I would never scream for candy in a grocery
store, or because someone wasn't paying attention to me.&nbsp; I never ran around
like I was on a sugar high, just to claim attention."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

ruining the books with crayons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

spent more on you than Quinn.&nbsp; Your mother and I got into a huge argument that
next spring, after I sent something to Quinn that didn't match her
expectations, based on what I had spent on you.&nbsp; She had scolded me after
Christmas, but when I didn't make up for it, well, we said some nasty things to
each other, especially her to me about my life style and the possibilities of
my corrupting or stealing you.&nbsp; Since after that, I always scrupulously adhered
to her spending instructions, she forgave me, but I hadn't forgiven her until
recently.&nbsp; I couldn't actually speak directly to her for about five years,

very rational person, except when it comes to dealing with Mother and my

do.&nbsp; It's a bit humbling, actually." She looked at Daria. "You're creating your
own life, younger than I did, and possibly better as well.&nbsp; Your mother, for
all her faults, not only loves you but cares about you and will help you in
most ways.&nbsp; I love and care, too, Daria.&nbsp; I realized it was long past time for
me to tell you that outright instead of hording up my resentments &ndash; that wasn't
doing you any good.&nbsp; So, I needed to get past my own demons and pride,
especially those concerning Helen, and see if I could still be part of your
life, even though I don't deserve to be." Amy gave Daria a twisted smile. "Not
exactly something to be said in e-mail or over the phone."</span></p>

that's also probably not that unusual," Daria pointed out. "There were lots of
things that bothered me, but just discussing Mom, and Dad for that matter, two
things stood out.&nbsp; One was the huge discrepancy I thought existed between the
amount they spent on me and how much they pissed away on any of Quinn's
littlest wishes." Daria snorted. "It still bugs me that she's gotten nearly
anything she's wanted, well, so long as any individual item stays under two
hundred dollars or so these days, while my requests were and are usually
ignored.&nbsp; I thought the ratio was about seven or even eight to one in her
favor.&nbsp; It turns out, however, that a lot of the time when they spend on Quinn
they put an equal amount in my college fund.&nbsp; I would be willing to bet the
ration still favors Quinn at least two to one, maybe even three." In that,
Daria was being a trifle unfair, but the ratio still favored Quinn well over
1.5 to 1.&nbsp; "Still, the fact they let me think that the ratio was that bad shows
how they ignore my feelings."</span></p>

problem or caused a problem, and I admit I probably had and caused more of both
than Quinn outside of money, they were pretty good at trying to deal with it,
for both of us," Daria admitted. For some reason, an image of a large box,
decorated with crayons to look like a house, popped in and out of Daria mind. "But
when it came to really knowing what we wanted or needed on the more personal
level?&nbsp; Somehow, whenever the term 'fair' came up, it was to explain why things
had to favor Quinn.&nbsp; They wanted to send us to some stupid summer camp? Could I
please go to science camp?&nbsp; No, it wouldn't be fair for Quinn to go to a
regular camp and me to go to science camp.&nbsp; Could we go see a cave or a
dinosaur site or even a museum?&nbsp; No, Daria; Quinn would be bored, that wouldn't
be fair." Daria's voice was now imitating Helen too well, although there was a
nasty undercurrent to part of what she said. "I know, Sweetie!&nbsp; Yes, we're
going to the lake, but you can't go swimming because Quinn hasn't learned yet.&nbsp;
That wouldn't be fair!&nbsp; Oh Daria, we just went to the library a few days ago,
Quinn doesn't need to get more books; you need to read more slowly.&nbsp; Don't yell
at your sister for throwing your book in the lake, Daria, you shouldn't have
brought a library book to the lake.&nbsp; Oh, Daria, get on the kiddy ride, you'll
look cute with Quinn!&nbsp; Oh, Daria, be more careful around Quinn, you got her ice
cream all over you.&nbsp; Yes, Quinn, we'll get you another.&nbsp; No, Daria, you shouldn't
have dropped yours.&nbsp; Daria, if you're going to frown, get out of the picture.&nbsp;
No, Daria. . . ." </span></p>

took a deep breath and went on, "If I was yelling, I'd be just like Dad." She
looked at Amy, who looked stricken. "The writing camp last summer was the first
thing I really wanted that I got on my own without Quinn getting something
equal or better in return, while Quinn got both attention and material goods
while Mom and Dad added quietly to my college fund out of guilt as well as affection.&nbsp;
Unlike Mom and Aunt Rita with each other, and maybe you with them, I don't
blame Quinn so much.&nbsp; That's probably because, one on one, I usually had the
advantage, if only because I'm older.&nbsp; And, since last spring, Quinn has been
making an effort to make up for some of that behavior, and I've been trying to
do that as well a bit longer."</span></p>

being an independent pain in the butt.&nbsp; One on one, he has as often been at
least as supportive as he's been totally clueless at other times, but I can
forgive him going along, considering he was a victim of real abuse as a child.&nbsp;
As for Mom herself?" Daria shrugged. "Other than her favoring Quinn too much,
which of course really means at least partially not favoring me enough, which
shows part of this is just jealousy, on the whole, she's done a credible job.&nbsp;
She's messed up, sometimes very badly, but then, if I do ever do have kids, I'll
mess up, too, just hopefully in different ways."</span></p>

for four-four, two-two, and three-four time.&nbsp; I can assure you, Mystic Spiral
will not be playing anything like a traditional waltz, minuet, fox trot, or
tango, but we can dance to about two-thirds of their songs that way.&nbsp; So, first
up, who here can waltz?"</span></p>

Daria and Jessica (it turned out that she had also endured a year of dance
lessons) therefore demonstrated, with Quinn and Daria dancing the male parts.&nbsp;
The others quickly picked up the basic steps after about forty-five minutes.&nbsp;
The same six knew some other basic steps for the various meters, and after a
fifteen minute rest, spent the next hour learning them.&nbsp; After another short
break, Daria played some Mystic Spiral songs; those were harder to dance to
than the older music, but they managed it.</span></p>

very fast swing-era dance, which can get very physical and complicated.&nbsp; I
still don't know if I landed wrong because of something I did or what my
partner did, or both, but I did, and then I tripped, and took out four other
dancers, one of whom slid into the boom box we were dancing to and kicked it

angled the car, and then turned off the car but not the lights.&nbsp; That put the
foot at least a bit in the light.&nbsp; She reached across Jane and unlocked the
glove compartment, pulling out a small flashlight.&nbsp; This didn't work by
batteries, but by squeezing a lever.</span></p>

eyes for a few moments and listened.&nbsp; She could hear the rustle of the leaves
in the trees and on the ground as well as Jane's receding steps.&nbsp; Then she
could hear the shallow breathing of the girl she could now see was naked from
the waist down, with a hoodie, a shirt, and an undershirt pushed up high under
her arms.&nbsp; She also had a sock on the other foot.</span></p>

moving some distance away through the scrub.&nbsp; Daria put the spray into her left
hand and squeezed the flashlight, playing the beam around.&nbsp; She saw the shoes
back between herself and the sheet, while the missing sock was partially
hanging from the girl's mouth.&nbsp; A torn skirt was also near the girl's head.</span></p>

the first frost was likely by morning, but no doubt when the girl had started
off it was warm enough with the light undershirt, shirt, and hoodie, all of
which were pushed up onto the girl's tiny breasts.&nbsp; The hood of the sweatshirt
was pulled over the girl's head, but there were a few long black curls showing.

three minutes after the patrol car.&nbsp; Lawndale was a suburb that tried to take

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria was able to identify the
girl as Leah Blum-Deckler.&nbsp; Like many couples, the Blum-Decklers had tried and
failed to conceive a child.&nbsp; A married cousin serving a tour of duty in Japan
had left behind a pregnant mistress.&nbsp; When the whole story had come out a few
years later, the Blum-Decklers had adopted the then three year old.&nbsp; As often
happens, Mrs. Blum-Deckler had gotten pregnant a little more than a year later.&nbsp;
Daria had met the now-11 year old a few times over the previous two years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The detectives were two of the
detectives Daria had met over her own assault.&nbsp; Both had taken her measure, and
while no footprints would be found, it would turn out Daria had indeed heard
the would-be rapist's escape.&nbsp; His trail would easily be traced to the point he
had emerged from the scrub, but no further.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>In fact, over the next two days,
as Leah recalled what had happened, it was clear that the rapist was
fortunately inexperienced, failing to actually rape the struggling girl.&nbsp; When
Daria's slow-approaching car was heard, the assailant had rabbit-punched the
girl into unconsciousness for a few minutes as he escaped.&nbsp; No doubt, had Daria
and Jane not stopped, he would have been close enough to come back and try
again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Leah had been to a classmate's
Halloween early supper party, but had argued with some of the other children as
they had finished trick-or-treating. (Lawndale required trick-or-treaters to be
off the streets by 9:00.) Rather than go back to the party for cider as the
parents of the children were called, Leah had started the nine block walk
home.&nbsp; She had been grabbed near to where her sheet had been found. (All the
girls had worn old white sheets with holes for eyes, in part for the visibility
and in part as a tribute to the Charlie Brown special.)&nbsp; The police, making out
the time line later, would decide that she had been fondled as she struggled for
at least five minutes before the assailant had started to partially strip her.&nbsp;
He had removed her running shoes in the first assault by stepping on the heels,
and had stuffed the sock in her mouth once he had pushed her to the ground in
the brush.&nbsp; He had had his hand over her mouth before then, but while she had
struggled she had not thought to try and bite.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>All that, of course, Daria would
also learn later.&nbsp; That Halloween night, as she came in the front door at
nearly 11:45, she was confronted by her angry and concerned mother, her very
worried father, and a rather frightened Quinn.&nbsp; All had been worried that she
was so late.&nbsp; Daria merely held up a hand for silence, and then told the trio
what little she knew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>While Jake and Helen tried to
absorb what had happened, Daria stopped Quinn before she could get to the
phone. "Tiffany and her family are going to be too busy and upset to answer the
phone, assuming they're even home.&nbsp; Now, I would imagine Tiffany won't be in
school tomorrow, at least during the morning.&nbsp; I think, if she's not, you
shouldn't say anything to anyone."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Helen was now paying attention. "Why?"
Quinn asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Because tomorrow is the first
Wednesday of the month &ndash; which is when I was attacked and when the three J's
were attacked.&nbsp; On the slim chance the same person attacked Leah, or the
equally slim chance some other high school kid did, then the security people,
who will already be on the alert might just luck out and see someone acting
like they know what's going on.&nbsp; Right now, Jane, me, you three, the
Blum-Decklers, and the rapist know what happened.&nbsp; Stacy is a natural gossip,
and while the word may get out tomorrow, you know Sandi will tell her mother,
and her brothers will overhear.&nbsp; You said one started ninth grade this year,
and the other is somewhere in middle school, right?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"So the word would get out.&nbsp; The
less that is said, the more likely that slim lead might pay off."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
