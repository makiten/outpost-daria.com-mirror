<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>No
one asked Quinn directly what might be wrong with Tiffany, and despite some
temptations, she was able not to say.&nbsp; Jane was acting nervous all day while
Daria was able to pretend that nothing was wrong.&nbsp; If anything, Daria was
looking forward to the results of her latest round of tests.&nbsp; If she was lucky,
Daria would be allowed to drop the heavy forearm and wrist brace and go to a
lighter one, like one used for those with repetitive stress.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
also noticed a full compliment of security all day, including some pass-throughs
by the bomb-sniffing dogs, more to bring their handlers through the school
several times than anything else.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>In
the end, nothing happened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>At
least, nothing anyone noticed at the time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>That
night, Daria sat sulking in the living room.&nbsp; She had been told in fact that
she would have to wait two more weeks to switch to the lighter support brace.&nbsp;
Helen and Jake were out for the evening.&nbsp; The girls had noticed that Helen had
no more time at home as a partner, but that she was now spending a bit more of
it supervising associates and junior associates, as well as a bit more
socializing with the partners of other law firms and other movers and shakers,
including politicos in Washington, Annapolis, and Baltimore.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Quinn
came down and plopped next to her sister. "Nothing on?" Quinn asked, looking at
the turned-off tv.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Nothing
fits my mood," Daria admitted. "If it were a bit colder, I'd be tempted to
build a fire, just to watch it."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Oh."
After a pause, Quinn said, "Tiffany called a while ago. Unsurprisingly, she's
pretty torn up." Despite being the most self-centered of the four Fashion Club
members in many ways, Tiffany still cared about her sister.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
can understand that," Daria acknowledged. "Did she say anything about Leah's
condition?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Physically
she's okay," Quinn replied. "She wasn't, well, she wasn't, and there are just
some bruises and aches and pains."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Well,
that's good, but how is she handling. . . ."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Tiffany
isn't sure, but then, Tiffany is not a talker," Quinn had to admit. "She
actually does see and understand more than people think she does.&nbsp; She just has
a hard time expressing herself, because she talks, you know, slow. . . ."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"She
wasn't like that when we got here," Daria pointed out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Quinn
sighed. "Please don't tell anyone, even Jane if you can help it.&nbsp; Tiffany has a
history of mild seizures.&nbsp; She reacts to her new medications like that, which
is supposed to be . . . what's the word? Atypical?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Probably."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Anyway,
it slows down her speech and even her reaction time, but not really her
thinking.&nbsp; It frustrates her at times, I know.&nbsp; She'll probably never drive,
but on the other hand, it's been over eighteen months since she had
convulsions.&nbsp; Fortunately, both her parents are physical therapists, so Tiffany's
had good care, and she did say Leah will be seeing some good counselors.&nbsp; They
get all the care they need from Cedars, because that's where the parents work."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Well,
not good news, but good to know," Daria acknowledged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"She
knew that you and Jane were the ones who helped Leah," Quinn said quietly. "So,
she asked if I could tell Sandi and Stacy, if I hadn't.&nbsp; Which, of course, I
hadn't."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Do
you want me to be with you when you do it?" Daria asked equally quietly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Quinn
shook her head. "I just got off the phone with them.&nbsp; I did ask them not to say
anything, although I don't know if that will do any good or not.&nbsp; Tiffany also
asked that I thank you and give you a hug."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Could
you just say you did both?" Daria asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
could, but . . . but I think I could use a hug," Quinn admitted, a little
teary. "This has been scary, Daria."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
said nothing, she just lifted her right arm, and Quinn scooted over.&nbsp; Daria
wrapped her good arm around Quinn's shoulder, and Quinn tucked her feet up on
the sofa and laid her head on Daria's shoulder.&nbsp; Daria rested her head against
Quinn's.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The
two sat there quietly, and fell asleep.&nbsp; Helen and Jake were quite shocked to
find them like that an hour later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>*</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The
next morning, Daria and Jane approached Tiffany.&nbsp; The other three Fashion Club
members were hovering, while Tiffany was opening her locker (on the lower tier
of lockers).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Tiffany
put her jacket away, and, before closing her locker, pried a piece of paper
from one of the air vents.&nbsp; She, like most girls, was used to getting such
messages.&nbsp; Some were nice, some were rude, some were obscene.&nbsp; She was
wondering which this might be when she saw who was approaching.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Tiffany
simply walked to meet the pair and hugged Jane tightly, and then Daria.&nbsp; To each,
she simply said, "Thank you."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jane
and even Daria hugged her back. "Excuse me a moment," Tiffany drawled.&nbsp; She
unfolded the note and read it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>And
read it again, confused for a second.&nbsp; Then, her face slowly moved to a scowl. "Does
this mean what I think it means?" she asked Daria slowly, yet almost animated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
refused to touch it, but did read the note. "It does," Daria practically
growled. "Come on, we need to take that to Ms Li." Daria turned and took a
step, but then realized Tiffany was still frozen.&nbsp; She turned back and snapped,
"Jane, Quinn, tell the homeroom teachers.&nbsp; Tiffany, come!" This time Tiffany
followed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Who
does she think she is?" Sandi asked, mostly out of bewilderment, not active
hostility.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
don't know who she thinks she is, but she knows she's potentially the most
dangerous person in this county as well as the smartest, never mind in the
school," Jane responded. "When she uses that voice, just obey.&nbsp; Let's get
going, Quinn."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>*</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
found Quinn waiting for her when she got in later that afternoon, around 5:30. "I
need to get some things," Daria said. "We can talk in my room in a few minutes,
if you want."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Quinn
merely nodded and waited at Daria's doorway while Daria let down the access
ladder and went up into the attic.&nbsp; She came down a few minutes later and
invited Quinn into her room, where she took off her boots, took out a sewing
kit, and sat on the bed in the position that traditional tailors had been using
for thousands of years while exposing the left inner side pocket of a new,
heavier denim jacket, one suitable for most days of a Maryland winter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"What
are you doing?" Quinn asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Overall,
Lawndale is much safer than Highland," Daria commented. "Still, all it takes is
one lunatic. . . ."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"What's
that?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
held up the object she had brought down from the attic. "If these were made of
brass, they'd be called brass knuckles."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Those
would set off the metal detectors."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
nodded. "Very true.&nbsp; These are made of a hardened fiber, with small hard, sharp
plastic inlays.&nbsp; A knife won't cut it and it would mess up a face pretty
badly.&nbsp; A punch to the side of a throat with it should stop most people, and a
punch to a windpipe might kill."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Quinn
swallowed at that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"No,
I don't want to hurt anyone, let alone kill them," Daria assured her sister. "I
would feel awful if I had to hurt anyone.&nbsp; I still have nightmares about
stomping Feldman; hell, I am still a bit traumatized by what I had to do to
that slime ball who was molesting you over two years ago!&nbsp; But I'd rather feel
awful because I hurt or even killed someone, than know I could have saved
myself, or you, or Jane, or a girl like Leah, and didn't." She had unpicked the
double lining of the pocket, and quickly tacked the knuckle-duster into the
lining.&nbsp; In short order, the pocket looked normal again, although she could get
the knuckle-duster free in a few seconds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"What
did the note say?" Quinn asked. "Tiffany was still too upset to be asked."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"It
said, 'Hey, Fat Jap!&nbsp; I almost got the little J.A.P. last night.&nbsp; Your turn
might be soon'." Quinn made a face of disgust while Daria finished her sewing. "Do
many people know that Tiffany has a body-image problem?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"You
mean her always asking if something makes her look fat?" Quinn asked.&nbsp; Daria
merely nodded, so Quinn added, "That's a fairly new thing, according to Sandi.&nbsp;
I'm sure a fair percentage of girls have heard her."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"But
how about guys?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Quinn
shrugged her shoulder. "I would never mention it to guys, but I wouldn't be
surprised if girls outside the club do to put Tiffany down."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"You're
probably right." Daria looked Quinn in the eye. "The odds are that note really
was from the would-be rapist.&nbsp; And, considering that yesterday was the day we
all expected the guy who attacked me and the J's to attack someone, there is at
least a fair chance they are one and the same."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"How
fair?" Quinn asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
don't know," Daria answered. "In my own mind, I'd say a ninety percent chance
the note was genuine, and at least a sixty percent chance it's the same guy who
assaulted me.&nbsp; But, I could be totally wrong."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Can
you give me a refresher on handling the bear-spray?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Of
course," Daria answered. "Don't forget. . . ."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
notified Security and the Nurse that I would be carrying before I left school
today," Quinn assured her sister. "Daria, do you think we know who's doing
this?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"If
it is all one guy, I think you know him at least," Daria replied. "You don't
know who it is," she assured her stricken sister, "but you know him.&nbsp; It was
probably sheer coincidence that it was Leah he attacked.&nbsp; I don't see how he
could have followed her from the trick-or-treaters group, and he sure couldn't
have known she was going home that way by herself, but it was dark enough the
entire time they were out that it is remotely possible.&nbsp; Still, he attacked
your sister, your three admirers, and threatened one of your friends.&nbsp; So, if
you don't know him, he certainly knows you."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I'm
afraid," Quinn said quietly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
understand," Daria said as she unpicked the hem of the jacket so she could add
the garrote.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
think I'll just alternate between Joey, Jeffy, and Jamie for a while."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Fine,
but stick with Jeffy until after the Homecoming Dance."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Right,
no need to make anyone jealous," Quinn acknowledged. "To change to a more
pleasant subject, why did you invite the rest of the Fashion Club over tomorrow
night?&nbsp; And who else did you invite?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
also invited Jane, Jodie, and Andrea," Daria replied. "As to why . . . do you
know what I miss about Seventh and Eighth grade?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Let's
see . . . nothing about school itself, I'm sure. . . ." Quinn said as she tried
to remember.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"True."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>A
memory suddenly hit. "You went to a lot of sleep-overs for a while back then,
didn't you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
did, at least until Carole and Janet both moved away the summer before I went
to Highland High," Daria acknowledged. "I was only invited to a few after that."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Quinn
smirked. "Wasn't it mostly because you were allowed to check yourself out at
the library, and you could bring all the steamy romance novels to the
sleep-overs?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"True,
especially after those two both moved away, and then the idea kind of lost its
appeal for everyone as one by one most started dating," Daria agreed. "Carole
and Janet were best friends, but I think at least one of them must have liked
me a bit to have invited me in the first place, and to have kept it going
almost two years.&nbsp; Anyway, I don't want to read to you guys, but I thought we
could watch an old movie or two that I think we'd all like."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Well,"
Quinn said, "I guess it can't hurt to try.&nbsp; How thrilled was Mom with a
short-order sleep-over?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Shocked
that we might be able to get along long enough to pull it off," Daria admitted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>*</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>If
an accurate poll could have been taken, very few of the males at Lawndale High,
and even fewer at the Middle School, really took much notice of the assault on
Leah Blum-Deckler.&nbsp; In large part, that was because it had been very
down-played in the media, and in fact few of the boys even knew who had been
assaulted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The
girls, of course, took more notice; it took little imagination for any of them
to place herself in the younger girl's place.&nbsp; Many of the males, therefore,
found their female classmates warier than usual, and a few downright hostile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Still,
life went on.&nbsp; There was a rather pep-less pep rally on Friday, and the crowd
was a bit more subdued Saturday afternoon than would have been expected against
Lawndale's archrivals.&nbsp; On the other hand, since the boys were far less
affected, the football team was ready to play the next day.&nbsp; This year, the
parade was held without the problems of the previous years, at least as far as
Daria and Jane could see from their vantage point near one of the drug stores.&nbsp;
When the Fashion Club float came by (pulled by Jamie's car this year), Daria
and Jane got the other Lawndale High girls nearby to cheer for the still-upset
and depressed Tiffany, which brought a small smile and wave from her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>*</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Tiffany
of course had to hurry home after the parade to be with her family &ndash; only her
and her family's desire to pretend to the unknowing world that everything was
fine had motivated her to ride in the parade.&nbsp; Daria was not surprised when
Andrea turned down the idea once she learned that the sleep-over was only
that.&nbsp; More surprising was Sandi's disinterest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Fortunately,
Stacy was still excited about coming.&nbsp; Jodie wanted to come, and had been
forced to do some fast talking to get her way.&nbsp; Fortunately, while her mother
disliked Helen on many levels, Jodie's father had actually come to rather like
Jake and both of Jodie's parents liked Daria.&nbsp; This was accentuated by the fact
that the first Lawndale Law tv ad was now up and running on the local stations,
and it had impressed both Landons when Jodie had pointed out it was Daria and
Jane's idea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Helen
and Jake thoughtfully went out to dinner.&nbsp; Daria laid out trays of pita and a
wide away of meats, cheeses, and veggies, plus chips and dips.&nbsp; Jane smiled as
she saw Daria make her various pita with either tuna or hummus.&nbsp; As they ate,
the teens watched <i>Forbidden Planet</i>, which, as it turned out, only Daria and
Jane had seen.&nbsp; They also had strawberry sorbet between movies.&nbsp; After dessert,
the teens got ready for bed since it was after 9:00, although bed time was
still far off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Having
seen one adventurous flic with just a hint of romance, Daria had chosen a more
romantic movie for their nightcap.&nbsp; Right after Jake and Helen had gotten in,
the teens settled down with loads of popcorn for <i>Casablanca</i>. &nbsp;Neither
Jodie nor Jane had watched it in some time, and again neither Quinn nor Stacy
had even seen it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>By
the end of movie, while not in tears, the other four girls had the sniffles.&nbsp;
As usual, only the Marseillaise scene had gotten to Daria, not only for its
genuine passion, but the feeling of desperation she felt the cast, largely
refugees from various European oppressions, conveyed to the audience &ndash; or at
least it did to her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>As
Quinn and Stacy settled down to sleep a while later, Quinn asked, "What did you
think of the movies?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Knowing
that alone with Quinn her opinions would at least not be ridiculed, Stacy said
cautiously, "Well, the first one was sort of . . . weird, especially the music,
but in the end it did really fit."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
have to admit, I was worried when it started, but in the end I can see why she
wanted us to see it," Quinn conceded. "And <i>Casablanca</i>?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
used to think your sister didn't have many emotions, but she really knows
romantic movies, doesn't she?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"She
does, although again, I was worried about it when it started," Quinn agreed. "I
sometimes think I'll never figure her out."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Next
door, Jane had taken the evening in stride and was already asleep, as was
Daria.&nbsp; Jodie, however, was awake, and wondering about the many layers of her
friend, and wondered if she had seen more than a tiny fraction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jodie
was startled to be woken the next morning by a hand touching her foot.&nbsp; She was
disoriented for a moment, wondering where she was and why she was being awakened
this way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The
first memory was of making her way through the strange house in the middle of
the night to use the toilet.&nbsp; Then she remembered which strange house she was
in &ndash; Daria's.&nbsp; Only then did she open her eyes to the bright light of morning,
with a showered and partially dressed Jane over her.&nbsp; "Hey, sleepy head," Jane
teased.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"What
time is it?" Jodie muttered. "Why don't you go run or something?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jane
snorted. "I've had breakfast, talked with the Morgendorffers separately to
avoid power-walking with Daria's Mom, run for an hour, and just got out of the
shower.&nbsp; As for the time, it's a few minutes before Eleven o'clock."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>That
made Jodie sit up. "Really?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Really,"
Jane replied. "Quinn and Stacy went over to take Tiffany and Leah shoe shopping
at some special early morning sale at Cranberry Commons.&nbsp; Apparently the legal
eagles of Oakwood and Lawndale have some big brunch the morning of this game,
and the Morgendorffers left about thirty minutes ago.&nbsp; Daria's been cooking
since a little before Nine o'clock."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
don't think I've slept this long since . . . I don't know when," Jodie

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Then
it's probably a good thing you did," Jane replied. "It's good to unwind every

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Just
left over cheese and cold cuts on equally left-over pita.&nbsp; Oh, and one of
Mister M's potential clients imports sodas from around the country to DC and
this part of the state.&nbsp; Daria said the black cherry is fantastic, and she
saved three bottles for lunch."</span></p>

and Jane would again watch the game from the student government section of the
press box.&nbsp; This time, they had stocked the fridge with root beer and had bags
of salty snacks ahead of time, but none of the girls were overly hungry during
the first half.&nbsp; While Lawndale led as the half ended 23-6, the three had tried
to solve the problem of the attacks, and had come up with nothing.</span></p>

prepared to come on, "how come there's no big fuss about homecoming during the
half-time show?&nbsp; Don't most schools announce the Homecoming Queen then? Or at

Jane teased back as she handed silverware to Jodie so she could start setting
the dining room table, "Mom is well aware of it." 'Well, three of the five

watched," Daria scolded. "I'm sure she and Dad will enjoy the rest of it with
dinner out here." She sealed the jar she had placed the surplus grease into and
tossed it. "So, never mind the recipe, but there are also turnips, potatoes,
carrots, celery, and, as the Colonel used to say, eleven herbs and spices,
although they probably aren't the same ones.&nbsp; I'm sure I used a lot more
paprika at least." She turned the stove to medium heat. "The guys will want and
need protein, and there's plenty of it.&nbsp; I'll also do Grandma Ruth's dumpling

the other side of the entrance to the kitchen, Helen backed up a few steps and

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Quinn

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Yes!"
they chorused, which was followed by two "Hi, Mrs. Morgendorffer," from Jodie
and Jane and "Hi, Mom," from Daria.&nbsp; Helen watched with amusement as the other
two girls watched Daria blend the dry ingredients and then cut in some lard and
vegetable shortening with a hand 'pastry blender', as well as an egg and just
enough buttermilk to get the right consistency.&nbsp; It was clear that neither of
the teens had seen this done before, at least outside of a cooking show.&nbsp; Helen
noticed Daria had some other ingredients to add off to the side, but other than
the bottle of paprika, she wasn't sure what they were (actually just finely
chopped chives and celery, with a little celery salt, plus some chopped bacon).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Good,"

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The
guys were seated in the dining room, and laughed when they saw the bowls Jane
had brought over (all made by her mother).&nbsp; She, Daria, and Jodie first brought
in their bowls -- nice-sized bowls holding stew that made the boys' mouth
water, and with a nice-sized dumpling which was cut in half -- but which originally
had been about two-thirds the size of a baseball.&nbsp; Mack and John got larger
bowls containing about half again as much stew and a dumpling and a half.&nbsp; Thor's
was almost a serving bowl, with twice as much stew as the girls' and two
dumplings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Once
the guys had worked their way about a third of the way through, signaled by

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"As
of last weekend, there were twenty-one undefeated teams across the state," Mack
said. "Now there are thirteen.&nbsp; Riverdale is also currently undefeated."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"We
play them next week," John added.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Six
other currently undefeated teams play each other, either next week or the week
after," Mack went on. "If we stay undefeated, we should be in the tournament."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Sixteen
teams start," John added.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"So,
if you win six more games, you'll be the state champs," Daria mused.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Exactly,"
John pointed out. "Well, I suppose if we lost to Riverdale in a close game we
could still have a shot at the playoffs.&nbsp; If we lose to Lawndale East, then we
probably wouldn't." Lawndale County East was a consolidated school district,
with the 'suburbs' of suburbs like Lawndale and Riverdale and some farming
areas.&nbsp; Since that team had a current record of 2-6, a loss to them would
indeed hurt Lawndale's chances of making the playoffs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"We
have the best points scored/points given up ratio of any undefeated team in the
state right now," Thor added. "That should also help our chances."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"What

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"So-so,"

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>That
made John wince, but he did not really disagree. Instead, he said, "We've been
lucky so far.&nbsp; When the other teams have tried to plan against us, they've done
the wrong things."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Like

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"If
they don't at least try to double-team Thor on most plays, he can usually
disrupt anything but short passes and runs to the outside," John pointed out.
"If they do double-team him, and in a few cases they try triple-teaming him,
the rest of us are good enough to usually take advantage of out-manning the
rest of the offense.&nbsp; So first of all, they have to stick to short passes to
the sides, and runs that way, which really cuts down on what the opposing
offense can do."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"The
other teams' defenses all know the key is Kevin," Thor went on. "Mack is an
excellent high school running back and an outstanding all-around athlete, but
the other running backs are nothing special.&nbsp; And Mack can be stopped if the
defense would watch him and not Kevin.&nbsp; But this year, the three J's really
give us some flexibility as receivers."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"By
rotating them so often, they stay fresh," Mack agreed. "All three have good
hands, even if they are mediocre runners once they get the ball."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"The
defenses have keyed in on Kevin by trying to pressure him," Thor went on.
"Kevin isn't bright enough to react poorly to that type of pressure and has the
skills to slip out of being sacked and to throw on the run."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"So,
you're facing Lawndale," John said to Daria. "You have a good, flexible high
school team and the inside scoop on the Lawndale players.&nbsp; How would you play
us?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I'd
keep my best blocking running back in the backfield for most plays to help
protect the quarterback from Theo, while running at least half the plays to the
outsides," Daria responded. "As for Kevin . . . I'd keep the defense in as much
motion as is allowable, because he might not be able to follow random
movement.&nbsp; And the defensive players should make as much distracting chatter as
they're allowed for the same reason."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Exactly,"
Mack replied. "Kevin just doesn't have the mental capacity to figure out
changing defensive backfield patterns when they shift at the last second.&nbsp;
Fortunately, no one has figured that out yet."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Let's
hope they never do!" Theo replied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Meanwhile,
in the kitchen, Helen and Jake were marveling at Daria's stew as they ate at
the breakfast table. "Wow!&nbsp; This is really good!" Jake said for the third time.
"And I know I shouldn't say this, but the dumplings are better than Mom's!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Helen
was a bit torn by all this, but she only said, "Considering the top-grade
ingredients Daria used, I'm glad it came out so well."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
wonder why Daria's never cooked like this before," Jake mused.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>That
did amuse Helen. "I would imagine so she doesn't get stuck doing the cooking.&nbsp;
Doing a special meal is one thing; doing cooking from scratch very often would
take more time that any one of us would want to give.&nbsp; Remember, both Daria and
Quinn scored hundreds in home ec during middle school."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"That's
true," Jake had to admit.&nbsp; He looked down at his large bowl of stew with
satisfaction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Daria
used very lean meats, including bison and even ostrich," Helen pointed out. "She
also used canned broth instead of making it from scraps and bones, and bought
the low sodium version, so that was likely healthier as well.&nbsp; On top of that,
she added herbs and what tastes like some shredded bacon to the dumplings.&nbsp; Not
to mention that she used less shortening than your Mother's recipe, and only a
small part of that was lard.&nbsp; With all the carbs in these dumplings, it can't
be a perfectly healthy meal, but it's pretty close to healthy."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Either
way, it's darn good." He raised his glass of Austrian Zweigelt. "This is good,
too, especially for the price." He lowered the glass of red wine a bit. "Do we
want to know how she knew about this?&nbsp; I never heard of it."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Let's
just assume she's as good researching wines as she is everything else," Helen
stated, also raising her glass. "To our eldest."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jake
gently clinked his glass to Helen's.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>*</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The
dancers caused a bit of a stir during the homecoming dance, but given whom some
of those dancers were, there was no criticism.&nbsp; Instead, it turned out that a
fair number of the Lawndale students had enduring dance lessons in one form or
another &ndash; unsurprising, perhaps, given the very middle-to-upper middle class
demographics most of them came from.&nbsp; By the end of the evening, nearly a
quarter of the students had at least tried to adjust their rusty ballroom
dancing skills to accommodate the stylings of <i>Mystic Spiral</i>, a trend
which would continue at Lawndale High dances for the next four years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>By
the time the dance was over, many of the students &ndash; especially the football
players, cheerleaders, and band members &ndash; were pretty well exhausted.&nbsp; Brittany
Taylor certainly was, but she found she could not sleep.&nbsp; After tossing and
turning for nearly an hour, she gave up and got out of bed.&nbsp; She turned on the
lights and simply sat at her vanity, staring into the mirror.&nbsp; The conversation
she had had with Daria at the dance simply wouldn't leave her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jodie
had mentioned that Daria would be in charge of the Lawndale Spring Review, and
so she had asked Daria if she thought the balcony scene from <i>Romeo and
Juliet</i> might fit in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Why
do you think Kevin would do a better job on stage in front of a large audience
than he did at the coffee house?" Daria had asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Brittany's
shoulders had slumped, as did her chin. "He wouldn't," she had whispered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Brittany,
if the Review goes off as I hope, I promise you'll be featured in at least one
of the numbers."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Why?"
Brittany had asked. "We're not really friends, even if we get along."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Do
you really want to know?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
do," Brittany had answered.&nbsp; Looking back, Brittany felt like she had been in a
story, a fairy tale, and was asking the good witch, the fairy godmother, the
master narrator in short, for why there was suddenly an unexpected path.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
could say that it's because, even though it was a backhanded invitation, you
did invite me to my first party at Lawndale.&nbsp; I could say it's because of what
you told me when I was emotionally confused about wearing my contacts.&nbsp; I could
even say it's in part because, although we are not friends, we are friendly &ndash;
you've never intentionally put me down, you've always treated me as a person of
worth, even though most of what we value is very different from each other.&nbsp; In
short, you really are a good person, Brittany Taylor.&nbsp; While all that is true,
above all I have a vision for the Review, and there is at least one part you
can play in it that I think you would enjoy."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Thinking
about that scene for now the sixth time, Brittany realized that while she had
never really been mean to Daria, she hadn't been nearly as nice as she should
have been.&nbsp; Yet Daria, who could easily cut her down now that the power was
reversed to some degree, was offering her a hand.&nbsp; That started a chain of
remembrances of other offers she had made in return for help; most had turned
out badly.&nbsp; But then, that was Daria.&nbsp;&nbsp; Brittany turned off her lights and
looked out the window at the twinkling stars.&nbsp; That always made her feel small,
and yet connected. "You're a good person, too, Daria," she whispered to the
Universe, "no matter how hard you try to hide it."</span></p>
