<p class=MsoNormal><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>With her after
school activities and occasional dates, Daria had seen very little of Trent,
outside her and Jane's now-rare forays to McGrundy's or the Zon.&nbsp; She was a
little ashamed that Trent had had to ask Jane to get her to come over to talk
on Sunday.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
knew there was no reason to arrive before 2:00.&nbsp; As it was, when she came at
2:45, Trent was just having his first cup of coffee. "Hey, Daria."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
slid into one of the kitchen chairs. "Hey," she responded. "Do you have some
more music for me?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"We
do, but that's not why I needed to see you," Trent said.&nbsp; His shoulders
slumped. "I hate to ask this, but we need a favor."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"'We'
being the band?" Daria asked.&nbsp; She knew Trent would have been less shy if Jane
needed something, while if the favor was merely for himself, he likely would
not have even asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Exactly,"
Trent answered, nodding. "I wouldn't ask just for me.&nbsp; Still, the guys are
excited of course.&nbsp; It was all I could do to put them off at first."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Of
course," Daria agreed. "And they are excited about what exactly?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Trent
looked at Daria, frowning.&nbsp; Then he looked at his mostly full cup of coffee and
sipped at it.&nbsp; Then Trent looked at Daria, opened his mouth, and then shut it
for a moment, before asking, "I didn't answer your question, did I?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Err,
no," Daria had to answer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Trent
looked around, frowning, and then stood up.&nbsp; He had been sitting on a folder of
papers. "We've been offered a contract, for touring and music."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>All
Daria said was, "Ah." She almost had managed to hide her surprise that the band
would ever get an offer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Trent
nodded. "I know.&nbsp; I like to think we're good, but even if we are as good as we
like to think we are, there are a lot of rip-offs in the music business."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I'll
take care of things," Daria assured Trent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"We
know," Trent agreed.&nbsp; Daria's eyebrows went up.&nbsp; Trent sipped a bit more coffee
and said, "We've been at this a while.&nbsp; The last few months has been the
closest we've come to making a real living, and in part it's because we play so
often we're playing better and in part because of your lyrics.&nbsp; Suddenly, an
old guy comes along and offers us a chance to tour and, oh, by the way, why
don't you throw your songs into the pot, too?&nbsp; Not us recording our songs, but
the songs themselves.&nbsp; We're small time and none of us are sharp entrepreneurs,
but once we got over the excitement of being asked, we're not that stupid."
Trent nodded at the contract in the folder. "There's hardly a sentence I
understand.&nbsp; How about you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
opened the folder and speed-read through parts of it. "Well, I understand it's
written in high-level legalese," Daria answered. "This is the type of language
which lawyers use for any combination of three reasons: to impress the hell out
of each other; to close every loophole they can think of; or to screw some poor
dumb bastard out of his fillings."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"And
do you understand it?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Oh,
hell no," Daria replied. "This can only be understood by a good lawyer if it's
well written.&nbsp; If it's poorly written, then it might take a great lawyer to
figure out if it means anything."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Trent
sighed and slumped even more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Hey,
I wrote all or part of most of your current lyrics.&nbsp; You can't sell them
without me, and so I need legal advice."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
can't ask you to do that," Trent said. "I know how you feel about it.&nbsp; For that
matter, I know how I feel about it!" Trent shuddered. "I just couldn't do that
to a friend."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Trent,
there are two reason why I did all those lyrics," Daria said firmly.&nbsp; Then she
added, "Well, three if you include the practice.&nbsp; The first was to help a
friend."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"And
the other one?" Trent asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Trent,
I want to make a decent living out my writing if I can.&nbsp; Just like you wrote
that jingle for Happy Herb, if I have to, I'll write greeting cards to support
my other writing.&nbsp; I'd rather write jingles than greeting cards; I'd much
rather write lyrics to real songs than commercial jingles.&nbsp; I get to hear what
I write for you.&nbsp; That's more than just practice." She held up the contract. "I
am not getting ripped off; I will not let my partners get ripped off.&nbsp; I want
you to make it because you're my friend; and I want <i>Mystic Spiral</i> to
make it because then I make it, too."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Trent
thought about that, then nodded. He thought a moment and stood up again, this
time so he could give Daria another piece of paper, this time from his back
pocket. "Here.&nbsp; This says, well, you read it."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
took the sheet of paper, signed by all four band members, and saw it authorized
Daria to be the band's full agent in all legal dealings.&nbsp; She looked at Trent
in surprise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"You
value money more than I do," Trent pointed out, "but you also value friendship
more than anyone I have ever met.&nbsp; Even if you were mad at the guys, you'd
protect them from anyone else on the planet, unless they'd hurt someone you
cared about more.&nbsp; And no, I didn't say anything.&nbsp; Jesse said it first."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"And
what did Jesse say?" Daria asked, amused.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Well,
Max was having one of his fits as he tried to make that thing out &ndash; he's been
ripped off by sales contracts he didn't understand.&nbsp; Nick said we didn't dare
sign it unless someone could figure it out.&nbsp; After his divorce settlement,
well, it wasn't pretty.&nbsp; So before I could say anything, Jesse said, 'Ask
Daria.&nbsp; She's cool'."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
smiled prettily for a moment at the compliment, and then her smiled widened &ndash;
an orca would be going shark hunting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>*</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Mom,
can we talk?" Daria asked later that evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
take it this is something serious?" Helen asked.&nbsp; Daria was already dressed for
bed.&nbsp; In just socks, shorts, and a loose t-shirt and her hair pulled back,
Daria looked very young and vulnerable (as she intended, of course).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Helen
followed Daria into her bedroom. "What is it, Sweetie?" 'Please don't let her
and Theo be having sex!' Helen thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
hate to do this, but I need a favor," Daria said. "A legal one."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Helen
blinked.&nbsp; While she was off-balance, Daria told her the story of her lyrics,
the band's improvement, and the offer. "Let me see it," Helen simply said,
holding out her hand.&nbsp; Daria handed her mother the stack of paper, the band's
authorization on top.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Helen
glanced at the first page of the contract, frowned, and then sat down at
Daria's desk, switching a desk lamp on as she did so.&nbsp; After five minutes,
Helen was only on the second page of the twelve page document.&nbsp; She sighed and
looked at her daughter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Tell
me, is that dribble masquerading as legalese, or is that the most high-flown
and elaborate legalese there is?" Daria asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Oh,
it's the latter," Helen replied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Would
Trent have had any fillings left if he and the band had signed that?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
haven't gotten far enough to say," Helen admitted. "However, few lawyers use
this type of language just to show they can.&nbsp; We just hired on an entertainment
law associate &ndash; his wife is our new immigration law junior associate.&nbsp; I'll ask
him to look at it and see what he thinks."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
hate needing this type of favor," Daria admitted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
understand." Helen favored Daria with the same orca smile Daria had given Trent
earlier. "And who knows; this might be fun."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>*</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Trent
was surprised when Daria called him the next evening and told him they had an
appointment at Lawndale Law the next day at 4:00. "Are you alright?" Daria
asked him as they stood in the lobby of the wing of the office building that
Lawndale Law occupied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Trent
was pale, and was dressed in his 'best' &ndash; newish jeans, a clean flannel shirt
that was partially buttoned over a black t-shirt, a old but whole denim jacket,
and a pair of boots that had been polished at some point, but not very recently.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Then
Trent caught sight of the 'Lawndale Law' sign Jane had painted.&nbsp; He looked at
Daria and coughed.&nbsp; Then he said, "You know how I feel about authority." He
sighed. "I guess I have to grow up." His shoulders sagged. "I just realized, if
we do pull this off, I'll even have to get a watch."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I'm
afraid so, Peter Pan."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Well,
then let's go see what the news is."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
saw that Trent was sweating, and even shaking a little. "Here," Daria said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"What?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
waved her hand in front of Trent's face and then lowered it. "Take my hand."
Daria smirked. "It's pretty clean."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Trent
returned the smirk as he remembered and just put his arm around Daria's
shoulders and gave her a brief squeeze before dropping his arm. "Naw, I know
you'll protect me.&nbsp; That's enough."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The
lawyer they were meeting with was Victor James, a rather average looking man of
about thirty. "Well," he said somewhat jovially, "you two managed to make my
week.&nbsp; I don't know if I'll be able to make yours."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"How
is that?" Daria asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Back
a little more than thirty years ago, there were two friends out in California.&nbsp;
They had been friends since they were college roommates, and one was in law
school and the other in business school.&nbsp; Both had played in different bands,
and even in the same bands, but never came close to making it.&nbsp; They started
organizing concerts instead, and around Nineteen-seventy they went into it full
time. The business school man had five younger brothers, and over the next
fifteen years, they all came into the business.&nbsp; The lawyer brought in a few
relatives as well.&nbsp; Now, anyone not an insider just looking around would think
their one company was actually about a dozen or so competing against each
other, but it's one big Company, one of the biggest, in fact.&nbsp; They have
concert tours of all kinds all over the United States and Canada, and those
tours have at times reached overseas.&nbsp; And by all kinds, I mean just that &ndash; any
type of rock, pop, and even some country, rap, jazz, and classical.&nbsp; Still,
it's mostly rock and pop, and except for a little fusion or cross-over country,
that's all they arrange to have recorded."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Seeing
the two were following, James continued. "Now, they don't have any real
superstars, or even real stars signed.&nbsp; They specialize in running the concert
tours, organizing the merchandizing, and supplying the other acts when the real
stars tour, so that they and their managers don't have to do all the work."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Other
acts?" Daria asked, mostly for clarification.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Sometimes
the other stuff is pre-recorded, but these folks still prefer all live music.&nbsp;
So, a really big show might have a band playing as the people come in, then a
real warm-up band, an opening act that might be pretty well-known, the main
group or star, and maybe then another band playing for a bit as the crowd
leaves.&nbsp; Their other concerts, except for the really small ones, might have the
same band doing the walk-ins and outs.&nbsp; With me so far?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The
pair nodded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Now,
excluding the stars and superstars they work with but don't have under contract,
they rank their contract acts pretty simply: As; Bs; Cs; Ds; and Fs.&nbsp; They
don't usually sign Fs unless they have a short term need for a throw-away band,
or if the band has something they want."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Like
their tunes," Trent groused.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Exactly,"
James agreed. "They offered you a double-F contract.&nbsp; To tell you the truth, I
had heard of them, but didn't think they actually existed.&nbsp; I thought they were
a law-school legend.&nbsp; The Company itself is pretty well-known, and we studied
them in some of the entertainment law classes."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"So,
we're F'ed?" Trent managed to joke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"They
want your tunes," James agreed. "The questions are: how badly do they want them
and what do they actually think of you?&nbsp; If they hate your band, there's not
much we can do except get you a good deal for your songs if you want one.&nbsp; It's
also possible that it's not that they hate or even dislike you, but that they
have enough other bands they don't need to bring one along if they can rip you
off instead." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>James
saw they were about to ask questions and held up his hands. "Now, despite their
offer, when they give out the decent contracts &ndash; the A's, B's, and even C's &ndash; they
are also well known for fulfilling them better than most agencies and studios.&nbsp;
So, may I contact them and see what I can do?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Trent
slumped. "I don't know if I can ask that." James frowned in confusion. "No
offense," Trent added, "but I don't think you work cheap."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"True,"
James agreed. "However, you're giving me a chance to take on one of the giants
in my field.&nbsp; If I can win, I'll still bring in a little something, plus I will
have shown my bosses what I can do, and, yes, I'll have done a favor for one of
them."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Trent,

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Shapiro
winced. "How did it get to you?" The firm's agents rarely recruited Fs, and
those few they did rarely could go to as good a lawyer as Victor James.&nbsp; Double
Fs were even more rare; as that meant the music was at least potentially very
good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Obviously
what you want is their music," James replied.&nbsp; Shapiro of course knew that
those groups signed only for F playing contracts usually didn't even have their

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Did

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"As
ordered, one quiche and a bottle of sparkling pink lemonade," the confused teen
replied as he started the truck. "Where to?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Confused
but certainly willing, Thor did as he was told.&nbsp; He left the quiche on the
kitchen table and put the bottle of lemonade in the refrigerator, and was very
happy to follow Daria, who was wearing a tighter skirt than usual, up the
stairs.&nbsp; He watched with growing excitement as Daria turned off the lights to
his room &ndash; a recently acquired small red lava lamp gave more than enough
light.&nbsp; Then as Daria requested, Thor stripped and lay on the bed.&nbsp; He was more
than happy to watch Daria slowly strip down her to her panties and then come
and lie down next to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>After
over half an hour of heavy kissing and petting, Daria laid Thor on his back,
took him in hand, and, her eyes meeting his, slowly lowered her head and gave
herself a present, glad she had been coached by Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Just
over two hours later, Thor returned Daria home. "Thank you," he said as he
kissed her deeply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Thank

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"That
was more my present to myself than one from you, even though you were a most
tasty and delightful delivery system," Daria answered. "I wanted to prove to
myself I could."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Until
tomorrow at Two," Theo said, kissing her again.&nbsp; He then watched Daria get out
of the truck and go into the house, both pleased by the evening and concerned
that so much was going on inside Daria's head that he had no clue to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria's
birthday that Sunday was unusually well-attended.&nbsp; In fact, it was by far the
most attended birthday she had ever had.&nbsp; Besides her parents and Quinn, Jane,
Thor, John, Jodie, Mack, Trent, and Brittany were there.&nbsp; Andrea had been
invited but did not wish to be near Mack and Jodie, although she had sent a
present (a comic strip featuring Daria and Jane snarking in the halls of
Lawndale High).&nbsp; Helen had swallowed her residual resentments and prejudices
and had invited Amy, who had come.&nbsp; Helen and Amy were managing to be friendly,
which pleased everyone who knew them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The
party was not fancy &ndash; lots of finger sandwiches, chips &amp; dips (not to
mention carrot sticks and celery), and of course ice cream and cake.&nbsp; At
Daria's request, all the presents were kept small.&nbsp; Still, she was pleased.&nbsp;
She knew she still had stronger defenses than most people would consider
normal, but felt that over the previous seven months, she had (for the most
part) torn down some of the defenses which were hindering her.&nbsp; If she was
careful, those that remained would be under her control.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Helen
told Daria the next Tuesday that she should round up <i>Spiral</i> for a
meeting Thursday at 4:00, and that Jane should come.&nbsp; Jane, of course, did not
want to miss an afternoon of painting, but she could hardly turn down the
invitation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
was a bit amused at seeing the band's reaction to the law firm and the typical
run of clients &ndash; and the associates' and clients' reaction to the band as she
and Jane herded them along to James' office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Once
the band was settled in, however uncomfortably, James quickly started the
meeting after Daria had made the introductions. "First of all, Ms Morgendorffer
told me that you were all informed by both her and by Mister Lane of my opinion
of your original contracts.&nbsp; Is that correct?" Getting affirmatives, he went
on, "Now it turns out, the Company, as it's commonly called, would really like
your music, with or without you attached.&nbsp; They made a good offer for the music
without your recording it, and also made an offer where, with a lot of hard
work and some luck, you might be able to make a good living off your music for
at least a few years.&nbsp; Ms Morgendorffer said she believes you'd prefer the second
option, but it's up to you.&nbsp; Shall I tell you what you would need to do?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Needless
to say, the band was interested.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Well,
to succeed, you'd have to agree to a pretty tough tour schedule, starting in
January.&nbsp; Two weeks of intense rehearsals, and then twelve weeks of touring,
with four to six concerts every week. Seven weeks touring with one band, five
weeks with another.&nbsp; I have to say, I never heard of either band, and as far as
I've seen, neither has had a hit in the top sixty. &nbsp;You'd be playing two half
hour sets, one as the crowd comes in, one on their way out.&nbsp; Now let's be
honest, some of those people will be hostile, in part because you're the
warm-up and closing band, and in part because these won't be top bands on the
upper bill.&nbsp; You've probably played in front of worse crowds, but not of this
size."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"How
large?" Daria asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"At
the largest concerts those last five weeks?&nbsp; Two to three thousand."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>That
made the band members exchange looks &ndash; these crowds would indeed be at least
ten times the largest size they were used to, if not twenty times.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Before
they put you in front of really large crowds, they want to see if you can
handle it, for the first tour will be with crowds of five hundred to a thousand.&nbsp;
In addition, while they don't want to change your sound, they would like you to
play a little tighter.&nbsp; The third thing they want to test is if you can handle
the pressure of touring without falling apart while keeping to a schedule."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jesse
looked at Trent. "You're getting a watch, dude." Trent merely winced, but
nodded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"On
the twelve week tour, you'll only have t-shirts for them to sell.&nbsp; If they like
what you've done, then you'll be spending three weeks recording, have two weeks
off to work on new material, and then move up a step to be the closing band for
some big tours, or maybe even two steps and be the walk-in band. That would be
after about two weeks of rehearsal, so with luck you'll have at least one cd to
sell by then as well as the t-shirts.&nbsp; Now, the overall offer they made shows
me they're serious about giving you a shot.&nbsp; But, it's up to you to decide." He
showed them their choices &ndash; two stacks of paper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Did

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"It's
up to you; if all four of you are willing to really work at least as hard on
your music as you have been, and even harder to keep to schedule, then the
concert route gives you a real shot at what you've all said you really want.&nbsp;
It won't be easy, but it is what you all claim you want to do."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"But

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Yes,"
Daria answered. "This is likely your best shot."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I'm

am I," Nick agreed. "We'll get some more details before we sign, right?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Of

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"You

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Alright,
before you sign, let me talk you through some of the important points," James
told them. "Ms Lane, you're here because you designed the <i>Mystic Spiral</i>
t-shirt and the original banner and symbol, correct?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
did," Jane agreed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"If
it comes to it, will you want a shot at designing the cd covers?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Of
course!" Jane said enthusiastically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Okay,
they'll be reproducing the <i>Spiral</i> banner, and you'll get a hundred for
that.&nbsp; The band's share of any t-shirt will be a dollar and a quarter.&nbsp; From
that, Ms Lane will get a quarter, Ms Morgendorffer a nickel.&nbsp; Lawndale Law,
which will also be officially registering and supervising the use of your logo
and copyrights, will get fifteen cents.&nbsp; You'll each get twenty cents." James
gave the band dirty looks. "The Company will make certain all royalties are
paid, along with all taxes."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Ah,
man," Max grumbled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>James
slid a cd over towards Jane. "This has the official software for designing cd
covers, including design blueprints." Jane merely nodded and picked it up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Now,
the reason I know the Company is serious is your signing bonus." The band again
perked up. "Now, before we get to that, let's talk about your pay and expenses."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>James
shook his head. "No, a hundred each per gig.&nbsp; Fifty-seven gigs, fifty-seven
hundred each, minus taxes.&nbsp; However, you really shouldn't have to pay a cent
out of pocket."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

only things you should have to pay for are for entertainment &ndash; and let me tell
you guys something up front.&nbsp; The Company doesn't care what you do on your own
time, but if you get busted or wreck a room or get arrested for drunk and
disorderly or something, or miss the tour bus or worst of all if you're late,
drunk, or stoned during a performance, they'll leave your asses and gear in a
pile by the side of the road in the middle of nowhere &ndash; or maybe two piles in
two different places."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Well,
there will likely be a lot of shit floating around, so be careful," James
warned. "Okay, there should be three buses, four trucks, and an RV in both tour

confused, he added, "The walk-in/closing band &ndash; that's you &ndash; the main band, and

shouldn't have to sleep on the buses on this tour &ndash; that does happen, though,
so this time you're just lucky.&nbsp; You'll have two rooms to split each night; and
you also get free meals plus food at the concerts backstage.&nbsp; Don't overdo it

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Providing
you don't make too big a mess &ndash; and I was in a band, guys, so you know I know
what can happen, if it does, clean it your selves &ndash; but the Company people will
even do your laundry.&nbsp; If they have to clean up real messes, though, they'll
probably throw a roll of quarters at you.&nbsp; And I do mean throw!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Again,
the band nodded.&nbsp; Jesse turned to Trent. "You still owe me a shirt." Trent
merely nodded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"So,
food, transportation, lodging, all provided for.&nbsp; Now, the signing bonus."
James glared at the band. "Do I just turn your portions over to you guys, or do
you want your manager to take care of you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Is
it a lot?" Jesse asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"For
what you guys are used to?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; As a band bonus?&nbsp; Not really."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Let
Daria do it," Jesse said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Yeah,"
Max and Nick agreed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Trent
merely nodded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Now,
as for your music, if you are kept on to record it, so long as you sell enough
of each song, they can't let any of their other artists play or record that
song.&nbsp; You submitted thirty-nine songs, and you will be able to choose at least
twelve of them to record.&nbsp; And yes, I got you good deals if you can generate some
real interest.&nbsp; The Company is on-line and if they record you, they'll have a
web page where people can order your music and t-shirts." James again pointed
at the contracts they were about to sign.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Anything
else?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The
band looked around, and shook their collective heads.&nbsp; James then handed each
an envelope as each signed. "There's an advance on your bonus of three hundred
and seventh-five dollars each."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Nick,
we both know where a third of that should go, right?" Daria asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Nick
merely nodded, as he knew his common-law wife and daughter could use it,
despite her having a good job.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
went on. "Guys, a third of that should go for checking your equipment, other
than your amps &ndash; the Company will supply the amps and someone to work their
sound system.&nbsp; Trent, I know you have at least three guitars, and Jesse, you
have at least two.&nbsp; Nick?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
have another old ax," Nick said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Max?"
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
could put together another kit," Max agreed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Have
them all ready to go, you don't want to be stuck looking for a last-second
replacement while you're on tour in the middle of nowhere," Daria warned. "I
hate shopping, but we'll go after Christmas to get your clothes, strings,
sticks, et cetera."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The
band signed where they were told to and left, with Jane and Daria driving off
in her VW.&nbsp; They decided to go off and celebrate with burgers and ice cream.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>As
they got in the VW, Daria handed Jane an envelope.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"An

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Oh."&nbsp;
Jane thought a moment. "Just how big is their signing bonus?"</span></p>
