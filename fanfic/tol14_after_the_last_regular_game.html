<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Lawndale
has its chance at the State Championship, Daria and Jane further their
relationships with Theo and John, and each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>John
and Thor leaned back in the hot tub and let the swirling water relax them.&nbsp; The
regular season was over, and Lawndale had trounced Lawndale County East 45-10.&nbsp;
Had Kevin not thrown two interceptions, they might even have achieved a
shutout.&nbsp; In any event, Lawndale had its first undefeated season since Tommy
Sherman had led the team to the state championship.&nbsp; And Lawndale was assured of
at least a shot at the playoffs, although the actual matches would not be
announced until Tuesday night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Thor
and John had, as usual, taken Daria and Jane out to dinner, followed by a long
session in the hot tub.&nbsp; Daria and Jane had only left the tub a little more
than ten minutes before, and had in fact just popped their heads in to say
goodbye before Daria drove her best friend home, where the two would be
spending the night.&nbsp; Both of the football players were still in a daze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
can't believe Daria did that to you when Jane and I were watching," John
finally said after a few more minutes of silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Considering
Jane was doing the same thing to you at the time, I don't think she saw too
much," Thor retorted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"No,
I could tell she was watching almost as closely as I was," John maintained.
"She was certainly turned-on by it!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
think all three of us were," Thor agreed. "Even before Daria helped Jane get-off
on your leg."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
really like Jane, and her look," John had to admit, "but damn, Daria's boobs
are even more perfect than I had thought."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"They
are," Thor agreed. "And if you ever tell anyone that, remember, it will be
Daria who goes after you; I won't have to."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Don't
worry," John assured his friend. "First of all, I doubt anyone would believe me
anyway." No one gossiped about Daria when Theo was nearby, but they sometimes
did when John was.&nbsp; Except perhaps for Mack, none of the other football players
understood why anyone would give Daria a second look.&nbsp; "Second, if I've learned
anything about Daria that I didn't know before the start of school this year, I
have learned that not only is she even smarter and more ruthless than I had
thought, she's also a lot more dangerous."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"She
is, and damn cute, not to mention sexy," Thor added.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"If
I hadn't already thought that, she would have proven it to me tonight!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
wouldn't mention it again, not even to her or Jane, if you want a repeat
showing," Thor warned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"True,"
John agreed, forcing himself to relax some more.&nbsp; He thought a moment and said,
"You know, I don't think college will be better than this."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Thor
smiled sadly, knowing there was at least a fair chance that his relationship
with Daria wouldn't last long past graduation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"You're
awfully quiet," Daria commented to Jane as she drove them through town.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"We
just got our boyfriends off in front of the other's, and then you and John got
me off twice while Thor watched," Jane pointed out. "Can I ask you something?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Of
course you may."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jane
rolled her eyes at the correction to her grammar, but went ahead and asked, "Are
you dying?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
was glad she was pulling up to a red light, because if she had been in heavy
traffic there might have been an accident. "What?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Are
you dying?&nbsp; Trying to get the most out of life before, well, you know. . . ."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The
light was a short one, and Daria went forward. "As far as I know, I am
perfectly healthy, Jane.&nbsp; Still," Daria had to admit, "I have to say I
understand why you asked that the way you did.&nbsp; Compared to how I acted before
this year, or at least before last summer, I am certainly acting differently."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Acting
differently, yes," Jane agreed. "I mean, your underlying personality hasn't
changed much, so I haven't looked for the pod, or even for electrodes. . . ."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"If
you want to do a search for electrodes implanted just under my skin, we can
talk about it at your place, if there's no one else there."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Stop
flirting with me!&nbsp; I don't know what to say when you do that!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
rested her hand on Jane's knee and asked, "Do you really want me to stop?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jane
shivered a little. "No," she whispered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Good.&nbsp;
Now, part of this is me acting as I wish I comfortably could; most of me still
wants to sit back and observe and then make nasty but very clever comments.&nbsp;
But what kind of life experience is that?&nbsp; Over the next three to eight years,
I am going to studying and writing like crazy.&nbsp; I am not going to have much time
for a guy and a regular relationship, not to mention casual sexual contact or
even football games and extracurricular activities that I can tell my mother about
or other such stuff.&nbsp; So, I'm fitting most of that into this year, because what
I do in a sense doesn't matter."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jane
wasn't sure what her friend meant. "Huh?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
am basically accepted into the colleges I want, Jane.&nbsp; My grades are a matter
of pride, so I won't let them slip, at least not much, but my final high school
GPA is irrelevant and I'm finished with the SAT and all the achievement and
proficiency exams.&nbsp; So long as I don't get hurt or hurt anyone or do anything
illegal, does it matter if I have a fling with Theo, or that John sees me having
sexual contact with Theo and even with you?&nbsp; I really like Theo, but I'm not in
love with him, and I don't think he's in love with me, although he is at least
somewhat infatuated. If we do fall in love with each other, that's good, but I
suspect we will just be very pleasant memories to each other well before this
time next year.&nbsp; On the other hand, hopefully even if we never go further than
we did tonight, or even if we don't repeat what we did, you and I will still be
together in some fashion."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
don't know what to say," Jane admitted. "Tell me, you made love to me in a
sense tonight, didn't you?&nbsp; I mean, you didn't just help get me off twice."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Yes,
I think I did both," Daria had to agree.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Then
part of the answer to your unspoken question would be yes, but only if you
allow me to do with same with you.&nbsp; You still haven't let Thor touch you, have
you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Not
like either John or I were touching you, let alone the equivalent of what we
did to the guys," Daria admitted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Do
you think you will?&nbsp; Allow either Thor or myself, that is?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
hope so," Daria said softly. "I know I'm not there yet, by myself or with you
or anyone else."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"If
Mom has already left, we know Trent won't be home," Jane said. "Would you,
well, shave me?&nbsp; I decided it would be awkward to do it myself, and I think
John would like it better."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
will."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"And
will you let me shave you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
bit her lower lip in thought, but then said in a small voice. "Yes."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The
next morning, when Daria woke up she was still in Jane's bed, rather than in
the sleeping bag on the floor as she always had before, other than when she had
slept in Penny's old room.&nbsp; She tensed for a moment, and then relaxed. &nbsp;The
pair had not 'made love' or had sex in any way.&nbsp; They had, however, cuddled.&nbsp;
Daria thought about that for a moment. Only her closest friends and family
would have been able to tell she was smiling just a little at the memories of
affection.&nbsp; Those meant far more to her than mere physical gratification.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>*</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The
Lawndale football team and their fans were hoping that they would be one of the
top seeds; if nothing else that might allow them at least one game that wasn't
too tough.&nbsp; Instead, Lawndale was seeded ninth in the field of sixteen, meaning
they would be playing the eighth seed, a larger school from Baltimore, at that
team's home field.&nbsp; All the first round games would be that Friday, the day
after Thanksgiving.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Since
Amanda had left town the previous weekend and would not return until she and
Vincent came for Christmas (they were spending the time together in Washington
D.C.), Jane would join the Morgendorffers for Thanksgiving dinner. (Trent and
the band were playing two sets out of town Thanksgiving afternoon and
evening.)&nbsp; Since Helen had not cooked a Thanksgiving (or Christmas) dinner
since the year before Daria had been born, it was no trouble for her to order
food for five instead of four.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>When
the 'dinner' was over, around 3:00, Quinn took off for Tiffany's.&nbsp; The Fashion
Club would be leaving from there early the next morning to haunt the malls on
'Black Friday' &ndash; not to mention all day Saturday plus Sunday afternoon.&nbsp; Daria
made a show of allowing her parents to 'convince' her to leave for the weekend
as well.&nbsp; While there would be a big college football party given by the firm's
partners on Saturday, Helen and Jake had other, more intimate party plans for
themselves for the next 40 hours or so.&nbsp; They enjoyed their time alone so much,
that Helen got an interesting idea for New Year's, which she would talk to
Daria and Quinn about later on in early December.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
put up a slight fuss, in part for pure show, in part to extract a reasonable
bribe (some of the leftovers and $60 for the expenses of the school-sponsored
trip to the playoff game the next day), but mostly because she knew that Jane
had some devious (or more likely these days, deviant) plans for her &ndash; Jane was
fast adapting to the idea of physical contact with Daria.&nbsp; In addition to
whatever Jane might have planned, Jane and Daria would be watching the first of
the high school orchestra concerts given for the community as well as the
second of the community orchestra's concerts.&nbsp; Had John and Thor not been
playing in the first, and Thor's parents in the second, the pair would have, of
course, skipped both, just as they would have missed all the football games
that season.&nbsp; These were prices the pair were prepared to pay, and both John
and Thor would show their appreciation of the support.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>It
turned out, however, that Jane's plans merely included a fire in the fire
place, a rubber sheet, and a large bottle of massage oil.&nbsp; Daria certainly
enjoyed massaging Jane, but while she enjoyed being massaged, no matter how intimate
Jane's massage of her was, she just could not quite relax enough to 'go over
the edge.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>To
her immense surprise, she did enjoy the attempt, however.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
and Jane sat with Jodie the next afternoon at the first playoff game.&nbsp; The
Lawndale defense was in top form throughout the game, as was the offense
through the first three quarters of the game and well into the final quarter.&nbsp;
It was at that point that Kevin pulled a 'Tommy Sherman' and, in a two-point
conversion, ran into the goal post, nearly giving himself a concussion.&nbsp;
Lawndale, however, managed to hold on to the 15-14 win despite Kevin being out
for the rest of the game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>While
the Lawndale football supporters were happy for the narrow win, they were not
happy the following Monday evening when the next game was announced.&nbsp; It would
be played the following Saturday afternoon in the western fringes of the
state.&nbsp; Only the most die-hard or affluent fans were likely to make the
journey.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jane
was a bit sorry not to make the trip, but only a bit.&nbsp; She estimated that she
would be basically done with her painting by December 8, although she would
need to let it dry for a least a week more before she would start the process
of varnishing it to preserve the painting.&nbsp; She therefore decided that she
would gamble on being done and arranged to show the painting as it would be on
the morning the 9<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp; She asked permission from Ms Li to have guests
in the school that Saturday, and then let Daria issue the invitations.&nbsp; She
would be spending all evening on the 1<sup>st</sup> and the morning and
afternoon of the 2<sup>nd</sup> as well as after school that following week
working on fine details with instruments finer than brushes, trying to finish.&nbsp;
The incredibly small-scale work would send Jane to bed early each night to
prevent eye strain. &nbsp;She barely noticed Lawndale's 7-6 victory in western
Maryland.&nbsp; With John and Thor practicing hard both for concerts and the
playoffs, and Jane even busier than usual with her painting, Daria was able to
work on the romance novel, some short stories, and her plans for the Lawndale
Review the next spring.&nbsp; The pair only hoped that John and Thor would be able
to make Jane's preliminary showing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jane
was forced to reschedule her limited showing from 11:00 Saturday morning to
9:30, however, when, to the surprise of many, it was announced that Lawndale
would be hosting the semi-final game Saturday afternoon instead of travelling
to an away game Friday night.&nbsp; There were only a select few invited to the
show.&nbsp; From the school, there was only Daria, Jodie, John, Thor, Mack, Ms
Defoe, and Ms Li.&nbsp; Mrs. Sloane and two other members of the Sloane Foundation
would of course be present.&nbsp; Other than that, Jane's parents, Daria's parents, Quinn,
and Mark Riordan from the law firm would be the only other people at the
preview.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria,
Jane, and a few other students, plus all of the faculty and staff geared up for
that Wednesday, expecting an attack, or at least another nasty letter.&nbsp; To the
surprise of everyone concerned, however, nothing was reported.&nbsp; There were
certainly no attacks in or around the school itself.&nbsp; If there were any letters
stuffed into lockers, the victim did not report it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The
overly mushy card that Quinn received was ignored by Quinn herself and Stacey.&nbsp;
No one else, other than the sender, knew about it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The
casual way Quinn had glanced at it and then tucked it away at first angered the
sender, but fortunately then he decided that Quinn just didn't want to draw
attention to it at that point, and would enjoy it later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The
next Saturday, Jane had set up supports on the stage itself, while Daria
managed the overall setting.&nbsp; It had taken Jane, Jodie, Mack, John, and Thor
together to maneuver the huge (78 inches &ndash; six and a half feet &ndash; high by 126
inches &ndash; ten and a half feet &ndash; long) canvas into position.&nbsp; Jane would be happy
when it was varnished so it could be framed, as that would give the canvas
greater stability.&nbsp; Still, by 9:10 the canvas was in position behind the closed
curtain, Daria and Jane had decided on the lighting, and the guests were
gathering out in the auditorium.&nbsp; John had arranged to have a large urn of hot
chocolate and cookies set up in front of the stage and Quinn was already there,
playing hostess.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>At
9:16, Thor popped his head behind the curtain. "Everyone is already here," he
told the waiting pair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jane,
who had been jaunty up until that moment, suddenly froze for a moment, paling.&nbsp;
Daria placed a hand on her shoulder to steady her. "Are you okay?" she asked,
concerned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Let's
just get this over with," Jane muttered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
nodded, and dragged Jane over towards the light board.&nbsp; Thor watched for a
moment, and left to go back down front.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
flipped a switch to turn on a spotlight to stage left, took Jane's hand and
squeezed it briefly to reassure her, and simply said, "You're on."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jane
nodded, took a deep breath, and walked out in front of the curtain and into the
spotlight, glad she could not really see the faces looking up at her.&nbsp; A brief
memory of her fleeing the stage after passing out of the Self Esteem class
flashed through her head, but she suppressed it. "Good morning," Jane said. "I
had a big huge detailed speech, but to be honest, I'm too nervous to give it."
Jane did not hear the supportive but amused murmurs that generated. "So, last
summer I was at Ashield, I mean the Ashfield Art Colony.&nbsp; I would have been
happy just doing my normal style of painting, but I was challenged to try some
other styles, styles of realism.&nbsp; Because of the encouragement of my best
friend, I took up those challenges, and found realism, especially photorealism,
interesting technically if limited imaginatively.&nbsp; My answer to that is
sometimes called hyperrealism or fantasy realism, or a few other things.&nbsp;
Thanks to the Sloane Foundation for the supplies and Ms Li for the space, I
have to able to create this piece, <i>Arena of Progress?</i>"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>After
a moment, Daria realized that was her cue, and she opened the curtains.&nbsp; John
and Thor instantly began clapping, and Jodie, Quinn, and Mack quickly joined.&nbsp;
The adults did the same, and then one by one each mounted the stairs to take a
better look.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The
foreground shaded from the vibrant greens and whites of a hash-marked football
field into the bloodied sands of the Roman arena.&nbsp; Where the two seamlessly
blended, a triumphant retiarius (the Roman gladiator armed with net, trident,
and dagger) stood over the body of a football player (in Oakwood colors at the
request of Ms Li &ndash; the retiarius' gladiator tattoo was of a Lawndale lion).&nbsp;
The retiarius' trident was clearly planted in the football player's neck, and
the blood was pooling off near the helmet.&nbsp; The back foot of the gladiator was
fully in the grass, the football player's splayed cleated shoes in the sand,
reversing their eras.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>It
was the crowd, however, that made the painting.&nbsp; Football sidelines were
missing, and the fight had clearly taken place a few feet from the arena walls.&nbsp;
Therefore, the first three rows of spectators were shown in full photorealism,
the fantasy coming from the mixture of eras.&nbsp; There were a few Romans in togas
and Oakwood supporters in full fan gear.&nbsp; However, there were also people
dressed for Spanish and Mexican bull fights, Cajuns and Regency dandies from
cockfighting, Elizabethans who would have been watching bull or bear-baiting,
Aztecs watching <i>ullamaliztli</i>, soccer rowdies in various fan gear, boxing
fans in the dress from the late-nineteenth century to the present howling for
blood, and NASCAR fans waiting for a crash.&nbsp; Altogether, there were 45 figures
fully depicted, and another 21 partially shown on the sides or behind the third
row.&nbsp; Some were excited by the blood in front of them, some were obviously
watching other combat off in the distance, some seemed disappointed that there
was not enough blood, a few paid no attention to the arena.&nbsp; Several held food
or drink from the wrong eras, while one figure dressed as a Soviet officer was
winning a chess game against an SS officer, neither paying attention to what
was going on around them.&nbsp; In the foreground, a fully-spurred fighting cock
scratched unconcerned in the grass looking for bugs, while off to the side sand
side, the upper body of a dead bear, the bloody drag marks clear, could be
seen.&nbsp; Between the bear's carcass and the dead football player, barely
discernable, was the shadow of a grim reaper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>It
was clear that a number of the characters were known to the people looking the
painting over.&nbsp; Although his face wasn't really visible, John was the
gladiator, while Kevin's profile was partially visible behind the football
player's facemask.&nbsp; In the shadows of the upper right corner, most of Daria was
visible, a Roman Vestal clearly more interested in a scroll she was reading
than what was going on around her.&nbsp; Even less of Jane herself was visible, a dozing
slave at Daria's feet, her head resting against her mistress' thigh.&nbsp; Mark
Riordan smirked, seeing his partners Horowitz and Vitale respectively as the
Soviet and Nazi chess players respectively. Riordan himself, Jake
Morgendorffer, and Vincent Lane were three of the Romans, Riordan in the toga
of a patrician auger, although holding one of his favored hand-rolled panatelas,
clearly smoldering. Thor, Mack, and a number of the other Lawndale football
players were various soccer rowdies.&nbsp; Quinn and the other fashion club members
were in full redneck fashion as NASCAR fan girls, their hairdos each an homage
to hair spray, if in different ways.&nbsp; <i>Mystic Spiral</i>'s members were
Mexican working class bull fight fans, although Trent's face wasn't visible, as
he was asleep under a sombrero, a Spanish guitar clutched in one hand. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The
figures were full of life and photo-clear.&nbsp; The characters and scenery blended
together perfectly, although of course the cross-historical nature of the
painting jarred, as it was meant to.&nbsp; It was as if the images had been
perfectly photo-shopped and blended, rather than painted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>After
gazing at the painting closely for nearly five mostly silent minutes, Vincent
Lane walked over to his daughter and kissed her forehead.&nbsp; He looked at her for
moment, placed his hands on her shoulders, and simply said, "I'm so proud."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>That
loosened the flood of compliments for all concerned.&nbsp; The three members of the
Sloane Foundation conferred briefly, and then Kay went up to Daria, dragged her
over to Jane and asked, "Twelve thousand, and your usual contract on
reproductions and use?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
looked at Jane, who nodded.&nbsp; Daria looked back at Mrs. Sloane, and noticed Ms
Li hovering. "Agreed.&nbsp; When you display it, after acknowledging all the support
the Sloane Foundation gave Ms Lane, we will have to insist on a line
acknowledging Ms Li and Lawndale High as well."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Naturally,"
Kay said.&nbsp; She turned to Jane. "We will of course have a formal showing at the
Sloane Foundation wing at the Museum.&nbsp; How does late January or early February
sound?"&nbsp; Jane, speechless, could only nod.&nbsp; This was more than she had hoped
for.&nbsp; Kay turned to Ms Li. "You will, of course, join us on the dais for the
formal dinner before hand, Ms Li?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Ms
Li, knowing the wealth likely to be represented, merely nodded vigorously,
afraid for a brief moment that if she said anything it might ruin her chances
to meet possible donors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Kay
turned to the Lanes and Morgendorffers. "I'll have a table for twelve set aside
for you to finish filling.&nbsp; Jane, Daria, and their escorts will of course be up
front with us."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I'll
take two tables of twelve as well," Riordan piped up.&nbsp; Kay smiled, knowing that
Riordan was in various direct and indirect ways the second largest supplier of
funds for the local art community, although it was of course a distant second
after the Sloanes and their Foundation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Thank
you," Ms Li managed to cut in, having recovered her voice.&nbsp; She turned. "Ms
Lane, I will just add 'magnificent' to your kudos.&nbsp; However, Mister Mackenzie,
Mister Yanuzzi, Mister Villars?&nbsp; I think you should report to the cafeteria."
She reminded the others present, "We do have a playoff game today, starting at
one o'clock.&nbsp; Granted, the team lunch doesn't start until eleven, but I want these
fine athletes concentrating on the game."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The
football players had to help move the painting back to Jane's temporary studio
off stage first, and then moved the hot chocolate and cookies to the hallway
near the stage entrance as well before going off to the cafeteria.&nbsp; The others
stayed, talking about the painting and pointing out all the details they could
find (and there were many) until shortly before 11:00.&nbsp; Ms Li and Jodie left
together to set up an article about the painting for the school paper.&nbsp; The
group quickly cleared out, until only Jane and Daria were left, with an hour
and half to kill before they were to meet Jodie in the old press box.&nbsp; Daria
opened her backpack, showing she had packed away several sandwiches, a bag of corn
chips, and a bottle of fizzy lemonade. "Jane," Daria said, her plastic
champagne glass held up for a toast, "you may be an utter egotist, but you have
the skills to back your boast."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Thank
you, Amiga," Jane returned. "We worked separately until late last summer, and
did very well.&nbsp; Since then, we've partially worked together, and done even
better.&nbsp; Now I'm not teasing you when I say this, but I really think you're
more of a muse, an inspiration, to me and my imagination than you ever could
have been for Trent."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
blushed slightly and she bowed her head, hiding her face in a curtain of auburn
hair. "Thank you," Daria replied, touched.&nbsp; She looked up and said, "I think I
would still be wallowing in angst if I hadn't met you."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jane
merely smiled and said, "I have a proposal for you."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"That's

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"A

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Lawndale's
defensive unit played their collective hearts out, but Kevin and the Lawndale
offense had finally run up against a defense that both confused them and which
could read them.&nbsp; Lawndale's running game, never its strongest point as Mack
and Kevin were the only decent backs, was held to twelve yards the whole
afternoon.&nbsp; Using Mack more as a receiver once the running game was shut down,
Kevin managed to use him and the Three J's to some effect, but his three
touchdown passes were negated by six interceptions, two run back for
touchdowns.&nbsp; Lawndale was knocked out of the semifinals, 21-18.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Kevin
was not the only Lawndale player or student near tears after the game.&nbsp; It was
clear both that without Kevin, Lawndale wouldn't have scored as often as they
had during the season, but also that his errors had led to this defeat as
well.&nbsp; Even Mr. Thompson knew that, coupled with Kevin's poor academic
performance over the years, this was likely the end of his son's football
career.</span></p>

boys left over two hours later, their spirits buoyed but neither willing to
talk about what had happened.&nbsp; They both knew what the other couple had planned
on doing and had likely done, of course, but it had been too intimate and even
joyous to talk about, not in any way feeling like a tawdry conquest that they
would ever brag about.&nbsp; After the pair had left, Jane and Daria had quietly
taken turns showering, changed the sheets on both beds, putting the slightly
bloodied sheets into the laundry, then cuddled together in Jane's bed and went

we knew the first time would likely be painful and messy.&nbsp; I'm just glad you bought
supplies." Daria said nothing merely arching an eyebrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jane
shrugged. "I thought guys that age always carried one in their wallet."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Like
I would trust one like that," Daria pointed out. "Yes, the first time was
painful, and messy.&nbsp; The second and third times less so, and somewhat
pleasurable."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Third?&nbsp;
I'm impressed." It was clear Jane was, too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
shrugged. "To tell the truth, I'm still rather ambivalent about the whole
process.&nbsp; But no doubt, having gone so far, there's no turning back other than
breaking things off, which I don't want to do."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Me
neither," Jane agreed.&nbsp; After a moment's silence, Jane said, "I do really like
John, but I'm not in love with him."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
feel the same way about Theo," Daria admitted. "It doesn't feel wrong to have
been, well, intimate with him, though."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"No,
I understand and agree," Jane said. "I'm not in love with John, but it did have
meaning.&nbsp; It wasn't just about pleasure."&nbsp; She smirked. "I think it may be more
about that in the future though."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Jane!&nbsp;
Mind; gutter; out!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Okay,
okay," Jane replied, giving in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>After
a few moments of silence, Daria asked, "What would you say to meeting the guys
after you do your coat of varnish, but no intimate settings other than on
Friday or Saturday nights?&nbsp; At least for a while?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"So
we don't get too involved?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Something
like that," Daria agreed. "I think we could all get too caught up if we do this
too often."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jane
mused about that and admitted, "Probably a good idea.&nbsp; The fact that they'll be
busy with a lot of concerts through Christmas Eve should help a bit."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"True."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jane
merely glanced at Daria, who was driving with a very set expression, more
reminiscent of her first few weeks in Lawndale than the previous few months.
"And will this settle your confusion?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
was silent for a long moment before answering. "I don't know," she finally
admitted. "It was painful, which we expected . . . fortunately for me, a little
less so than I feared.&nbsp; But as much fun as the foreplay was, the actual act was
invasive and dominating. You can't deny that!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jane
thought about that, both from her perspective as well as her friend's. "Well,
on the first term &ndash; invasive &ndash; how about we agree that I understand why you
might think so?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria
shrugged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"As
to the second, well, considering your feelings and the respective differences
in size between the two of you, let's just say you might want to experiment and
find a way you both enjoy?" Jane could see Daria think about that, and give in
without verbally agreeing &ndash; just a slight twist of her lips and an even slight
shrug.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Admit
it; you'll have fun researching the ideas!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
like researching many things," was all Daria would say.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Where
are we going?" Jane asked, offering to change the subject.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I
want plenty of protein, but not a lot of carbs.&nbsp; There's a steak place on the
way to Baltimore that's supposed to do a Sunday steak and egg brunch.&nbsp; And yes,
it's still my treat."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Sounds
