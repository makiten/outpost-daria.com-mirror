 Where did that come from?!&rdquo;  Tom Sloane banged his hand down
on the silver bathroom vanity.  &ldquo;And why am I arguing with my
mirror?&rdquo;  He sighed heavily.  <I>I can&rsquo;t believe this is
happening</I>.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>With
another sigh, he covered his face with lather.  He usually didn&rsquo;t
shave on Sundays, but he was going over to Jane&rsquo;s and he wanted
to look his best.  To make Jane happy.  <I>To hide the fact that I
don&rsquo;t make Jane happy.</I>  &ldquo;Shut up!  Shut up, dammit!&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Tom?&rdquo;
 His mother&rsquo;s voice sounded concerned.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
fine, Mom.&rdquo;  Tom rolled his eyes.  Parental interference was
not what he needed right now.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;
 Kay Sloane&rsquo;s voice held relief.  <I>There are some benefits to
living in a repressed household,</I> Tom thought with an ironic
smile. As he went back to his toiletries, though, his mother&rsquo;s
voice sounded again from the bottom of the stairs.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll,
uh, let me know if there&rsquo;s a problem, won&rsquo;t you, Tom?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Tom
blinked.  Acknowledging emotions, even one as basic as parental
worry, was not something the Sloanes did.  &ldquo;I will, Mom,&rdquo;
he said, and was surprised to find that he meant it.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>After
getting dressed, he idled away an hour in front of the television.
Jane had said to be over promptly at two, and after last week&rsquo;s
lateness fiasco, he was going to arrive at Casa Lane with no more
than five seconds to spare either way.  He&rsquo;d totally lost track
of time that day.  Talking to Daria.  <I>You never lose track of time
talking to Jane.</I>  The stray thoughts made him antsy, so he headed
out the Rustbucket and drove off.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Still
early, he drove around for a while, letting the sameness of the
streets blend into a mosaic of trees, stucco, asphalt, and brick,
wondering what the big surprise Jane had for him was.  And whether
the car would finally give up the ghost.  &ldquo;If you do, I&rsquo;m
a dead man,&rdquo; he said to the Rustbucket.  &ldquo;But then I&rsquo;ve
always been a risk-taker.&rdquo;  The deep blue of the paint was
mottled with rust from years of neglect, but he had a deep wellspring
of fondness for the car.  It was one thing that belonged to Tom
Sloane.  Not to Angier&rsquo;s boy.  Not wanting to retrace those
well-worn mental trails, Tom began to give more attention to his
surroundings.  He suddenly noticed the block he was on looked
familiar, as did the red brick house he was almost involuntarily
slowing down in front of.  Daria&rsquo;s house.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Dammit!&rdquo;
 Tom slammed his foot on the gas.  <I>This is bad, </I>he thought.
<I>All roads lead to Daria.  In my mind and in my car.</I>  He
chuckled almost involuntarily when he realized his accidental
reference.  He&rsquo;d gone on a retro kick to annoy Elsie, and
surprised himself by liking some of it.  After checking the time, he
made a quick left and began tracing the route to the Lane&rsquo;s.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Two
PM on the dot.&rdquo;  With a smug smile, he knocked on the door of
the turn of the century mauve Victorian that was Casa Lane.  After a
moment, the door opened to reveal Trent.  &ldquo;Oh, hey Tom.
Janey&rsquo;s upstairs.&rdquo;  Trent let him past and then ambled
off.  To where, Tom had no idea, and suspected that Trent didn&rsquo;t
either.  <I>He&rsquo;s really not all there</I>, Tom thought, as he
climbed the stairs.<I>  At least with Jane his heart&rsquo;s in the
right place.</I>  He paused at the top of the stairs.  <I>But what
about yours,</I> the little voice whispered.  He&rsquo;d almost swear
that it came from outside him this time.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>As
he stood there, indecisive, the door swung open.  &ldquo;Ah, on time
and unharmed I see.&rdquo;  Jane&rsquo;s voice was faintly mocking.
&ldquo;Rustbucket didn&rsquo;t explode?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Tom
bowed with a flourish as Jane stood aside.  &ldquo;My humble chariot,
as do I, lives but to serve you.  Now what&rsquo;s the big surprise?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Jane
directed him over to the easel by her bed.  On it was a good-sized
canvas, covered with a self-portrait: Jane in jungle setting with
yellow stripes in her hair.  The stripes served to highlight the
feline qualities of Jane&rsquo;s angular face, and the lush greenery
hiding her body added to her mystery and allure. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;So,
what do you think?&rdquo;  Jane asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Overcome
by a rush of desire, Tom pulled her close.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
beautiful and so are you.&rdquo;  He began planting small kisses on
her face and neck, ignoring her small protests, which faded soon
enough, and the voice telling him how wrong this was, which was
drowned out in the rush of sensation.  Her scent was about him and he
tasted her lips for a timeless moment that lasted no time or an
eternity through a knock at Jane&rsquo;s door that neither of them
heard, ending when the door creaked open and an involuntary &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
escaped Daria&rsquo;s lips.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Oops!&rdquo;
 Tom tried to smile, but as they broke the clinch, he could see the
spasm of anger cross Jane&rsquo;s face.  Her muttered &ldquo;Boy!&rdquo;
didn&rsquo;t sound amused, either.  He could only hope that he&rsquo;d
done a better job hiding the tiny thrill that shot through him, just
as it did every time he saw Daria.  <I>Dammit!  Why is this
happening?</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Daria
stayed in the doorway.  &ldquo;Sorry about that,&rdquo; she said
awkwardly.  Tom&rsquo;s heart began to thump.  She looked so
vulnerable, standing there, wondering whether she should stay or go.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Fortunately,
Jane jumped into the breach before he could say something stupid.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s OK.  You had to learn about kissing sometime.&rdquo;
 Before <I>he</I> could say something stupid, anyway.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Keeping
a smile plastered on, he added.  &ldquo;I saw Jane&rsquo;s work and I
just got carried away by the talent.&rdquo;  <I>Which is true enough,
I suppose.</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Ta
da!&rdquo;  Jane turned the easel so Daria could get a good look at
the painting.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Very
nice,&rdquo; Daria deadpanned.  &ldquo;Or is it a cry for help?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d
have to say&hellip; both,&rdquo; Tom said, the old reflex of sarcasm
taking him over the same way it did Daria and Jane.  <I>That&rsquo;s
not helping.</I>  He had a sudden wish to run, to fly to anywhere but
here, to be gone from these two women who confused him so badly.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;&mdash;the
Lady or the Tiger.  Now you don&rsquo;t have to choose.&rdquo;  Jane
had been saying something.  He hoped he wasn&rsquo;t supposed to
respond.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Does
this mean you&rsquo;ll be ordering the pizza with entrails?&rdquo;
Daria&rsquo;s peculiar half-smile appeared.  Seeing it was a rare
treat for him, first experienced at the spring homecoming parade a
month or so ago, and he hoped that it signaled a lessening of the
tension.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;This
is going to be my new look,&rdquo; Jane pointed first at the picture
and then at Daria.  &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re assisting in the
procedure.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>As
Daria&rsquo;s face fell, Tom sighed inwardly.  <I>Why do I think this
is a really bad idea?</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Daria&rsquo;s
expression clearly said that she, at least, though this was a really
bad idea, too, but Jane seemed oblivious.  &ldquo;Come on, Daria.
We&rsquo;d better go now.  It&rsquo;s Sunday and the drug store
closes at 4.&rdquo;  She gave Tom a toothy smile.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
see you later, loverboy.  Be prepared for the Tiger Lady.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>To
Tom, she looked very catlike in that moment, mysterious and sensual,
but also wickedly clawed and vicious.  He could only hope that he
could somehow avoid those claws.  <I>And keep Daria from them</I>, he
mentally added as he followed the partners in crime down the stairs.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>*
*</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
day dragged by for Tom.  He&rsquo;d headed over to the bookstore for
a while.  There was supposed to be a new biography about Stalin
coming out, but the store didn&rsquo;t have it yet.  And, as usual,
the clerk had given him a look when he asked about it.  Bad enough to
be thought a freak for being interested in history, but Tom had an
interest in history&rsquo;s villains: Genghis Khan, Tamurlane,
Caligula and Commodus, Hitler and Mao, but most of all, Stalin. It
wasn&rsquo;t like he wanted to be like them.  They just fascinated
him.  Daria was the only one who didn&rsquo;t seem to care.  Heck,
she&rsquo;d seemed interested too, dropping a reference to Pol Pot at
the parade.  Now, there was a character.  He briefly wondered why the
U.S. government had felt the need to slander Pol Pot after the Khmer
Rouge fell.  <I>It&rsquo;s like accusing the Devil of kicking
puppies.</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>After
the bookstore, he&rsquo;d headed home and endured a tiresome dinner.
He hadn&rsquo;t really tasted the food, his mind being on Daria and
Jane.  His parents were indifferent and Elsie was snide.  At least
his parents weren&rsquo;t bothered by his interest in the dark side
of history.  <I>Of course not.  They&rsquo;d have to find out an
interest of mine, thus breaking Sloane&rsquo;s First Rule: Never
emote.</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Watching
television and reading hadn&rsquo;t helped.  His mind was whirling
too hard to concentrate on reading and the numbing effect of the tube
simply wasn&rsquo;t working.  <I>Why does Jane want to dye her hair
anyway?  And why would she have Daria do it?  I&rsquo;m willing to
bet that Daria&rsquo;s never even used makeup, much less hair dye.</I>
 Briefly the Bugs Bunny joke shot through his head, and he smiled
slightly.  The endless possibilities for disaster spinning through
his mind, each in its own horrendous scenario, washed away the mild
amusement, though.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>He&rsquo;d
just dozed off with the television still on when the phone rang.  His
eyes snapped open and his heart began to pound.  <I>Calm yourself.
No reason to think there&rsquo;s anything wrong.</I>  After taking a
deep breath and letting it ring three times, he picked up the phone.
A flood of unintelligible shrieks greeted him.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;You

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Jane,

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Jane,

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Tom&rsquo;s
temper finally got the best of him.  &ldquo;Jane,&rdquo; he said into
the receiver sharply, &ldquo;What the hell are you talking about?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;How
can you ask me that?!&rdquo;  At least Jane sounded a little less
hysterical.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Easily.&rdquo;
 He paused to calm himself, before continuing in a more even tone.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you since this afternoon.  Now, calm down
and tell me what happened.  Slowly,&rdquo; he added, before Jane
could slide into rant mode.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>It
seemed to work.  A deep tearing breath sounded over the phone before
Jane spoke.  &ldquo;Daria ruined my hair on purpose.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;WHAT?!&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;My

&ldquo;My hair looks awful!  There are all these orange splotches.  I
don&rsquo;t look like a tiger!  I look like your car.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Tom
couldn&rsquo;t resist a chuckle.  &ldquo;You say that like it&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;IT&rsquo;S
NOT FUNNY, YOU BASTARD!&rdquo;  Jane&rsquo;s shriek was like a
knife-edge.  &ldquo;HOW CAN YOU LAUGH AT ME?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry, Jane.  I shouldn&rsquo;t have laughed.  But why do you think
Daria did it on purpose?  She&rsquo;s your best friend.&rdquo;  The
hiss of indrawn breath told him that he&rsquo;d said the wrong thing.
 <I>Oh shit</I>, he thought, bracing himself for another onslaught.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>He
was not disappointed.  &ldquo;She&rsquo;s trying to take you away
from me!  And you&rsquo;re defending her!  You BASTARD!&rdquo;  Her
screaming was bordering on incoherence.  &ldquo;Well you can have
her!  I hope you&rsquo;re happy together.  In HELL!&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Tom
felt like he&rsquo;d been punched in the stomach.  He&rsquo;d had an
idea that Jane was getting jealous, but nothing like this.  How could
she accuse him of this?<I>  How can she be so close to the mark&hellip;</I>
 &ldquo;Dammit!&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Fortunately,
Jane was too caught up in her ranting to hear.  Tom let it flow over
him for another minute, an almost calming tide to wash away the
self-doubt, before cutting sharply through her ravings.  &ldquo;Jane,
you&rsquo;re being hysterical.  Calm down and we&rsquo;ll talk about
this.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;HYSTERICAL?!&rdquo;
 It was almost a wail.  &ldquo;FUCK YOU&mdash;&ldquo; The <B>click</B>
of the phone disconnecting was clearly audible.  <I>Nice one, Sloane.</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Another
click brought the hum of the dial tone.  He listened for a few more
seconds before hitting the speed dial for Jane&rsquo;s house.
Letting the phone ring fifteen times was something he didn&rsquo;t
usually do, especially at one in the morning, but he knew that Trent
and Jane had the house to themselves.  The phone had a better chance
of waking Barbarossa by his table than Trent Lane, and Jane&hellip;
well, he hoped against hope that Jane would pick up so they could fix
things.  Finally, he gave up, and went to bed, knowing that sleep was
impossible.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
next day reflected his lack of sleep.  He went through it in a haze.
Returning to Fielding after a weekend was never easy; the professors
all had this idea that teenaged minds couldn&rsquo;t hold a fact for
more than twenty-four hours straight, and Mondays were traditionally
reserved for bullying the students into remembering.  Tom could only
remember the events of the last twenty-four hours and what led up to
them.  When had he first noticed Daria?  Was it at the parade?  She&rsquo;d
looked so vulnerable, covered in paint and misery.  So young and sad.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
rest of the day followed a similar pattern.  School continued around
him, while he drifted along in a haze.  Worry about Jane collided
with desire for Daria and exploded in kaleidoscopes of guilt, fear,
sadness, and lust.  There were no more outbursts like in History, but
neither could he concentrate on the tasks of the day.  Art class, the
last of the day, ended with him, head between his hands, staring at
drawing paper that was as white and clean as when the period began.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Walking
out of the school towards his car, he didn&rsquo;t hear a voice

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Anything

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Nah.
 It&rsquo;s something I have to work out for myself.&rdquo;  Tom fell
silent and Dave knew when not to press.  They walked together in
silence to the Rustbucket.  Dave&rsquo;s car was parked a little
further on.  Tom unlocked the driver&rsquo;s side door and, as he
slid himself into the seat, looked up at his friend, who still
hovered over him.  &ldquo;Hey, Dave&hellip;&rdquo; Tom flashed a
genuine smile.  &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;  With that, he started the car
and headed off.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>He
knew his parents wouldn&rsquo;t be home when he got there, and he
hoped his sister would be out of the house as well.  He needed time
alone to think, something that would be unlikely if Elsie was looking
for someone to spar with.  Despite the size of the Sloane house,
which was almost a mansion, as befit a partner in Grace, Sloane, and
Page, Elsie had an absolute genius for finding Tom when she wanted
to.  Since Elsie usually only wanted him when she needed someone to
fight with, Tom was understandably grateful to arrive home and find
the house empty.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>He
headed up to his room.  He knew he had to call Jane as soon as he
could.  <I>But first, I have to figure out what the hell I want to
say.</I> Tom threw himself on his bed.  What did he want to say?
Goodbye?  Their relationship had been on the rocks a month.  Besides
the obvious lack of common interests, they fought frequently, and
when they did it was always Celebrity Deathmatch.  He&rsquo;d sworn
he could almost hear Mills Lane rasp, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get it on,&rdquo;
when Jane caught him with a mouth full of gummy bears.  <I>Art
supplies?  How the hell was I supposed to know they were are
supplies?  They&rsquo;re freakin&rsquo; gummy bears.  In a freakin&rsquo;
bowl on the freakin&rsquo; kitchen table.</I>  They&rsquo;d fought
for hours.  At least the &ldquo;Jane Cam&rdquo; fiasco had been
short.  He&rsquo;d just told her off for invading his privacy and
left.  <I>Of course, we did fight for an hour after I got that
letter.  If she hadn&rsquo;t thought it was funny, I might not have
overreacted so badly.</I>  He supposed he could see the humor.
Snake&rsquo;s letter had been rather charming.  <I>Heh.  Even a
triple-murderer serving a life sentence just wants a little love.</I>
 At the time, though, he&rsquo;d been terrified, and Jane laughing,
when it was her stupid webcam that he&rsquo;d unknowingly wiggled his
butt for, was too much to take.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Staring
at the ceiling, he let his mind drift back over the good times.
Meeting Jane had been like a breath of fresh air in his life.
Fielding was co-ed, but the ratio of students skewed three to one
towards boys.  And the ladies of Fielding knew it.  Tom&rsquo;s
family made him a worthy catch, but his dates had all followed the
same pattern: Expensive dinner, unbearable conversation, and a peck
on the cheek, to be followed by three days of flat stares at school,
after which he would be consigned to the &ldquo;Undateables&rdquo;
caste and ignored.  Until Jane.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Jane
was different, in so many ways.  Her unconventional beauty had caught
his eye at the Zen, but there were so many other facets to her.  She
was funny and vibrant and a true artist.  How else could you describe
someone who saw gummy bears as a medium for expression?  Tom himself
was lucky he could draw a stick figure.  Which, he supposed, was the
crux of the problem.  <I>We just don&rsquo;t have enough in common.  </I></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
phone&rsquo;s insistent bleat disturbed his thoughts.  He heaved
himself off his bed and grabbed the receiver.  &ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;
He hoped it was Jane.  <I>Do I?</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Uh,

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Daria?&rdquo;
 He tried to control the thrill of <I>something</I>&mdash;elation,
disappointment, confusion?&mdash;that shot through him.  &ldquo;To
what do I owe the pleasure?&rdquo;  His voice remained even, but a
small smile played across his lips.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Have
you heard from Jane?&rdquo;  He could hear the concern in her voice.
Jane&rsquo;s irrational anger of the night before came back to him.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Sort

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;
 Daria&rsquo;s voice sounded heavy.  &ldquo;I really, um, kinda
botched it, big time, and she didn&rsquo;t come to school, and she&rsquo;s
not answering the phone, so I just wanted to make sure she was all
right.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Well,
she was all right enough to call me late last night yelling stuff I

began to well up, and he missed the sadness and concern in Daria&rsquo;s
answering, &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m

sharper.  <I>How dare she put her best friend through this!  How dare

about at the parade&mdash;&ldquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Daria
cut him off. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m going to go over there and see

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;

 <I>Way to go, concerned boyfriend.</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Yeah.

imagining things?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>After
she hung up, he held the phone for a long moment.  &ldquo;Bye,&rdquo;
he said softly.  <I>That didn&rsquo;t go well.</I>  Instead of
helping Daria cope with her worry, he&rsquo;d tried to dump <I>his
</I>problems on her.  <I>And totally ignored the fact that I&rsquo;m
worried about Jane, too.</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>He
sat for a moment, wondering whether he should call Jane.<I>  Not that
she&rsquo;s likely to answer.</I>  Before he could, though, Elsie
shouted up the stairs, &ldquo;Dinner, Tom.  Mom&rsquo;s waiting.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Dinner
was interminable.  The food was good, lemon broiled sole, medallion
potatoes, and three different vegetables, but the conversation was
stultifying.  If his mother wasn&rsquo;t prattling on about the
latest goings on at Winged Tree country club, Elsie was belittling
everyone and everything she could think of, most especially him.  The
breaking point came when Elsie made a crack about &ldquo;that art
chick.&rdquo;  Tom stood and headed out the door without giving his
mother a chance to stop him.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>He
hopped into the Rustbucket and just drove.  Now that it was May,
there was still an hour or so of light left, and Tom wasted it all
driving and thinking.  His thoughts slid down familiar trails.
<I>What&rsquo;s wrong between me and Jane?  We were so good together.</I>
 It was clear that they weren&rsquo;t good together any more, but
what had changed failed to make itself clear to him.  Not long after
the sun had set, he found himself taking a familiar turn and
approaching that red brick house again.  Daria&rsquo;s house.  <I>Maybe
she has some answers.  If not about Jane then about me.</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Parking
the car at the end of the walk, he hesitated.  He wasn&rsquo;t sure
this was a good idea.  <I>I should be talking to Jane, not to Daria.</I>
 But he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to leave.  Twice, his hand even
moved towards the gear shift to get into drive and cajole the
Rustbucket to take him to Casa Lane, but he just couldn&rsquo;t
leave.  Finally, he squared his shoulders and left the car.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
knock on the door had produced unexpected results.  A red-headed
girl, obviously older than Elsie but likely a year or two younger
than Tom, answered the door.  She was remarkably pretty, or at least
she would have been if her face hadn&rsquo;t been covered with enough
blush to embarrass a mime.  &ldquo;Um, hi.  I&rsquo;m Tom.  Is Daria
here?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>She
gave him an appraising glance.  &ldquo;Daria?  Um, no.  I think she&rsquo;s
with her art friend.&rdquo;  Discomfort tinged her voice, as if Daria
was not someone she was happy to be discussing.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Something
about her struck him as familiar.  <I>Oh, this must be the famous
Quinn.  Didn&rsquo;t I see her on that parade float?</I>  &ldquo;Any
idea when she&rsquo;ll be back?&rdquo;  Looking over his shoulder, he
thought he saw three other girls in the Morgendorffer living room.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Quinn
lowered her eyebrows demurely.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but no.  You
can wait if you want.  She should be back soon.&rdquo;  Her tone of
voice was diffident, but Tom felt a prickling on the back of his
neck.  Angier Sloane&rsquo;s boy had seen enough predators to know
when he was being sized up.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>He
was looking for a way to politely decline, when he heard a sudden
noise from the living room.  Quinn turned and he got a clearer look.
A brown haired girl with pigtails was sitting on the floor in the
lotus position while two other dark haired girls were rubbing
something on her face.  It sounded like the sitting girl was meowing
like a cat, while the two girls working on her honked like geese.
Unsettled, Tom turned tail and all but ran out the door, ignoring
Quinn&rsquo;s pleas to wait.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Climbing
back into the car, he sighed.  He really didn&rsquo;t know what he
was doing here.  He wanted to talk to Daria, but he wasn&rsquo;t sure
about what.  It was becoming clear to him how deeply he was attracted
to her, and he thought she might return the feeling, but any
discussion should be postponed until he&rsquo;d sorted out his
feelings for Jane.  <I>But when I go to start the car, all I see are
wise eyes and a Mona Lisa smile.</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>He
saw her walking up before she noticed the car.  She wasn&rsquo;t
beautiful, like Jane.  <I>No, she&rsquo;s beautiful in her own way.
And why am I so nervous?  I had no problem asking Jane out.</I>  But
Daria wasn&rsquo;t like Jane.  She wasn&rsquo;t like anyone else he&rsquo;d
ever met.  And he had no idea what the hell he was going to say to
her.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>She

 The anger and pain in her voice were almost shocking.  &ldquo;Why?
Because I moved to this town and I knew I&rsquo;d be total outcast.
And in the one moment of good luck I had in my entire life I met
another outcast who I could really be friends with and not have to
feel completely alone.  And then you came along and screwed the whole
thing up.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>He
felt his own anger rising.  &ldquo;All <B>I </B>did was meet a girl I
thought was cool, and we went out with each other for a while.  We
started to get bored with each other.&rdquo;  The last key fell into
place.<I>  I&rsquo;ve gotten bored with Jane.  We just don&rsquo;t
have enough in common.</I>  &ldquo;It happens all the time.  It&rsquo;s
no one&rsquo;s fault.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Oh

 Her tone was acid.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Probably.&rdquo;
 <I>She&rsquo;s sick of me too.  </I>&ldquo;And more to the point,
she&rsquo;d be bored with me.&rdquo;  He felt calmer.  <I>I think I
came to the right place tonight.</I>  He should his head.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
got nothing to do with you.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Good.&rdquo;
 She obviously hadn&rsquo;t calmed down.  She turned her back on him,
but he could still feel the anger&hellip; and something else.
&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m not interested in you!  And I&rsquo;d be
stabbing my friend in the back if I even considered it.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>He
faced forward, so he wouldn&rsquo;t have to stare at the back of her
head.  <I>And cope with how much I like her hair.</I>  &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo;
he said, trying to recapture the calm of a moment ago and failing.
&ldquo;And what kind of a jerk would that make me?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Exactly.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>

right, then.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Okay.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Tension
crackled.  It was too much.  Desire exploded in his brain like a

pulled her close and kissed her on the lips.  <I>Does she like it?  I
like it.</I>  He&rsquo;d closed his eyes, and hoped she had too.
After a long moment, she pulled away, but he was still enveloped in a
pleasant haze.  Some idiot part of him babbled with joy.  <I>I kissed
her!</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Dammit!&rdquo;
 Daria&rsquo;s voice was an angry bark.  &ldquo;Dammit!  Dammit!
Dammit!&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2><I>Oh

his idiot mouth could come up with was, &ldquo;I liked it too.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>That&rsquo;s

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I

another kiss.  What surprised him even more was that she responded,
pulling him towards her with both hands.  The second kiss was longer
and richer.   The same idiot part was overwhelmed.  <I>She kissed me
back.</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Suddenly

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>His

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>After
the sense of her diminished, his brain started to whirl in shock and

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
drive home was slow, and the night passed even more slowly.  After a

unquiet spirit for the rest of the night.  <I>I have to talk to Jane.
 I have to tell her.</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Five-thirty
rolled around while Tom was trying self-induced lobotomy using the
blunt trauma that was <I>Major League II</I>.  It wasn&rsquo;t
working.  <I>Damn movie stations!</I>  <I>You&rsquo;d think they&rsquo;d
get the brain dead crap out of their systems during the day and show
something decent like Fellini, or at least the Coen brothers, at
night.  But no.  They&rsquo;ve gotta show the shit that was too awful
even for the daytime.</I>  Caught up in his anger at the movie, the
cable companies, and the world in general, he failed to notice his
father&rsquo;s entrance.</FONT></FONT></P>

morning, Tom.&rdquo;  Angier Sloane&rsquo;s voice was even and
pleasant.  Long of face and body, he wore his usual suit-and-tie
office attire.  His features were, as always, a pleasant mask.  He
looked down at Tom on the couch.  &ldquo;Up early today.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Tom
shrugged.  &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t sleep.  Not feeling well.&rdquo;  He
didn&rsquo;t feel like talking.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Angier
nodded.  &ldquo;Sorry to hear.  Have to be in the office by seven
today.  See you.&rdquo;  His expression never changed.  Angier&rsquo;s
poker face was legendary, Tom knew.  <I>Sloanes don&rsquo;t emote.</I>
 He watched his father head off and sighed.  <I>Except for me.</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Coming
to a decision, Tom retreated to his room.  <I>No school today.  I
just can&rsquo;t do it.</I>  He climbed back into bed and pulled the
covers over his head.  Maybe he was finally tired enough to sleep.
<I>Mom won&rsquo;t mind if I miss school.  And I can call Jane this
afternoon.</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>It
seemed like years later when he heard his mother&rsquo;s voice call
up the stairs.  &ldquo;Tom!  School!&rdquo;  Tom simply ignored her,
hoping she&rsquo;d go away.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Kay&rsquo;s

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>This
required an answer.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel well, Mom.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Rather
than a vocal response, Tom heard his mother&rsquo;s shoes on the
stairs.  <I>I don&rsquo;t need this.</I>  After a moment, the door to
his bedroom opened, framing Kay in the doorway.  &ldquo;Tom?  Are you
okay?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>He
sat up and nodded.  &ldquo;Yeah, Mom.  It&rsquo;s nothing serious.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Kay
nodded, but Tom could see the worry in her eyes.  &ldquo;Oh.  Should
I have the cook bring up some tea and toast?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Tom
gave his mother a game smile.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s OK, Mom.  This too

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Well,

doorway and looked over her shoulder at her son.  &ldquo;And if you

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Thanks,
Mom.  I&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;  With a sad smile for her son, she
turned and left.  <I>Wow.  Empathy from Mom.  What&rsquo;s next?  Dad
doing a jig?</I>  He lay back and drifted into a light doze.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Awakening
for the fifth time that morning, Tom looked at his clock.
Ten-thirty.  He crawled out of bed and stumbled over the mirror.  One
look at his seedy reflection made him decide to take a shower.  His
eyes were red and puffy and his hair stood up in all directions.
Even his skin seemed raw, almost ill fitting.  <I>A shower is
definitely needed.  </I>Feeling like a human being would be nice.  <I>A
pity that won&rsquo;t happen until I talk to Jane.</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>After
an eternity, or at least twenty minutes, of soap and scalding, Tom
emerged from the shower dripping and feeling at least a little
better.  He dried himself off and got dressed.  Khaki slacks and a
pullover sweater.  <I>The ol&rsquo; school uniform</I>.  It was odd.
Had he gone to Lawndale, his usual outfits would have marked him a
preppy.  Conventional.  But at Fielding, with the trust fund
blazer-and-tie crowd, he was something of a free spirit.  <I>Maybe
that&rsquo;s why Jane attracted me so much.</I>  He sighed, knowing
it was over.  Even if he hadn&rsquo;t kissed Daria, it was time to
move on.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>He
ambled downstairs and raided the fridge.  The Sloanes&rsquo; cook, a
portly woman of middle age and pleasant demeanor, gave Tom an
indulgent smile, which he returned.  Tom assembled a roast beef
sandwich in short order.  <I>It&rsquo;s nice to have a cook who
doesn&rsquo;t treat every attempt to use the kitchen as a personal
insult.</I>  He smiled again at the cook and took a healthy bite
before heading off to find a book.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Fifteen
minutes later, he was stretched out on the living room couch, paging
through <I>The Worm Ouroborous</I>.  Only crumbs were left of the
sandwich, and the book was helping him calm down.  <I>This archaic
writing is a bitch, but the Witches are just </I><I><B>fun</B></I><I>.</I>
 Suddenly, the doorbell rang, sounding shockingly loud in the silent
house.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Putting
down his book, Tom walked over to the door.  <I>Who could that be?
Everyone I know is at school and everyone else is at work.</I>
Fighting down sudden misgivings he opened to door to reveal Jane, a
pleasant expression pasted to her face.  <I>This is bad.</I>  &ldquo;Oh,
hi.&rdquo;  He tried to keep his tone calm, even while his heart
started to hammer.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Oh,
hi,&rdquo; Jane replied and for just a split second Tom had hopes
that this could proceed calmly and smoothly before her eyes narrowed
and her lips peeled back with rage.  &ldquo;Go to hell,&rdquo; she
snarled and began pounding him with her closed fists.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Hey!
 Stop!  Ow!&rdquo;  Tom tried to calm her, but she backed him into
the house, the tattoo of her fists against his chest and the
hate-filled stare with which she met his eyes stopping him from
speaking and making him back away.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>After
a moment, she stopped hitting and glared at him, putting her hands on

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;How

away, as if the very sight of him sickened her.</FONT></FONT></P>

didn&rsquo;t want any part of this,&rdquo; Tom pled, hoping Jane

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>She
turned, looking like she was about to let him have it with both

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Tom
thought for a moment, then shrugged.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>They

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;So

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Not
here.  Let&rsquo;s talk by the swings.&rdquo;  She gave him an odd
look, but followed him through the house and out the back door.  They
walked mostly in silence across the well-tended property.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Halfway
between the house and the woods that marked the boundaries of the
Sloane property, there was a little swingset surrounded by trees.
Tom had played there often as a child.  Now he took a seat on one of
the swings, his legs stretched out in front of him and his eyes never
leaving Jane.  &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you be in school?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>She

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Jane

and the silence stretched.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I&rsquo;m

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Yeah.&rdquo;
 Now it was Jane&rsquo;s turn to look away.  &ldquo;So now what?  You
going to go out with her?&rdquo;  For a moment she again met his eye,
before looking away.  &ldquo;I guess I gotta get a new best friend.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>What

 Tom wondered if the irony was lost on Jane.  <I>Probably not.  In
her own way, she&rsquo;s smarter than I am.</I>  He said it anyway,
though.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why we expected her to do it.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>A

gonna have just a super time dating Daria.&rdquo;  Her tone tried to
be mocking, and she twirled her finger in a fake &ldquo;whoopee!&rdquo;
gesture, but to Tom&rsquo;s ear and eye it lacked bite.  &ldquo;She
loves to have fun.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Watching

added instead.  &ldquo;I know how antisocial she is.&rdquo;  Another

don&rsquo;t know.  Am I?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
really like you, Jane,&rdquo; he said with a reassuring smile, and
surprised himself by how much he meant it.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
smart, you&rsquo;re funny, you have a great attitude, and you do
everything on your own terms.&rdquo;  He let a little of the old
tenderness creep into his voice.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re like... from a
cooler world.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>She
didn&rsquo;t smile, but the corners of her mouth didn&rsquo;t sag and
the pain left her voice.  &ldquo;I am, aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>You
really are.&rdquo;  <I>Thanks for letting me in.</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Too
bad you&rsquo;re such a dork,&rdquo; she added almost as an
afterthought.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
know.&rdquo;  He smiled, but there was nothing else to say.  They sat
in silence for a couple of minutes more, before Jane stood and walked
herself out.  Tom could only watch.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>After
she was gone, he sat for a long time.  <I>What do I do now?</I>  He
knew he wanted to be with Daria, but he didn&rsquo;t know if he could
bring himself to ask her.  <I>After all, she might not have me after
how I treated her best friend.</I>  His mind moved over the many
possibilities, finding a number of ways that he, Daria, and Jane
could all be hurt more, and precious few happy endings.  Maybe he&rsquo;d
be better off forgetting that he&rsquo;d ever met Daria
Morgendorffer.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>When
he finally headed back into the house, he&rsquo;d made up his mind
not to call Daria.  <I>I&rsquo;ve done enough damage.</I>  Stopping
to pick up <I>The Worm Ouroborous</I>, he headed to his room to read
in peace.  Once there, though, he found he still couldn&rsquo;t
concentrate and put the book aside to lay back and contemplate the
ceiling.  <I>I can&rsquo;t believe I cheated on a girlfriend.  What
was I thinking?</I>  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
self-recrimination continued unabated until several sharp raps at his
bedroom door disturbed his concentration.  Pushing aside the lethargy
that had gripped him since Jane left, he opened the door and was
confronted with an angry Elsie, looking put upon as only an irritated
fourteen year old could.  &ldquo;Have you gone deaf, Tom?  I must
have yelled up ten times.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Your
concern touches me as always, Elsie.&rdquo;  Tom gave his sister a
flat look.  &ldquo;Now what was it you wanted?&rdquo;  Tom found
himself oddly grateful to his sister.  The irritation that Elsie
always seemed to rouse in him was a welcome change from the torpor of
the last several hours.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
phone is for you.  Your dork-boy friend.&rdquo;  She gave him snide
little smile.  &ldquo;If you want, I&rsquo;ll tell him you&rsquo;re
too alienated to come to the phone.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Or
you could go back to acting like you're too good for the world and
leave me in peace.&rdquo;  Tom pushed past her and headed down the
hall to library, which contained the upstairs phone.  <I>You&rsquo;d
think at seventeen, I&rsquo;d rate my own phone.</I>  He picked up
the receiver, shouting, &ldquo;Hang it up, Elsie.&rdquo;  An evil
laugh floated up from downstairs.  &ldquo;Hang it up or Mom finds out
about your driving experiences.&rdquo;  He put the phone to his ear
and was satisfied with the click of the other extension being hung
up.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Hey,
Tom.&rdquo;  Dave&rsquo;s voice held a note of concern.  &ldquo;Missed
you at school today.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
had some stuff to think about.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Like
Jane and that other chick?  Daria, right?&rdquo;  Tom would have bet
any amount of money that Dave was smirking when he said that.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>And
this is your business why?&rdquo; Tom snapped.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Because
I&rsquo;m a friend, no?  You haven&rsquo;t been yourself in a while.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>A
pang of guilt struck Tom.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right.  I shouldn&rsquo;t
have barked at you.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Hey,
no problem.  I know things haven&rsquo;t been going well with you and
Jane for a while, so I wondered if you wanted to talk about it.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Nothing
to talk about.  We broke up.&rdquo;  A simple statement, without
inflection.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Whoa!
 I didn&rsquo;t think things were that bad.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>text-indent: 0.5in; &ldquo;Shows
what you know,&rdquo; Tom chuckled ruefully.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;
 Dave laughed.  &ldquo;You should know by now that I never know what
I&rsquo;m talking about.  So what happened?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;We
got bored with each other.  It just took us a month to figure it
out.&rdquo;  Tom hoped that Dave didn&rsquo;t hear the discomfort in
his voice.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>No
such luck.  &ldquo;And?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;And
what?  I told her it was over; she agreed.  End of story.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;You,
my friend, are full of shit!  And don&rsquo;t hang up either,
Sloane.&rdquo;  Tom gave a guilty start, because that was what he&rsquo;d
just been about to do.  &ldquo;How does Daria figure into this?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>An
uncomfortable pause followed.  <I>Damn Dave, anyway!  Why&rsquo;s he
have to be so perceptive.</I>  &ldquo;Um&hellip;&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Give,
Sloane.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;I,
um, sort of... kissed her.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Dave
whistled, long and low.  &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mess around, do you?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;It
wasn&rsquo;t like that,&rdquo; Tom said, defensive.  &ldquo;I went to
talk to her, because she&rsquo;s smart and perceptive, and I thought
she could help.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Uh
huh.&rdquo;  Dave sounded less than convinced.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Well,
I thought that&rsquo;s why I went.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;So,
what are you going to do now?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Another
uncomfortable pause stretched out.  <I>The million-dollar question.</I>
 &ldquo;I, uh...&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;No

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Well,
I like Daria, but it&rsquo;s complicated.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Not
really.  Gonna go for her?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2&ldquo;Oh
yeah.  Piece of cake.&rdquo;  Tom&rsquo;s voice was bitter.  &ldquo;Hey,
Daria, now that I&rsquo;ve helped make your best friend hate you,
we&rsquo;re going to Disneyland!  That&rsquo;ll fly.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Look,
Tom, all that other stuff is bullshit.&rdquo;  Dave sighed.  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
only one question here.  Do you want to be with her?  If you do, ask
her out.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Dave,
you don&rsquo;t get it.  Jane and Daria were the most important
people in each other&rsquo;s lives, and that&rsquo;s over now,
because of me.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2&ldquo;No,
Tom.  You don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;  Dave&rsquo;s voice was
unusually serious.  &rdquo;Even though you said it yourself.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;What

over.  You can&rsquo;t put things back the way they were.  All you
can do is go forward.  If you like Daria, ask her out.  And if she

Dave&rsquo;s warning rode over Tom&rsquo;s attempt to interrupt, &ldquo;you
running away isn&rsquo;t going to fix things between Jane and Daria.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;I

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;&rsquo;swhat
I&rsquo;m here for.&rdquo;  Dave laughed.  &ldquo;To sow confusion

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Yeah.
 And thanks.&rdquo;  With that, Tom hung up.  He looked at the phone
for a long minute.  <I>She&rsquo;s home by now.</I>  He thought about
Jane, how they&rsquo;d been so right and then gone so wrong.  His
mind shifted to Daria, how much she&rsquo;d hated him and how far
they&rsquo;d come since then.  He thought about what Dave said, and
he picked up the phone.</FONT></FONT></P>
