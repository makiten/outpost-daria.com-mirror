<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>The Summer of 2000,
Daria is accepted to Ashfield along with Jane.&nbsp; Here, the preparations and
arrival.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Daria Morgendorffer
looked at the piles of clothing on her bed and considered.&nbsp; It was the first
Sunday in June, and the next Saturday she and Jane would be off to the Ashfield
Art Colony for a summer of what she hoped would be, at the least, intellectual
stimulation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Daria turned as she
heard the light knock at her door, which could only mean one thing. "Enter at
your own risk," she said simply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Quinn came in and
glanced on the piles on the bed. "I had to see this, because I didn't believe
you would actually go clothes shopping." Her expert glance made her nose
wrinkle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"Quinn, there are no
fancy, or probably even really nice, restaurants, in Ash County Pennsylvania.&nbsp;
The Art Colony is almost five miles from town, and the colony only runs a
shuttle service on Saturdays and on Sunday mornings.&nbsp; It would be dorky to
dress up to go to the rec center or cafeteria, and I am not planning on going
to church."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Quinn sighed and
said, "I suppose you're right."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Daria got to the
point, although in a non-hostile tone of voice. "What did you come in to talk
about, besides my clothes?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"I do want to see
them," Quinn said honestly.&nbsp; She had realized that Daria going away ten weeks
in the summer was nothing compared to her going away to college.&nbsp; Deep in both
sisters' minds was the fear that they would end up like their mother and their
Aunt Rita.&nbsp; Daria's bringing Jane's hair problem to her and the fashion club
had broken some of the ice between them, and both sisters had been, very
tentatively, building bridges since then. "But, tell me honestly, what did you
think of my PSTAT scores?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Daria sighed
slightly. "Okay, I had two reactions.&nbsp; One was that I was not surprised.&nbsp; I
think your score accurately represents your actual academic standing." Quinn
winced slightly. "On the other hand, I was disappointed, because I know you are
a lot smarter than that score."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Quinn looked
intrigued, so Daria went on. "You were a solid B/B- student before we came here
and you got involved in the fashion club and serial dating.&nbsp; If you wanted to
be, you could be a solid B+ student, but I can understand why you won't be.&nbsp;
That just isn't what interests you.&nbsp; But now you are, at best, a solid C
student.&nbsp; Brittany is a C- student; do you think you're only slightly smarter
than she is?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Quinn winced.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"So, all the time
and effort you put into your social efforts, not to mention the fact that Sandi
is, as best I can tell, a natural C student, plus your fear of being compared
to me, is one set of problems."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"You think I'm
afraid of being compared to you?" Quinn asked skeptically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Daria grimaced, but
her honesty pushed her onwards. "I don't like admitting this any more than you
do, but it's true.&nbsp; You were hyper and cute when we were kids, while I was
solitary and intellectual. That is just who we are, but let's face it; I have
always emphasized those aspects of myself, in part to counter you, while you
have gone for being ever more bouncy, cute, and friendly, in part because those
are important aspects of yourself, and in part to be different than me."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"You weren't
solitary in ninth grade," Quinn pointed out. "I don't just mean those two
freaks you started hanging out with.&nbsp; I was shocked when I went to high school
for those few weeks just how well-known, popular, and well, feared and
respected you were."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"I wasn't outgoing,
I didn't have any real friends, but compared to junior high, ninth grade was
tolerable socially," Daria admitted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"You never would
have been a real joiner, but if we had stayed there, you might have been the
Jodie of Highland High," Quinn said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Daria made a face at
that thought.&nbsp; Still, she had to admit, "Maybe, to some small degree, but I
think I would have more likely ended up shooting someone." Daria went back to
her point. "The other problem you have is there just isn't any subject that
interests you, like art does Jane.&nbsp; If there was, then that interest might
spill over to other subjects."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Quinn considered
that, and said, "Do you think getting a tutor this summer would help?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"Would you really
put in the work?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Quinn considered
that, and said, "I'd like to think so."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"Mom would certainly
support that.&nbsp; Suggest she get someone to come for two hours in the morning.&nbsp;
That would then give you some time in the early afternoon to do the assigned
work before you and the fashion fiends take off.&nbsp; And remember, if you don't go
the tutor route, Mom will either find you a part-time job, or worse, you might
end up at that day camp Mr. O'Neill has been mumbling about."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"Blech!&nbsp; I think I'd
better go with the tutor," Quinn agreed.&nbsp; She then wrinkled her nose again and
pointed to the top garment in one pile. "Bib overalls?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"Those might be too
geeky, even for this kind of camp," Daria admitted. "Still, I am likely to be
spending a fair amount of time sitting on my ass in the grass.&nbsp; If I'm out in
nature writing, I don't want to haul around a backpack.&nbsp; Those have enough pockets
to carry everything I would need."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Quinn just glared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Daria flushed a
little, and said, "I admit I wouldn't wear them if they were really out of
place."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"Well, that's
something," Quinn said.&nbsp; She went over to the bed, and when Daria said nothing,
she took that for approval to sort through things. "Two pairs of jeans, one
old. . . ."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"Comfortable," Daria
pointed out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Quinn merely nodded,
"And one . . . Daria, these black jeans are nice!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"Thank you," Daria
replied. "Remember, the main reasons I hated being the fashion editor at
Highland were because Mom forced me to be on the paper, because if I had to be
on the paper I wanted to do real reporting, and because there was no fashion in
Highland."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"I was fashionable,"
Quinn protested, adding, "But overall, I can't argue with you." Quinn then saw
what was under the jeans and overalls. "Two pairs of cut off shorts?&nbsp; And one
of them are cut really short!&nbsp; Daria!" Quinn looked at her sister with a smile.
"Trolling for art geeks?&nbsp; Well, we both have the legs for these!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Daria now really
blushed, but pointed out, "Quinn, other than that stupid play for Kevin, you
don't really date stupid boys." *</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"True, although I
sometimes wonder about Joey and Jamie, at least when they're around me," Quinn
agreed. "I hadn't realized just how dim Kevin was before that, and, well. . . ."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"You got
competitive.&nbsp; I kind of understand that.&nbsp; But remember, me dating most boys
would be like you dating Kevin."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Quinn considered
that, and said, "You may be right.&nbsp; Even if there aren't many in your class you
feel are smart enough to date, why didn't you make any plays for the older boys
over the last two years?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"I guess I was just
too shy.&nbsp; If this mess with Tom has shown me anything, it is that I am not ready
for serious dating, and your kind of casual serial dating just doesn't interest
me.&nbsp; If some of the smarter older boys had paid me any attention, who knows,
maybe I would have tried going out at least a few times."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"Really?" Quinn was
doubtful. "So, tell me, how many boys in your class meet your intellectual standards?"
she probed, figuring that would give her an insight to her sister.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"Three," Daria
replied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"So why didn't you
date them?&nbsp; They must have at least noticed you."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"True," Daria
agreed. "Okay, the first was Upchuck."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"Ewww!&nbsp; Alright,"
Quinn conceded, "I'll agree, he's smart but slimy.&nbsp; I can't blame you there."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Quinn nodded. "I can
see that.&nbsp; And to say he's cute is an understatement.&nbsp; He's probably one of the
best looking guys in Lawndale.&nbsp; Did you know Sandi flirted with him just before
we came to town?"</span></p>

things I've thought about you when it comes to dating.&nbsp; I don't agree with your
standards, but I know you don't agree with mine, either." Quinn paused in
thought for a moment. "Actually, I can think of at least four other boys in
your grade who are as smart as Upchuck and Mack.&nbsp; Still, if none of them
appealed to you, why not any of the students at Lawndale State?"</span></p>

that, and couldn't think of any other moderately intelligent males in her
grade, and so was not inclined to pursue that line of thought. The other one,
however, deserved an answer. "Mom and Dad would have a fit if either of us
tried to date a college student.&nbsp; While that could be seen as a plus, I don't
think it would be worth the hassle."</span></p>

Oakdale."</span></p>

this will be the first time I've actually tried to carry through." Daria knew
that she was being optimistic &ndash; she knew that she didn't understand all her
defensiveness.&nbsp; Still, she hoped, with no mother or Quinn to critique her, with
no one other than Jane who knew her around, and with Jane's support, she might
overcome at least some of those defenses at the colony.</span></p>

stops and lunch, they knew it would be over a five hour trip to Ashfield.&nbsp;
Daria had made Jane sleep over that Friday night to insure a (relatively) early
start.&nbsp; With a little effort, which she swore to get revenge for, Daria managed
to get herself up and then get Jane dressed and loaded into her father's Lexis
so they could be on the road by 7:30.</span></p>

of the trip, Jane slept while Daria struggled to keep her father focused on the
trip.&nbsp; The two still managed to talk some, building on what they had started at
the franchising conference.&nbsp; Strangely, Daria found herself interested in the
conversation.&nbsp; By managing to keep her father off his rants, she actually found
herself admiring how well he had overcome the worst of his abusive childhood,
and Jake found his daughter surprisingly not only nonjudgmental, but even a tad
sympathetic. (Jake was not so clueless as to not realize that his eldest was of
course closely guarding her feelings; obvious if small hints of sympathy from
her were a major breakthrough as far as he was concerned.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Ashfield organized
its summer programs into a three week mini-session (which they had missed),
followed by two five week sessions, with four two hour blocks of classes each
weekday.&nbsp; Students had to be accepted, and had to take, two classes each
session they attended, and could take three.&nbsp; Jane had immediately rejected all
the classes available from 8:00-9:45, just as she had initially rejected the
idea of taking three classes.&nbsp; Daria did not even try to coax her into any of
the early morning classes, but in the end, Jane would be taking a section of
oil painting each session as well as one of life drawing.&nbsp; She had been
considering just taking those subjects, but in the end she thought the class on
'conceptual art' sounded fun and so added that to the first session subjects as
well.</span></p>

style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Daria was only a
little less resistant to the idea of 8:00 classes than Jane, but her writing
portfolio had not only gotten her accepted into the smaller creative writing
program (which was co-sponsored by the local state university) but a note from
the lecturer in charge of the short story classes, first asking for more
examples of some of her darker, angst-ridden writing, and then asking that she
sign up for both sessions of short story writing, which were at 8:00.&nbsp; In the
end, Daria acquiesced &ndash; it was uncommon for her writing, especially those
stories, to generate genuine interest, so she could hardly resist.&nbsp; Strangely,
she had also gotten a note from the person leading the mystery/thriller genre
writing as well, requesting that she sign up for at least one of the sessions.&nbsp;
Daria was happy to comply, even if that meant going to the workshop at 8:00.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

taking the poetry workshops in both sessions, and had signed up for the
mystery/thriller genre writing in the first session and tried to sign up for
the science fiction/fantasy session in the second.&nbsp; Helen had talked (actually,
bribed) Daria into changing her second session classes.&nbsp; She would still take the
short story in both sessions and the poetry and mystery/thriller classes in the
first session; in the second, she easily agreed to drop the poetry for script
writing.&nbsp; In arguing against the sci-fi/fantasy course, Helen had pointed out
that writers who wanted a chance to live off their writing couldn't be picky
and that the romance market was larger.&nbsp; Most of the massive bribe Daria had
received was to take the course in romance writing.&nbsp; Jane would have made fun
of that choice, but part of the bribe was that the pair would be sharing one of
the small two bedroom cabins, rather than the larger cabins which housed between
five and eight students.</span></p>

in the small college town of Ashton.&nbsp; They had a larger dining selection than
would be normal in such a small, rural town because of the college &ndash; Cluster
Burger and Burger World franchises, a diner, a 'country kitchen', a pizza place,
and an 'arty' restaurant.&nbsp; Jane had also noticed a bar/club on the fringes of
the town, and vowed to see if Trent could fit it into the Spiral's annual
attempt to have a summer 'world tour.'</span></p>

1:00, Daria and Jane had checked in, been given their schedules and other
needed information, and Jake had managed to get them to their cabin without
getting lost.&nbsp; Jane had found her enthusiasm, and had picked out her room and
moved their paraphernalia at least to the other side of the cabin door while

nine foot deep, with a small window on each of the two outside walls.&nbsp; There

kitchen table and two upright chairs, two small desks with desk chairs, and, at
the far end next to the further bedroom, there was a small counter with a sink
with three cabinets underneath and a small microwave on the counter next what
looked like a small closet, but which turned out to house the water heater. There
was also a four-foot tall refrigerator.&nbsp; There was no back door. &nbsp;Each room had

feature was the three small north-facing side windows and small skylight.&nbsp; The

expecting the microwave, and Helen had bought them an assortment of ready-made
soups and meals, plus tea and coffee, packed in three heavy cartons and which
Daria quickly stored away.&nbsp; She then dealt with the large duffel of clothes she
had brought before setting up her desk (Jane had claimed the back bedroom, but
left the choice of desks to Daria).&nbsp; She smiled as she looked at her new lap

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

"A few new high school grads, but we're the youngest."</span></p>

style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"Let's just say
we're from Lawndale if asked, and nothing more," Daria suggested. "At least
until they can judge us by our work, not our age."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Although Daria was a
bit on the tired side, she agreed with Jane to walk the grounds.&nbsp; There was of
course a lot of activity in their part of the campus, especially as they had
been two of the earliest arrivals.&nbsp; The colony was home to several dozen
artists of all sorts &ndash; from painters and potters to sculptors, print makers,
photographers, metal workers, and even a jeweler.&nbsp; Their cabins were set on
east side of the campus, while the cabins of different sizes used for summer
students (and visiting artists and students throughout the rest of the year)
and guest lecturers were on the west side.&nbsp; In the center, there were the large
studio spaces, dining hall, rec center, and other assorted buildings.&nbsp; Jane was
happy that there was a paved loop road (the lanes leading to the visitors'
cabins were all gravel) around the center buildings, measuring about a mile.&nbsp;
That would give her a good place to run every morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>A few hundred yards
south of the colony was the end of one of the many high ridges which formed the
local mountains.&nbsp; The woods which covered it and ran down to surround the
colony were probably spectacular in the autumn.&nbsp; Students were warned about the
possibility of black bears, which would serve to at least keep the amount of
garbage to a minimum.&nbsp; Daria was well-armed with bear-repellent, ready for any
type of emergency. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Dinner started each
evening at 6:00, although during the summer there was a small convenience
store/snack bar in the rec center which was open every day from 10:00 through
7:00.&nbsp; The rec center also housed the laundry, a small art supply shop, a room
filled with vending machines and video games, a large room used to show movies and
house other community events, and what passed for the post office.&nbsp; The servers
for the campus network were hidden in one of the small offices on the second
floor.&nbsp; All of the summer students who were present (some would be coming in
late by bus or even arriving on Sunday) were asked to come to dinner at least
the first two nights of each session.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Daria and Jane
dressed in their usual outfits and joined the small throng of milling students,
most in their early twenties, a little before 6:00.&nbsp; As they entered they were
a bit surprised to see they were being divided between the art (about three
quarters of the crowd) and the writing students, each directed to different
sides.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"Are we going to be
the Hatfields and the McCoys all summer?" Daria asked the director as she
passed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"Certainly not," Ms
Proctor replied. "We sit separately at dinner for the first two nights, so the
lecturers can more easily identify their students."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Daria merely nodded
and found an empty table near the front of the hall, wondering who would sit
there besides her.&nbsp; She took a seat so she could easily see most of the other
tables, especially the head table.&nbsp; She would have been more understanding of
the set-up if she had known that the head table would be split up after the
third night, making all the staff and colony members to sit with the students
if they attended meals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Daria smiled
slightly as she watched the tables fill up, as she realized she was a bit like the
blonde in Quinn's grade who was always judging the relative popularity of the
school population.&nbsp; Still, it was clear that the art students ran a wide gamut,
from those dressed in a style that Quinn was not yet old enough to pull off
(even if she sometimes tried) to others who were 'alternative,' to some who
were dressed outright as geeks and flakes.&nbsp; The smaller writing contingent,
however, had a larger percentage of 'average' looking young people, but all the
rest were in the alternative, geek, and especially outright flake groups.&nbsp; Both
groups seemed to have roughly a 60-40 female to male ratio, while the head
table was about opposite.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Finally, a rumpled,
slightly pudgy man of around 22, with hair and eyes that matched Jane's, gestured
at a chair.&nbsp; Daria nodded and the man sat.&nbsp; Two slightly younger women, both well-rounded
dirty blondes in peasant dresses and Birkenstocks who were talking quietly to
each other, took two of the four remaining chairs.&nbsp; No one took the other two
chairs, but Daria noticed that most of the tables had at least one or two empty
chairs.&nbsp; Daria estimated the number of students to be around a hundred, but she
didn't try for an exact count.&nbsp; Except for the man's brief gestures, none of
the three seemed to notice her, let alone talk to her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>'So much for being

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>Meals at the dining
hall were self-serve buffet style.&nbsp; Daria judged it a step above high school cafeteria
food in quality, and three steps above it in variety.&nbsp; With the two blondes
still deep in conversation with their tofu-ladenned salads, Daria decided to
chance conversation with the male at the table. "What are you here to work on?"
she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>The man looked up
from his spaghetti, a bit surprised at being addressed. "Genre-writing:
mysteries and the sci-fi/fantasy sections, both sessions.&nbsp; You?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"I'm doing the
mystery/thriller session as well in the first session, plus poetry and
short-stories," Daria replied. "When I got my parents to pay for this, they
made me take script-writing and romance writing in the second session."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"Script-writing is
something all writers should take once, but only once.&nbsp; Genre writing of any
kind takes a knack," the man said. "If you happen to have the knack for romance
writing, and can get a foot in the publishing door, it's probably the easiest
genre to make a living at, if it doesn't drive you crazy." He smiled as Daria made
a face. "From what I've been told, the best romance writers need a touch of the
romantic on the inside, but whole lot of cynicism through and through."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>The man nodded.
"Students can't attend more than two years in a row, and have to be between 17
and 25.&nbsp; I did a year after my freshman year at Raft, and last year."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"New Century Schoolbook Roman","serif"'>"The only tradition
I know of is that when the Fourth of July falls on a week day, we do half-time
classes.&nbsp; No matter when it falls, the colony lets the staff off after
breakfast and they do the grilling for lunch and dinner.&nbsp; There's a big bonfire
that night."</span></p>

Daria's surprise, as the staff started milling about the student tables, two of
them made a bee-line through the crowd towards her. "Daria Morgendorffer?" the
first man asked. "I'm Bill Woods, short story facilitator, from Bromwell.&nbsp; This
is my colleague, John Woods, no relation, who does the mystery/thriller

good writers," Bill said. "The difference between the successful ones and the
ones who rarely if ever sell isn't the quality of their writing, but their luck
and the type of writing they do.&nbsp; I can see that you're pulling away from the
teen angst writing already &ndash; some never do, and what's interesting in a sixteen
year old can be just depressing in a forty year old.&nbsp; Get these published and
unless it really is your style, never go back to it.&nbsp; Get your name in print
and use it as a stepping stone if you can." He jerked his thumb towards John
Woods, who was talking to some of the other students, "If you can write well in
a genre, that's good, but it's tough making a living just on writing." He
smiled. "I have a number of novels and lots of short stories in print, but I
wouldn't want to live on just those proceeds!"</span></p>

Barksdale' expands on those ideas.&nbsp; The Daria in this story recognizes many of
the defenses she has may in the long run be counter-productive, but while she still
may have trouble dealing with many of them, she is determined to deal with
them, out of sight of her Mother and Quinn.&nbsp; For Daria on the school paper in
Highland, see the Beavis and Butt-head episode 'Sporting Goods.' Also, over the
rest of the chapters, some situations are based up 'Is it Fall Yet?'</span></p>
