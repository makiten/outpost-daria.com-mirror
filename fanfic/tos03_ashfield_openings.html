style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>First of all, the short story
class.&nbsp; As a class, I am not fully participating yet, as I am starting the
work on the angst.&nbsp; Bill Woods spent a lot of time with me on Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday getting me fully up to speed, and I could see some of
the students resented the attention I was getting.&nbsp; I can't really blame
them, as we (meaning just Woods and myself) are, in effect, using some of their
class time to work on my projects.&nbsp; I did learn a lot about putting a
volume of miscellaneous works together for actual publication, and I have been
working hard on the class short story assignment due Monday, even though Woods
said I didn't have to do it unless I wanted to.&nbsp; So, I've learned a lot,
but if I do ever become a creative writing instructor, I think I also learned
what not to do in class!</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The mystery/thriller class was
similar, in that John Woods worked on one of my stories.&nbsp; The difference
is mine was one of three that the entire class critiqued together, and John
gave me feedback on my novel outlines to read outside of class time.&nbsp; I
did notice by Friday that the students in short story who are giving me the
dirty looks aren't in either of my other two workshops.&nbsp; Both Woods are
excellent instructors, but I think I like John Woods' approach better.&nbsp; As
for my actual Melody Powers stories, they not only need a bit more work than I
had thought, what they need are things I had never considered.&nbsp; I am so
glad I am taking these two courses!</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Considering how lucky I was with
the first two classes, I was not surprised that the poetry workshop hasn't been
quite as good (not to mention not centered on me!).&nbsp; I am not complaining;
the instructor, Sue Charles, is also an excellent instructor.&nbsp; Her own
poetry reminds me of Edna St-Vincent Millay, and she prefers those students who
write in similar manners.&nbsp; My poetry is no more her style than it is
'poetry slam.'&nbsp; Still, I am learning a lot about form, and she is complementary
of my style if not my content.&nbsp; So, on all the writing fronts, I am good.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Two of Jane's classes are also
going well.&nbsp; The life drawing instructor has been very encouraging, and
the painting instructor nearly so &ndash; he wants Jane to try more conventional
styles for the in-class work.&nbsp; Normally, I think she'd resist, but I
managed to convince her to try straight painting just for the techniques.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her conceptual art class instructor, however, has apparently so far
been talking all about himself and his work, with no time for student work,
just student complements of his work.&nbsp; Jane seems to have made friends
with one of the students in that class, who thinks as little of the instructor
and his ego as Jane does.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>No, to your likely response to
the above, neither Jane nor I have really made other friends out of
class.&nbsp; The students in them (other than the suck-ups in the conceptual
art class and the jealous ones in short story) are for the most part friendly
and helpful. I think that is, in part, because they don't have to associate
with the little kids at camp much outside of class time (we are the youngest
students here).&nbsp; Still, I have talked with a guy in my Mystery/Thriller
course who is friendly.&nbsp; Robbie just got his BFA from Raft, and no, Quinn,
he is not cute.&nbsp; A one word description would be 'disheveled' and he also
has a girl friend who just graduated from BFAC.&nbsp; They are both off to grad
school in California next year.&nbsp;&nbsp; Robin (the girl friend) is in
Jane's painting class and introduced us to two guys who will be sophomores at
BFAC next year and who are in Jane's drawing and painting classes.&nbsp; Yes,
Quinn, they are cute and friendly; unfortunately, they are also dating each
other.&nbsp; No, Quinn, they are not the only cute guys, just two we've really
talked to.&nbsp; We'll try and expand that while we're here, but the
art/writing come first.&nbsp; So, while we haven't made any real friends, we
have made some connections to the older students, and overall we are both doing
well. Jane is running every morning and making me get some extra walking in
each night.&nbsp; If any of you could let Trent know that she doing well, Jane
would appreciate it, remember, we can't call out, other than collect.&nbsp;
After Jane runs tomorrow, we're going to catch a shuttle into town to look
around, and have pizza for lunch before the withdrawal symptoms get too strong.

off on the angst contracts.&nbsp; Yes, to say that I am pleased by actually having
my juvenilia published (and actually getting paid something rather than having
to pay) is exciting.&nbsp; I am glad you are all proud of me, and no, Quinn, I
doubt if anyone you know will read any of it, so you're safe.&nbsp; Work on the
manuscripts is going along well.&nbsp; Bill Woods has mostly let me work on it
myself and finally started paying more attention to the other students since
class Monday, so there are less dirty looks.&nbsp; He was only slightly
surprised when I turned in the assigned short story on Monday.&nbsp; He
reaction when I turned it in told me that it had been something of a test, to
see how dedicated a writer I actually am or something.&nbsp; He gave it back to
me Wednesday with lots of feedback and criticism, telling me that he was not
going to treat any further writing as that of a adolescent, but as that of an
adult.&nbsp; Some of his critique was difficult for me to read, but on
reflection, I couldn't argue with it.&nbsp; It might have done my ego good to
be treated like I was last week, but it did my writing more good to be treated
this way.&nbsp; When the other students, especially the jealous ones, saw how I
was treated this week, a few smirked at first, but one actually told me
Thursday I had gained her respect this week.&nbsp; Oddly, the guy who was the
most jealous last week, who will be a sophomore at Crestmore next year, was
singled out for special attention this week.&nbsp; He was upset that this did
not upset me in the least.&nbsp; If Bill treats him next week like he did me
this week, it will be interesting to see how Ike responds.</span></i></p>

on-line research on college costs.&nbsp; No, I wasn't surprised there, either. I
was outright shocked!&nbsp; I only did six, five that I know have good Creative
Writing programs plus Middleton, which doesn't, but I thought I should add it
for comparison's sake.&nbsp; On the plus side, between the AP courses I've
taken and will take next year, and the courses I can test out of with a
standardized exam program called CLEP, I think I can make it through any of the
these programs in three years, rather than four.&nbsp; I know right now, spread
over four years, Grandmother Tess' fund would be $15,000 a year, Grandma Ruth's
$3,000, and the one you set up for me (and may I add, since you've been adding
that extra money to it each time you let Quinn over-spend on her wardrobe, I
withdraw every bad thought I had on that subject and thank you for it) $7,200,
would there be much extra gathered in interest if I didn't use it all each year
and tried to spread it over eight years? (three undergrad, five grad if I go on
to get a PhD) Anyway, a full year at the following colleges, that is two
semesters of tuition, full room-and-board, and mandatory fees (not counting any
other fees, books and supplies, etc.)</span></i></p>

residents of the colony would grill lunch and dinner, allowing the staff time
off.&nbsp; The bonfire and marshmallow roast (no alcohol or fireworks other
than sparklers allowed) would start at 8:00 and last until nearly

several conch shells being blown.&nbsp; Once sufficient attention had been

would have been acceptable just after World War II, and they and two others
also wore fabric around the waist which highlighted one bare outer thigh.&nbsp;
One woman was in a thong and micro-top, and most just accepted she was wearing
an animal print on principle, since there really wasn't enough of the pattern
showing to be certain.&nbsp; Alison and another woman were wearing leather
bikinis, while the last member of the group had a leather top and a tiger-print
bottom.&nbsp; Jane and two others had conch shells slung around their
necks.&nbsp; All had various symbols and animal shapes painted on their skin in
reflective glitter paints.</span></p>

order.&nbsp; Short stories class is much the same.&nbsp; The professor has
indeed switched favorites again this week, leaving last week's all whiney and,
outside of class, even nasty towards the new favorite.&nbsp; I, fortunately, am
not targeted. &nbsp;My effort this week earned a bit less red ink, and some of
it was very positive.&nbsp; The angst work is going well.&nbsp; Woods was
especially complementary because he figured it would take me the rest of the
summer to complete that, while not fulfilling the work for class.&nbsp;
Instead, I would say I am in the middle of the pack, or a bit better, as far as
the actual work and am at least slightly ahead of where he thought I would be
on the angst.&nbsp; Still, as prestigious as he, and Bromwell, might be, I am

on them.&nbsp; Not anything like a guarantee, but absolute genuine praise &ndash;

scams, designed to get you to pay a fee to have works included in volumes only
the participants will buy.&nbsp; Still, not all are scams, and there are some
genuine possibilities out there.&nbsp; She recommends three (see the
attachment).&nbsp; These do require a fee for first time attempts to contribute
($5 per entry) but the fees are returned if the poem is published or, if it's
rejected, they find enough merit to ask for future submissions.&nbsp; She said

a drawing of me while I was writing on my laptop, and it was posted as the
'piece of the week' last Tuesday. (That means it will be displayed on the colony's
web site under this year's pieces as long as the site is up, plus $10.&nbsp; I
attached the image of it.)&nbsp; She and Alison are off having a celebratory

second round of a backgammon tournament!&nbsp; I left after the last person I
knew got knocked out in the third round.&nbsp; I am glad to hear that all is

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Thanks for the information on
graduate assistanceships and fellowships.&nbsp; I had obviously never really
understood the terms.&nbsp; Yes, I can see why those would be major
considerations for deciding on graduate programs, especially with tuition
waivers!&nbsp; My current plan would be to get a B.F.A. and an M.F.A. in
Creative Writing (the M.F.A. is usually a three year degree from what I have
found out, at least at the better universities).&nbsp; The M.F.A. is actually
the terminal degree in Creative Writing, but I think I would also like to try
to get a PhD in either English Literature or Comparative Literature (that
degree seems to mean expertise in literature in two languages other than
English; I don't know if I could bring my Spanish, French, and/or Latin up to
that by then).&nbsp; I guess I'll have to see if I can get through the other
two programs first, not to mention still having the interest to keep going
after six years of higher education.&nbsp; I suppose it would also depend on if
I was selling or not as an author.&nbsp; Most of the feedback I've gotten, from
both the instructors and the other students, remind me that as difficult as it
is to get fiction/poetry/etc. into print, it's even harder to make a decent
living at it.&nbsp; I think I can sell, but it would nice to have a profession
to support my writing that doesn't include 'do you want fries with that' or
'the specials for tonight are.'&nbsp; Yes, I know, Mom, you still want me to
think about law school.&nbsp; I have not totally rejected the idea, but will
not decide on such a path until my junior year in college at the earliest.</span></i></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>As for the images, those are from
the bon fire.&nbsp; The first was taken of the nine of us in our cabin, since
that's where everyone met to do the body paints.&nbsp; The second shows me
dancing with Fred, an artist friend of Jane's (we're doing a polka, not a slow
dance), while the last show Jane, Vikki, Robin, and Alison as they attempted to
do some kind of primal hop to a dance.&nbsp; We had a fun time.</span></i></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Mother, you are probably pleased
at the photos (I'm not so sure Dad is).&nbsp; Do not expect me to become 'party
Daria' or 'social Daria' when I return to Lawndale.&nbsp; While there are a
number of phonies, posers, and shallow egotists here, I am, for the first time
in my life, surrounded by 'my own kind.' If I need to be off by myself, to
work, read, or just reflect, that is not only accepted, it is simply
acknowledged as normal, something I have never experienced, other than by
Jane.&nbsp; As much as you love me, you have also striven to try and make me
fit a definition of normal which is abnormal for me.&nbsp; Perhaps, in reaction
to your pushing me in directions which are not only uncomfortable but which
have been at times actually painful and perhaps injurious emotionally, I have
in return pushed back too hard as well.&nbsp; Our dressing as we did for the
bon fire was seen here as either amusingly clever or eccentric.&nbsp; If we had
gone to Lawndale High's annual homecoming bonfire like that, Ms Li would have
slapped us in detention or self-esteem class, and we would have been mocked as
'the cave girls' for the rest of our time there.&nbsp; For half the students
who even know who I am at Lawndale, I am still 'the misery chick' and for
another third, I am probably 'Quinn's weird relative.'&nbsp; As great as the
writing and coaching and opportunity for stretching my creativity has been
here, the greatest thing about Ashfield, with all its many faults, is that for
the first time in my life I feel I can really I can act what is 'normal' for
me. I fit in, and it is a glorious, liberating feeling.</span></i></p>
