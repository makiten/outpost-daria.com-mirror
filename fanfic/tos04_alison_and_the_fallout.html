She (somewhat mistakenly) believed that any revenge Daria got on anyone would
rarely be physical, considering her slight build.&nbsp; Jane frowned. "Daria?" She
had noticed that Daria was suddenly unresponsive, deep in thought.</span></p>

to admit, while we've gotten some appreciative looks, there hasn't been
anything more than that." Jane considered Daria's sudden smug look. "Have there?"</span></p>

talk me into it."</span></p>

in a relationship.&nbsp; They are committed to each other, but also interested in
female companionship.&nbsp; Fred said they would be happy to hang out with us as
friends, or they made a one-time offer for a date with some, well, physical
contact afterwards.&nbsp; I made it clear that we, or at least I, would only be
willing to tolerate some fairly minimal physical contact, certainly nothing
that could be really considered heavy making out or petting.&nbsp; Fred agreed, and
said in that case, if all four of us found those limits good, things might go
beyond one date.&nbsp; So, even though Ted's head isn't too big for his body the
question is, are you willing to risk your head becoming his lollipop?"</span></p>

like I said, while committed to each other they also like a little female
companionship.&nbsp; On top of that, while they are out in Boston and here, they
aren't to their families.&nbsp; Tomorrow night,&nbsp; we all go a few towns over for
pizza, and then to a drive-in where we will apparently be seen by Ted's family,

that if I have some experience in casual kissing, I might not fall apart next
time.&nbsp; This is about as safe as we can get.&nbsp; We know going in that there will
be no commitment.&nbsp; I actually do find Fred attractive, and you said Ted is
cute.&nbsp; Considering some of your past actions, you have no qualms about casual
kissing, and I am resolved to at least try it once.&nbsp; Although it would be
embarrassing to make out in any way with others nearby, I think I would feel
safer with you there.&nbsp; So, we'll stick together, and I'll loan you some pepper

sign of Alison the next day, not that either teen looked for her.&nbsp; Jane decided
to chalk the experience up to miscommunication.&nbsp; Obviously, the double-date
that night would lead to nothing in particular, but Jane decided that just
removed all the pressure.&nbsp; If the 'date' led to some mild making out at the
drive-in (considering the movie line up, they certainly were not going to be
watching the screen), that was all the better so far as she was concerned.&nbsp;
Jane was a bit surprised that Daria was not only interested (or at least
willing) to go along with the idea of any kind of date, but that she was
apparently interested in what was frankly a 'make-out date' to some degree.&nbsp;
Jane was also surprised, and grateful, that Daria was more interested in Fred
than Ted, as Jane thought Ted the slightly more attractive of the two.&nbsp; Of
course, it had been clear at the dance that Fred as least found Daria
attractive.&nbsp; While neither of the two painters were quite 'hotties' by any
definition, both were good-looking enough young men, of fairly average height
and average coloring &ndash; a bit like Tom would look like in a few years, as Jane
thought about it. 'Maybe that's part of it,' Jane thought. Ted looked a bit
more like Tom, and Daria might be influenced by that.</span></p>

bathroom door open.&nbsp; She wondered if Daria would be ready, or if nerves would

out."</span></p>

couple you mentioned early on, aren't they?&nbsp; If so, be extra careful; they are
probably being very upfront and if so, hopefully you'll have fun.&nbsp; I won't say
anything about drive-ins (I thought they had died out!).&nbsp; I certainly can't,
because I (and Rita for that matter) were making out at drive-ins when we were
fifteen.&nbsp; I think your mother waited until she was sixteen before she did the
same.&nbsp; Should you eventually decide to go past necking and light petting, make
certain the windows are completely shut and entirely steamed up.</span></i></p>

The two guys are not only older than you, they are presumably in a sexual
relationship.&nbsp; That might allow them to make out with you and Jane without
putting pressure on you, or it might cause them to subtly put even more
pressure on the two of you to go further than you might plan on. Also, I am
sure you know that falling for Fred in this context will only lead to
heartache, but sometimes physical contact can lead to liking, even falling for
someone you were with 'just for fun.'&nbsp; I'm just asking you to be careful.&nbsp;

a comfortable rut is beside the point.&nbsp; I am sure there have been times (if not

the time you probably didn't either.&nbsp; Your Dad and I admit we made a mistake
when we moved to Highland back when I was starting my law-career full time;
those jobs sounded so good on paper, but by the time we realized how much we
disliked them, and how bad Highland was, it was too late and we all suffered
for it, you and your father even more than Quinn and I.&nbsp; We tried for six years
to leave that awful place.&nbsp; It was only two years ago when we felt we had the
equity to get your father's business started and for me to start the uncertain

that it is progress. Please just remember, I am not just a shy version of
bouncy outgoing Quinn, any more than she is a prettier version of me who just
needs reminders to do her homework.&nbsp; I am learning to admit I am attractive, if
not as cute and naturally outgoing as Quinn, and you cannot force me into that
box.&nbsp; Quinn is a lot smarter than she was willing to show (I am glad her
tutoring is going well after such a rough start), but she is not an
intellectual or any other sort of deep thinker.&nbsp; Calling oneself a genius is
looked down upon in this society, but I am a somewhat attractive genius who
doesn't want to get by on her looks but who is learning to acknowledge those
looks.&nbsp; Quinn is a beauty of above average intelligence, who is learning she
needs to learn how to use that intelligence to secure the future she wants.&nbsp;

different paths we need to primarily follow.</span></i></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>I am sure you have been waiting
all week to know the results of the poker tournament.&nbsp; We ended up with 39
students, 9 colony members, and 6 instructional staff members playing, so the
prize pool was $540.&nbsp; To answer your question, Mother, the game was always
Texas Hold'em.&nbsp; The players dropped to 17 by the end of the first night: Robin,
Ted, Jane, and Fred lost in that order, but at least none were the first ten
put out.&nbsp; Jane's pretentious conceptual art instructor Daniel was, however,
which pleased Jane.&nbsp; To our surprise, considering the man's ego, he took his
loss with good humor.</span></i></p>

second round, but with all of 3 chips left. He had to drop out after going 'all
in' the first hand and so placed 17<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp; He won a prize of a free
soda at the snack bar.&nbsp; Places16 through 12 each won their $10 deposit in the
pool back.&nbsp; 11, 10, and 9 got their full $12 back.&nbsp; Alison placed 11<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp;

prizes given out this afternoon.&nbsp; Unsurprisingly, since I was spending most of
my time in the short story workshops working on the old angst material, I
didn't win anything there.&nbsp; I did, to Bill Woods' surprise, manage to finish my
work though, but I didn't have any time to do most of the needed revisions.&nbsp; Woods
was impressed, and wrote me a letter of recommendation I could include in
applications to creative writing programs.&nbsp; He said, if I turned out good
enough work in the next session, he'll write an even better one.&nbsp; He did this
one, he said, to show he appreciated my work.</span></i></p>

gold medal, silver medal, bronze medal, and honorable mention.&nbsp; The revised
version of my locked room mystery won a gold medal (ok, they'll mail me a gold
colored aluminum disk that will say 'Gold Medal, Ashfield Art Colony Summer
Arts Program 2000' on the front, and 'short story, mystery category' on the
back).&nbsp; John Woods told me to send it in to a mystery magazine which runs a
yearly contest for new writers.&nbsp; He said he thought the story had about a 40%
chance of being accepted (probably with further editing).&nbsp; A few other of my
stories got honorable mentions.</span></i></p>
