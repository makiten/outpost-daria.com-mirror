were such things, but apparently I was wrong; at least I hope I am, because if

veterans had Monday and Tuesday off, as we had already been given assignments
last week.&nbsp; In script-writing, we merely went over the differences between
creating a script for stage, tv, and film.&nbsp; Since everyone who was accepted had
already had some sort of writing experience, we are to spend through next
Wednesday adapting some of our work for each of the three writing formats.</span></i></p>

adapt that old story I did for Mr O'Neill which you liked, Mom.&nbsp; After those
are critiqued next week, we will either have to do them over or will be allowed
to create something original. The instructor, Mark Johnson, writes tv episodes

hosed them off and got them to dinner right at 6:00.&nbsp; They played for free room
(granted, it was our main room) and board and $25 each.&nbsp; They more than ate a
good appearance fee over the three meals they've had here so far.&nbsp; They just

19<sup>th</sup> century academic realism and photorealism in style.&nbsp; I think

up to get us when the art show closes early in the afternoon Saturday (which we
appreciated), but, could you, Dad, Mom, and Quinn, please come up a day early in
the SUV to watch the mini-plays?&nbsp; I know that means you two would have to take
at least half-days off (more likely all day Friday).&nbsp; Mother, I will point out
that you lost most of your vacation days last year because Eric wants his hand

used the bathroom, and slipped out of the cabin.&nbsp; There was enough time for her

time and walked around the loop that circled the studios and other

to participate in the repopulation of the Earth, I can think of many worse than
Trent to do my part with, but since that has not happened, I can't see our

monopolize everything until they left, Jane and then Daria used the bathroom
and took quick showers &ndash; the day was already very warm, although not overly
hot.&nbsp; They then managed to wake Trent up by sitting him up and waving coffee
under his nose until he drank it.</span></p>

then did the same, waking up Max. When Max came out of the bathroom he was
given his coffee, and the trio managed to wake up Jesse.&nbsp; The quartet ate
through some of Daria and Jane's surplus food supplies, and then allowed
themselves to be dragged over to the dining hall for lunch.&nbsp; The teens donated
a few more of the supplies they had which didn't call for the microwave to
expand the band's in-van food supply of gummy bricks.&nbsp; After another round of
coffee, the band finally left around 3:35, several hours earlier than the pair
had anticipated.</span></p>

written to formulas.&nbsp; One club has nine basic formulas; we had to pick one,

six and twelve minutes.&nbsp; There were six in the first half of the show, and five
in the second.&nbsp; Daria's first scene was next to last in the first half.&nbsp; Quinn
was a little worried about that one, as its title; <i>The Princess' New Nose</i>

Brooke and her nose job, but set on a college campus.&nbsp; It was also one of the
longest scenes.&nbsp; The fashion club became four sorority sisters (Mu Mu Mu,
according to the playbill, and all four were in very heavy stage makeup) with
different names confronted by a rejected pledge, now cuter than the four because
of a nose job done over spring break.&nbsp; The four sorority sisters were sincere
in their praise of the Brooke character, but none of the other students
believed them, which got good laughs as the harder they tried (especially the
Quinn character), the less the others believed them.</span></p>

stage dressed in their usual outfits (they were noted as graduate students in
the program).&nbsp; After the pair had gotten laughs for the snarky comments they
had made about Brooke in real life, the Quinn character took her sister aside,
confessing her own doubts about the quality of her looks, and then, shocking
the audience with her honesty, about the lack of real value of those looks. "I
know it's shallow of me," the Quinn character confessed with anguish, "but this
is what I have to work with in life."</span></p>

her hands on her shoulders, and managed to look both the character and the real
Quinn in the eye, saying, "There's nothing wrong with your brain, but you don't
have any direction.&nbsp; So what?&nbsp; Lots of freshmen and even sophomores are in the
same boat.&nbsp; If you want to play the same games you did in high school, well,

character back to arms length and shook her head. "You are one of the most
beautiful females on campus, and you reduce most males to goo without even
trying.&nbsp; I guess the fact that even a beauty like you is worried about your
looks just shows you're human."</span></p>
