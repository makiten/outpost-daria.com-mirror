but she had apparently done a good job of doing so this past summer, and with
far more people than just Jane. "Shall we go?"</span></p>

walked past one of the studio buildings, Daria said to Quinn, "After you look
at Jane's work and any of the other oil and acrylic paintings that might catch
your eye, you might want to come back here."</span></p>

building has the pottery, which I doubt would interest any of you.&nbsp; There are
two beyond where we're going.&nbsp; One has the watercolors, pastels, and the like,
as well as some of the design and drawings that aren't on display elsewhere.&nbsp;
The last one has all the different kinds of prints. &nbsp;&nbsp;That one over there has
the large scale sculpture, which may or may not interest any of you.&nbsp; The one
we just passed has the glass and metal studios, including jewelry."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:

right hand, and they all saw there was a delicate white gold ring on her tanned
hand. "Jane and I both liked these, so we each bought one.&nbsp; It's based on an
ancient Celtic design."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria gestured her family into a
large painting studio (built like many of the other buildings to resemble a one
storey barn in some respects, to give the colony a rural look) which had
temporary seven foot high partitions dividing it off into areas for individual
artists.&nbsp; The Morgendorffers were unsurprised to be gestured towards an area
where four unhappy patrons were exiting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Both Helen and Jake actually knew
a bit about art.&nbsp; Helen had started off as an art history major, an
'appropriate' subject to study according to her mother, only switching to a
pre-law program her second year.&nbsp; Jake had burned some of his open credit hours
his second and third semesters to take two art classes, so he could sit next to
Helen.&nbsp; Although they of course knew about Jane's artistic interests, they had
actually seen very little of her work, other than some sketches.&nbsp; The few
paintings they had seen they thought were well-done but odd.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>All three visiting Morgendorffers
were a bit stunned by what they found in Jane's area.&nbsp; They could see the
paintings clearly, as only Jane, a stool, and a small stand were between them
and the art.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>At least seven of the nine
paintings, the adult Morgendorffers recognized as they approached, would have
been appropriate in a nineteenth century academic showing, not just in content,
but in quality.&nbsp; Granted, Jane's works were on a smaller scale, but they were
impressive.&nbsp; The two largest works were landscapes thirty inches high by
forty-two inches wide, each showing aspects of the south field of Ashfield.&nbsp;
The silver medal winner showed a sun-dappled lawn, the road, some figures lying
in the grass, and the buildings beyond &ndash; 'Students at Rest' was the appropriate
title.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The gold medal painting showed
the edge of the woods, shading some grass before transitioning to that same
sun-lit lawn.&nbsp; A figure was lying on a blanket, and the realism of the rest of
the painting only made the higher resolution of photorealism in the figure and
blanket stand out even more.&nbsp; The figure at first seemed clad only in shorts,
and the shade/sun line ran right over her -- she was obviously so engrossed in
reading or writing that she had not noticed the creeping sun.&nbsp; The
Morgendorffers recognized the auburn hair even before the pair of boots off to
one side.&nbsp; Both parents leaned in close, and were relieved to see that Daria had
been painted with a halter top on.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The two looked at each other, and
Jake just muttered, &quot;Home.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

other price tags, shrugged, and then raised two fingers as she mouthed,
&quot;Offices?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jake nodded, and they looked at
the other paintings.&nbsp; As they did so, both expressed their pleasure in Jane's 'Genius
at Work.'&nbsp; As Quinn did the same, the Morgendorffers turned to Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jane pulled out four canvas-board
water colors in frames, the studies she had based the Daria painting on. "I
wanted to thank you for letting Daria come with me, and for helping me out,"
Jane said. "I wondered if you'd like one or two of these, either for your home
or your offices?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"That's very kind of you, Jane,"
Helen said, "but we've decided to buy the oil, as well as a painting each for
our offices."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Jane and Daria looked stunned.&nbsp;
As Daria had mentioned to her parents on the way over, the Art Committee set
the maximum prices, and the colony would process checks and credit card
purchases (and collect tax) for the student work.&nbsp; The price on the Daria
oil/gold medal painting was $1000.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"I'm trying to decide between the
other two landscapes," Jake mused.&nbsp; The large silver medal painting was $750,
the slightly smaller one, showing a view of the woods and the ridge beyond, was
the second of Jane's three gold medal paintings, and was the same price.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Are you thinking of hanging it
on the south wall of your office?" Daria asked.&nbsp; When Jake assented, she
pointed out, "If you hang the smaller one off center, towards your desk, it
could act like a window."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

way," Jake agreed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Daria nodded. "But if you got the
larger painting, it might distract you clients."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

Jake said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Yes, Jane, I saw the joke,"
Helen said. "I'll hang this in the conference part of my office.&nbsp; I just won't
mention the title." The 12x24 inch bronze medal oil at first seemed to show an
empty beach with a roiling sea and approaching storm clouds.&nbsp; A closer look
would reveal three shark-fins hidden in the waves.&nbsp; The piece was called
'Lawyers on Vacation.' "Trust me, living with Daria, I've heard ever possible
lawyer joke, including the ones about sharks and professional courtesy."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"There is something else you
should know," Jane said, putting away the watercolor sketches. "Some of us are
tired of seeing artists' work hocked around without the artist getting anything
beyond the initial sale." She handed Helen some papers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Helen glanced at them, then her
eyebrows went up and she read the three page document carefully.&nbsp; It basically
stated that the artist was selling the original work, but that the artist
controlled the image rights, not the buyer, and detailed how the image rights
could be used.&nbsp; No owner or museum could sell postcards or t-shirts or posters,
etc., without the artist getting a cut, although of course the buyer could sell
the actual painting as they wished.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>"Oh, the figure abstract," he
answered.&nbsp; This was a piece done in Jane's preferred style of 'curvy cubism.'&nbsp;
Any member of the colony that summer would have recognized 'Angry Artist' as
Alison, at least by her tattoos.&nbsp; While her painting instructor tried to wean
her off the style a bit, Jane felt she had to produce at least one finished oil
painting in that style.&nbsp; It had been awarded a bronze medal.</span></p>

contract, Jane turned to the Morgendorffers and said, quietly enough that the
man couldn't over hear her, "If you want, you can pay me later," Jane told
them. "After all, I know I can trust you, and that way you don't have to pay
sales tax."</span></p>

surprised. "I'll be darned."&nbsp; He approached and looked over the pieces more
carefully. "My name is John Taylor Bell," he said as he looked.&nbsp; "I'll take the
figure study, but I need to bring some people over before I pay for it." He
took out a fountain pen and signed the contract for the painting. "Mark it as
sold."</span></p>

factory outside of town," Jane went on. "Most of the clay was dredged nearby,

Carroll as the first two leaders of the Lawndale Community Church quilters.&nbsp; We
didn't know what, if any, relationship the two had other than working for the
Church.&nbsp; The Lawndale Community Church Quilts are among the finer of the second
half of the nineteenth century mid-Atlantic quilts designed and made, and we
have several examples." He pointed at the still life.&nbsp; It was a simple table
scene -- a bottle of Lancers (although the label was somewhat off to the side,
so Jane wouldn't have to worry about copyright), with two empty jelly glasses,
although there were hints of dregs in each, plus six crackers on the plate.&nbsp; It
was entitled 'the Artists' Last Meal.' "We'll take it," he said.</span></p>

astounded to learn that Amanda was planning on being back in Lawndale through
Christmas if the clay worked out, as she had a very ambitious idea for a set of
