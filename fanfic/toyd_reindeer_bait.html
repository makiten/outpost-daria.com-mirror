<P>Daria trudged homeward from Highland Elementary.  It was quite warm for </P>
<P>the last school day before Christmas, but at least it was cool enough to wear </P>
<P>her jacket comfortably.  And the dumb class Christmas party was history, </P>
<P>until next year.</P>

<P>Daria thought glumly of the present residing in her backpack.  A plastic </P>
<P>snowman pin to wear on her blouse.  Riiight.  She’d be sure to wear it the day </P>
<P>of the next heavy snowfall in Hell.  Daria liked the box it came in better.  A </P>
<P>small pasteboard box with fitted lid, it had a red-and-green holly design </P>
<P>printed on it so it didn’t require separate wrapping paper.  It suited Daria’s </P>
<P>Christmas present philosophy.  Least possible effort without actually insulting </P>
<P>the recipient.</P>

<P>As she semi-attentively scanned the way ahead, Daria’s eye was caught by </P>
<P>an object that truly epitomized Texas to her.  She stopped and looked at it </P>
<P>for a moment, and a small smile came to her lips.</P>

<P>Later that afternoon, Quinn was cutting out a party dress she’d just </P>
<P>finished coloring, being very careful not to cut off the tabs.  She turned at a </P>
<P>soft knock at her door.</P>

<P>Daria stood in the doorway.  "Hey, Quinn, I got you a pre-Christmas </P>
<P>present." she said as she held out a small box.</P>

<P>Quinn’s eyes  lit up and she reached to take the box, but pulled her hand back.  </P>
<P>"You open it." she said suspiciously.</P>

<P>Daria looked hurt, but lifted the holly-printed lid off the likewise-decorated </P>
<P>box.  A large brownish - green pellet was inside, nestled in cotton batting.</P>

<P>"What is that?"  Quinn wrinkled her darling little nose reflexively at the </P>
<P>unfamiliar object.</P>

<P>"It’s a reindeer bait pellet."  Daria sniffed noisily.  "Smell that?  The </P>
<P>fragrance of the meadows of northern Lapland, where the reindeer roam free </P>
<P>till Santa’s elves round them up for the Christmas run.  It’s compressed moss </P>
<P>and wildflowers.  The reindeer love it."</P>

<P>Quinn took the bait.  "What do you do with it?"</P>

<P>"Set it out where the reindeer land.  The idea is to make them stay in one </P>
<P>spot longer so that Santa can unload more presents off the sleigh."</P>

<P>"Oh, cool!  You mean like in the yard?  Out in the street?"</P>

<P>"If you put it in the yard, something else might get it.  I’d put it on the </P>
<P>roof.  That’s  where they landed last year. Just throw it up there so it lands </P>
<P>on the flat bottom side and it’ll stay."</P>

<P>Daria went back to her room, and Quinn charged out right behind her.  Daria </P>
<P>heard the front door open and slam.  Smirking, she shook her head.  Not so </P>
<P>much as a "thanks" had she gotten.</P>

<P>Dragging her chair into her closet, Daria closed the closet door, braced the </P>
<P>back of the chair against it, and began the tricky climb to the attic access </P>
<P>hatch.  She was pretty sure Mom and Dad had forgotten it was here, if they'd</P>
<P>ever noticed, and she wanted to keep it that way. </P>

<P>A few minutes later, Daria, seated at the small attic dormer window, </P>
<P>watched her sister’s continued attempts to get the reindeer bait to stay on </P>
<P>the roof.  Yet again it rolled back down to the edge and dropped off.  Daria </P>
<P>stifled a giggle as Quinn’s lips formed a word that Mom and Dad didn’t know </P>
<P>she knew.</P>

<P>Quinn picked it up.  It had broken in two, exposing its soft, moist center, </P>
<P>and Quinn was squeezing it together again.  Drops of green liquid oozed </P>
<P>between her fingers.  Daria held her sides and tried to laugh quietly.  </P>
<P>Just then, a car pulled into the driveway and Helen got out.  Quinn went over </P>
<P>to her, apparently asking for help.  Helen held Quinn’s wrist and examined </P>
<P>the reindeer bait.  Daria bit the base of her thumb to keep from cracking up so </P>
<P>she could hear the punch line.</P>

<P>"Quinn, that’s a horse apple."  Helen said.</P>

<P>"A what?"</P>

<P>"It’s horse doodoo.  Throw it down and wash your hands."</P>

<P>Quinn gazed in horror at the brownish-green gak on her hands, then her face </P>
<P>hardened into a mask of fury as she headed for the door.  "Sure.  Just as soon </P>
<P>as I thank Daria!</P>

<P>"Quinn, you wash your hands right now!  At the outside faucet!"</P>

<P>Daria rolled on the attic floor, convulsed by laughter, both hands clamped over </P>
<P>her mouth, occasional tears running into her ears.  Down below, she heard </P>
<P>Quinn telling Helen about the "reindeer bait", and Helen calling her name.</P>

<P>Daria knew better than to answer just yet.  Helen would soon cool down.  </P>
<P>Then she’d tell Jake the story, and they’d have a laugh over it, somewhere </P>
<P>away from Quinn.  Only then would she come down.  As she recovered from her </P>
<P>fit of laughter, Daria reached over and pulled a book out of the box the last </P>
<P>tenants had left up here.  She’d read a chapter or two of... she looked at the </P>
<P>cover.. "Girl of the Limberlost" by the light of the setting sun, and then </P>
<P>sneak down, very quietly.  Christmas couldn’t be a total loss this year.  A </P>
<P>little piece of it had been merry already.</P>

<P>La la LA la la.</P>

<P>Merry Christmas from Lawndale Stalker.</P>
