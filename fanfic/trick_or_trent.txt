Trick-or-Trent

Synopsis:       At a Halloween party, Daria gets convinced by Trent to get 
hypnotized with him.  Who knows what might be revealed?

Opening Scene:  Daria is in Mr. O'Neill's class sitting next to Jane.


O'Neil: Okay class, get into your groups and check each other's work.
Now I know that some of you didn't--

Ms. Li:   (over the intercom) Attention students of Lawwwwndale High.  We 
all know that Halloween is a couple of days away and that you are all very 
excited.  Of course you are to old to go trick or treating so I- I mean my
colleagues and I have decided on having a school dance.  You must pay 10 
dollars to get in or you will be suspended.

Jane:   (To Daria) That hardly sounds like a threat.  I would do
anything to get out of a couple of days of school.

Ms. Li:  …so in other words attendance is mandatory, but don't worry
students this won't be any ordinary party.

Daria:   (to Jane) You mean I'm not going to overdose on alcohol and get
my stomach pumped?

Ms. Li: … there is going to be a hypnotist there.

Daria:   Boy-o-boy, I can hardly wait to see my peers make a fool of
themselves in front of everyone (realizing what she said and likes the
sound of it) you know we're going right?

Jane:  Hell yeah!

Scene 2:
In Jane's room.  Daria and Jane are searching her room for money to go
to the party.

Daria:          Oh, I found a quarter.

Jane:           That's good we're making progress.

(Just then Trent walks by the room and sees the girls looking for
change.)

Trent:          Hey, what are you doing?

Jane:           Just looking for some money to go to a school dance.

Trent:          (Skeptical) You're actually going to a school dance.  Is it 
mandatory?

Jane:           Well yeah, but they're going to have a hypnotist there.

Daria:          … and what better chance to see Lawndale's most popular
students think that they're Barbie.

Trent:          Sounds cool.  I've always wanted to be hypnotized.

Jane:           Do you want to come?

Trent:          Sure.

Jane:           Great.

Daria:          (pointedly towards Jane, knowing that Jane did that to set 
the two up) Great.

Trent:          So when is it?

Daria:          Halloween, at 7:00.

Trent:          That early?

Jane:           Trent, 7:00 at night.

Trent:          That's still pretty early.

(Trent leaves)

Daria:          (pointedly) *Thanks*, Jane.

Jane:           Any time.

Scene 3: two days before Halloween.  Daria and Jane are eating pizza at
Pizza King, or where ever it is they hang out.

Daria:          I still can't believe that Trent is coming too.  I just 
never really pictured him to participate in any kind of school thing, and 
he's not even in school.

Jane:           Unlike someone… admit it.  You wanted me to ask him to go!

Daria:          Well he's only coming cause he wants to get hypnotized.

Jane:           Actually, I have been pondering whether or not to do it.

Daria:          Well of course.  What better way for me to blackmail you 
with?

Jane:           Well in that case… (As she trails off, guess who comes in 
the door of the pizza place… it's Trent, if you didn't know that already.)

(Trent comes over to the table with the girls)

Trent:          So, are you ready to be hypnotized.

Jane:           Actually we weren't going to get hypnotized.

Daria:          We are going on a strictly entertainment level.

Jane:           Although, I did want to get hypnotized…

Trent:          You should.  It would be fun, besides you're only young 
once.

Jane:           Get away from me Trent.  You're scaring the hell out of me 
when you make sense.

Trent:          Actually, I have to go anyway.  I have to practice.

Daria:          … or sleep.

Trent:          (smiles) Yeah, or sleep.

(Trent leaves)

Jane:           He was totally flirting with you!

Daria:          How was that flirting?

Jane:           (thinks for a second) Well, maybe not directly flirting, but 
why
else would he come here?

Daria:          I don't know, maybe he was hungry.

Jane:           … but he didn't eat anything.

Daria:          Yeah, well, maybe he wanted to see you.

Jane:           (turning the phrase around)… or maybe he wanted to see you.

Daria:          Jane!  He doesn't like me.  (thought VO: why would he like 
me? I am so much younger than him what would he want with a girl like me?)

Jane:           If that's what you want to believe…

Scene 4:
The day before the dance.  It's a Friday and Jane and Daria are renting

movies so they're at the movie rental place.

Jane:           What do you think about "Good Will Hunting"?

Daria:          Sure, if that's what you want.  I guess I can't stop you.

Jane:           No, wait here is something.  Look at this. (Holds out a 
video tape)

(Daria looks at the case that Jane is holding and looks confused)

Daria:          "Beavis and Butthead"?  That's weird, I knew some people 
named Beavis and Butthead back when I lived in Highland.

Jane:           Wait--  (looks at the back of the video tape box.  You know 
what I am talking about, the actual case that the videos come in when you 
buy them) this girl on the back looks a lot like you.

Daria:          (takes the case and looks at it, her eyes go wide)  That 
*is* me!  What the hell?!?!

Jane:           Our own little movie star.

Daria:          I did *not* know they were recording me.

Scene 5:
At Jane's house in her room later that night.  They are watching
"Carrie" the one where they drop pigs blood on the girl who has telepathic 
powers.

Jane:           This kinda makes me want to burn down our school.

Daria:          Well then do what you want, but I don't want to be suckered 
into becoming Prom Queen.

Jane:           Lets just watch TV.

Daria:          I like that.

(Jane takes the tape out of the VCR and turns the channel)

TV:             Do your bathrooms come alive when you're not around?  
Talking toilets next on Sick Sad World.

(Jane mutes the TV)

Daria:          How come this show is always on whenever we turn on the TV?

Jane:           Yeah and what I am wondering is why is it always at the very 
beginning of the show?  That's just crazy if you ask me.

Daria:          Insane.

Jane:           My guess is that everything in our world is being planed and 
recorded.  Yeah, we're just little cartoon people that are sent out to some 
TV station and aired to people every Wednesday at 10:00.

Daria:          Nine central.  We truly live in a sick sad world.

Scene 6:
The next morning.  Jane and Daria are asleep.  It is about 10:30 in the

morning.  They are soon awaken by Trent and his lovely band who were
practicing early, or late…  whatever.

Jane:           (sounding angry) Good thing I don't need to waste my money 
on an

alarm clock.

Daria:          (who isn't really awake) huh?  Right…

Jane:           I'm going to tell Trent to shut up.

Daria:          Uh huh.

Jane:           … and I am going to tell him that you are wild about him.

Daria:          Okay… whatever… just close the door okay?

Jane:           Um hmm.  (Turns to leave the room)

Daria:          (finally waking up) wait!  I didn't mean that…

Jane:           Hmm…

Daria:          I'm coming with.

Jane:           I wonder why? (she trails off)

Daria and Jane walk down to the basement where the Mystic Spiral
occupy.

Jane:           Trent, shut up!

Trent:          (sees Jane and immediately feels sorry for what he's done.  
He sees Daria and feels *really* guilty that he woke her up) Oh, um sorry 
Daria… Jane.

Jane:           Yeah, um, you should be.

Jesse:          (not really getting what's going on) what are you guys doing 
up so early?

Scene 7:
Later that day.  About 12:30 the girls are eating macaroni.  They are
still at the Lane's house and the Mystic Spiral has gone out to eat.

Jane:           I don't really get you.

Daria:          What do you mean… (Thinks about it for a second but she
obviously knew what she meant) do you mean about Trent?

Jane:           Yeah, I mean it's so obvious that you are in love with him 
yet you just decide that you should watch from a safe distance.

Daria:          How come almost every time I talk to you Trent is in the 
conversation one way or another?

Jane:           I think that you know why.

Daria:          Well… (sounds curious) do you really think that he likes me?

Jane:           Yeah.  Oh make that a hell yeah!

Daria:          I don't understand though.  You say that he doesn't really 
have trouble when it comes to asking girls out.

Jane:           Well he didn't, until you came along.

Daria:          …and that means?

Jane:           That he used to go out with every girl and her sister before 
you came along and now, well it seems as though he is trying to, well, stay 
single
for the right girl… the right girl being you of course.

Daria:          Well…

Jane:           I mean, I have known you for how long now?

Daria:          Almost a year.

Jane:           Yeah and Trent hasn't gone out on a single date.  Well at 
least since you got your belly button pierced I think.

Daria:          (Smiles) So you think…

Jane:           Yeah.  Listen, if you want, I can ask Jesse later if Trent 
has feelings for you.  He might know.

Daria:          (enthusiastic) Okay.

Scene 8:
About 7:00.  The girls are ready and they are waiting for Trent to get
ready so they can take off to the dance.

Jane:           (annoyed that she has to wait for Trent) How long do you 
think this is going to take?

Daria:          I don't know.  So… um… did you…

Jane:           Ask Jesse?

Daria:          Yeah.

Jane:           Sorry, but no.  I have been with you all afternoon.

Daria:          Yeah well I was sorta hoping you called him while I was in 
the bathroom or something.

(Trent enters the room)

Trent:          You guys ready?

Jane:           Rarin'

(They head out to the car)

Jane:           Daria, why don't you take shotgun.  I have to do my nail 
polish and you know how that smells.

Daria:          (pointedly) Like a rat.

(As they approach the school you see little kids in their Barney
costumes and what not, then they arrive in the school parking lot and get a 
space the three then walk into the school building and into the gym where 
the dance is being held.  The room is decorated with crepe paper so they gym 
looks really cheaply decorated.   Needless to say there is a hypnotist who 
is ready to take volunteers.)

Hypnotist:      Quiet down ladies and gentleman. My name is Randy and I am 
your hypnotist for the evening.

Daria:          (to Jane) Are you ready for the greatest show on earth?

Randy:  Do we have any volunteers.

(Countless hands go up including Trent's as Randy searches the audience
for
a volunteer.  He selects Brittany and Sandi.)

Randy:  Come on up girls. (He motions with his hand to have the girls
get onto the stage.  The two go onto stage looking excited) Okay girls.
Prepare to be put into a trance, but before that can you tell me your names?

Sandi:          I am Sandi, President of the Fashion Club.

Brittany:       I am Brittany!  Give me a B-R-I-T--

Randy:  That's enough.

(Randy does several things to make Sandi and Brittany go into a trance)

Randy:  (talks softly to the audience) what should we have them do?

Quinn:  Make Sandi think she's a slug!  (To Stacy) Slugs *aren't* cute.

Randy:  Okay, Sandi, when I snap my fingers you will think that your are
a tiny gross little slug.

(Cut to Quinn looking happy)

*Snap* Sandi wakes up.

Sandi:          (doesn't say anything she just gets onto the floor and 
crawls around.)

Randy:  (a couple minutes later Randy realizes that since she isn't
really doing anything then she should be taken out of her trance) Right, 
Sandi

*snap* you are now back to normal.

Sandi:          Right, I am going to sit down now.

Randy:  Okay, now what should we do to Brittany?

Kevin:  (To Mack) I've done a couple things to Brittany if you catch my
drift, Mack Daddy.

Mack:           If you call me that again I will give you a reason to wear 
those

stupid shoulder pads *all* the time!

Girl:           Make her think that she is a dinosaur!

Daria:          (to Jane) Why did I think this would be more interesting?

Randy:  Brittany, at the snap of my fingers you will think that you are
a T-Rex.  You are hungry and looking for food.  *Snap*

Brittany:       (waking up and her eyes narrowing as she runs at Randy
trying to eat him)  Roarrrrrrrr.

Daria:          (to Jane) Why did I come here?

Jane:           I think that we both know why…

Randy:  (try's to fight Brittany off) Brittany.  You aren't a dinosaur.
*Snap*

Brittany:       (awakens on top of Randy in a rather compromising situation) 
Oh, sorry.  (She sees Kevin)  Kevie I didn't do anything that time.  I 
*swear* it!

(Kevin leaves the gym thinking Brittany was cheating on him)

Randy:  Any other volunteers?

(Everybody didn't really like what they saw so those who wanted to go
up before didn't raise their hands again.  Well Trent did though…)

Randy:  You there and bring one of your friends up with.  (Points to
Trent)

Trent:          Daria, do you want to come up there with me?

Daria:          Um, no not really.

Trent:          Come on Daria.  This will be fun.  You don't want to miss 
out do you?

Daria:          (gives in) I guess not.

(With that Daria and Trent walk onto the stage)

Randy:  Names?

Daria:          Daria.

Trent:          Trent.

Randy:  Okay you two.  Get ready to be hypnotized.

Daria:          (Deadpan) I tremble with excitement and anticipation.

(Randy once again puts the two in a trance)

Randy:  Okay, does anyone have an idea for what they should do?

Jane:           (smirks) Make them think that they are going out!

Randy:  Okay.  Now when I snap my fingers the two of you will be all
over each other.  Of course you won't do anything *stupid* I'm sure.

*Snap*

Daria:          (walks over to Trent and sits on his lap) Hey Trent.

Trent:          (smiles) Hi Daria.  (He leans over and kisses her until they 
begin to really start to make out)

Guy:            Get a room!

Trent and Daria are still kissing while they get various comments like
the one above until Randy moves the two back to their original places.

Randy:  When I snap my fingers you will be out of your trance and not
remember what happened.

*Snap*

Daria:          (waking up) What happened.

Randy:  I'm sure you will hear all about it on Monday.

Trent and Daria get back into the audience seemingly clueless about
what happened.

Jane:           How are you guys?

Daria:          Fine, what exactly did I do up there.

Jane:           Well, I could tell you or we could buy the tape of what
happened.

Daria:          They recorded us!  I am feeling very violated.

Jane:           Believe me, you'll like it.

(After various others are hypnotized the three decide on going home.)

Scene 9???
In Trent's car later after the party.  Daria is in front with Trent and
Jane is in back alone.

Daria:          I don't really get what all the hype was about going to this 
party.  It isn't like anyone did anything *really* foolish.

Jane:           (smirks) yeah, nobody…

(They arrive at Daria's house and Daria gets out of the car.  She walks
into her house and goes into her room.)

Daria:          (thought VO) I wonder what exactly happened.

Scene 10:
A couple of weeks later.  The tapes of the dance have been made and
sold to the students.  Jane bought a copy and invited Daria over to watch 
it. She Daria, Trent, and Jesse are around the TV.

TV [Brittany]: (Shows Brittany) Roarrrrrrrr.

Daria:          Well I remember that…

Jane:           (sees the two getting on stage) Oh, there you are!

TV [Randy]:     Okay you two.  Get ready to be hypnotized.

(Show Randy putting Daria and Trent into a trance and then the TV cuts
to the part where they are taking ideas from the audience)

TV [Jane]:      Make them think that they are going out!

Daria:          (to Jane) I don't *believe* you.  (Thought VO) Oh please 
don't take her suggestion, oh please, oh please…

TV [Randy]:     Okay.  Now when I snap my fingers the two of you will be
all over each other.  Of course you won't do anything *stupid* I'm sure.

Daria:          (thought VO) Oh, please don't let me do anything stupid.

(Needless to say the tape shows what happened and Daria gets very red
in the face)

Daria:          (to Trent) umm… Sorry

Trent:          That's okay.  You didn't know what you were doing.

Daria:          Oh, let this be over soon.

(Trent does his little laugh/cough thing while Daria looks down to the
floor.)

TV [Randy]:     When I snap my fingers you will be out of your trance and 
not remember what happened.


Daria:          (thought VO) Oh, thank God. (Out loud and nervous)  Well 
that's all that I needed to see.  I have to get home.  I have a test 
tomorrow.

Jane:           See ya.  Do you want Trent to give you a ride?

Daria:          No, thanks.  It's nice out.  (show outside where there is 
thunder lightening and rain)(She heads for the door and leaves without 
saying "good-bye")

(Cut to outside where Daria is walking in the rain)
(Cut back to Trent, Jane and Jesse.)

Trent:          Hey, Jesse, wanna go practice or something.

Jesse:          Sure…

Jane:           (thought VO) I wonder what they are going to talk about?

(Cut to the basement, Trent and Jesse are getting their stuff ready.
Jane
is standing behind the door at the top of the stairs so she can hear
them)

Trent:          Hey Jesse, can I tell you something?

Jesse:          Sure.

Trent:          … but you can't tell anyone.

Jesse:          Okay.  You have my word.

Trent:          I wasn't really hypnotized.

(Show Jane with her eyes wide open)

Cut to showing makeovers and credits while playing "Kiss Me" by
Sixpence, None the Richer.
