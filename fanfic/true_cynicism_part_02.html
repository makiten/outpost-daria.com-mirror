<div align="CENTER"><b>CHAPTER 2 - A View to a Spill</b><p></div>
<div>Daria whistled quietly as she approached Lawndale High.  This early there
was still a chill to the air that made the physical effort of their brisk walk
refreshing. Jane, walking beside her, looked at her friend with puzzlement:
Daria happy was a rare event, Daria happy on the way to school even less common,
and Daria whistling was unprecedented.<p>"God, you're cheerful today.  Quinn
kidnapped by aliens or something?"<p>Daria stopped whistling, suddenly
self-conscious, and looked at her friend.  She couldn't tell her how good it
felt to finally be doing something useful with her life, not without having to
provide an explanation she wasn't allowed to give.<p>"No.  No aliens.  It's
just such a lovely day, and it's going to be even better later."<p>"Huh?  In
case you've forgotten, amiga, we're on our way to school.  Better is not in the
cards, merely another wasted day listening to clueless teachers recite
propaganda even they don't believe."<p>"No longer, at least for me.  Today I
start an independent study project.  No more formal classes.  I just have to
turn in papers and other assignments, and otherwise work on what I
want."<p>"Right.  And I've been elected Pope.  You're confusing last night's
dreams with reality."<p>"Heh.  You'll see.  Or rather, you won't see me in any
classes."<p>"So, if you're going over the wall, can I come?"  Jane asked, in a
more serious tone.<p>Daria looked at her friend, and answered with honest
regret. "Sorry, Ms. Li's going to be watching me like a hawk.  She made it clear
I had to go solo on this.  Maybe I can bring her around later."<p>"How long's
this project going to last? And why is this the first I've heard of it?"<p>"I'm
not sure, maybe the rest of the year, and I only found out about it yesterday,
when you were away on the museum trip.  How was it, anyway?"<p>"Not as good as
I'd hoped.  Their idea of art doesn't include anything from the twentieth
century, and the museum isn't big enough to be able to afford anything good from
earlier times, so it was all rather mediocre." Jane accepted the change of
subject, but didn't try to continue the conversation.  The two walked on in
silence until they reached the school.<p>They turned, walking around the
traffic circle in front of the main entrance.  Daria reached into the pocket of
her green jacket and pulled out her watch, thinking that she really needed to
fix the strap someday.<p>"I'm running a bit late.  I've got to catch Ms. Li
before first period to do some paperwork.  I'll see you when school gets
out."<p>"What, no rooftop escape during study hall?" Jane tried for a light,
teasing, tone, but succeeded only in sounding lonely.<p>This was becoming
awkward.  Daria couldn't tell Jane the truth, and she hated having to lie to her
friend, but if she was going to go through with it, that was part of the cost. 
<p>"No, I'm pretty sure my whole day's already booked."<p>"And you consider
this an improvement?"<p>"Well, I won't know for sure until I try, but it seems
like it ought to be.  Anyway, catch you later."<p>Daria waved to Jane, as she
turned and knocked on the Principal's door.  When Ms. Li responded, she opened
the door and walked in.<p>Angela Li, principal of Lawndale High, sat behind her
desk, wearing her typical gray business suit. Her face usually held a severe,
disapproving look when Daria encountered her, but today she actually smiled as
Daria entered the office and took a seat before the desk.<p>"Good morning, Ms.
Morgendorffer.  Are you still interested in being my Aide?"<p>"Yep.  What do I
need to do?"<p>"Well, there's a stack of paperwork.  Once we get that out of
the way, I'm going to take you down to one of our other facilities where you'll
get your orientation and some initial training.  You'll be going there yourself
for a few weeks.  Mostly it's to learn what we do, and the tools and processes
we use to do it.  There'll also be some basic self-defense skills training.  You
shouldn't ever need to use it, but it's a requirement."<p>"Um, self defense? 
Like Judo?  I've taken a basic self-defense class, but I wasn't good at
it."<p>"I know, but we have very experienced instructors, and you'll learn
better with one-on-one training.  It also includes more lethal skills than your
self-defense class did."<p>Daria scowled. "Lethal?  I don't like the sound of
that.  Why does an aide need to know how to kill?"<p>"As I said, you should
never need to use it.  But, just because I can't foresee a situation that would
require it, doesn't mean one won't occur. If it comes down to you or them, I
want you to be the one standing when it's over.  This isn't a game, and the
other people aren't very nice. If this is all sounding too real, you can still
change your mind."<p>"No... I'm still interested. I knew it wasn't a game when
I accepted your offer."<p>"Good, then let's get started on this pile of
paper."<p>Outside the door, Jane straightened up and walked away with a frown
on her face.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>Daria stood in the middle of the operations center, watching her team as
they monitored agents around the world.  Unlike the first time she'd seen this
room, today she knew what every station was doing.  It was her first day acting
as supervisor, and even though she'd trained for weeks, and could recite the
routine in her sleep, her nerves were strained to the breaking point.  As Ms.
Li's aide, she was responsible for handling routine problems, and notifying Ms.
Li when a problem wasn't "routine".  A mistake could not only compromise a
mission that may have taken months of preparation, it could cost the agents
involved their lives.  Her only reassurance was that her predecessor, who was
now engaged in a detailed study of plumbing near the south pole, had managed to
do the job for over a year without killing anyone.<p>"Ma'am?"  Brian, near the
door, called.  It took Daria a moment to realize that she was being
addressed.<p>"Just call me Daria, Brian, I'm too young to be a 'Ma'am' yet. 
What's up?"<p>"Agent Glasscutter in DC just pushed the panic button."<p>"What
kind of codename is 'glasscutter'?  No, never mind, what's his
situation?"<p>"Glasscutter's a cat burglar, I think the name's due to that,
although it's also a play on the name of a famous Japanese sword.  Anyway, she
was spotted leaving the German embassy, and they're tailing her car.  We can't
do anything overt because they're allies, and we can't let them know she's
ours."<p>"Let's see the map."<p>Brian brought up a detailed street map on one
of the monitors, with a moving indicator for one vehicle.  Daria looked
closely.<p>"That's a commercial district.  Do we have anyone down there who
could stage an accident to cut off the pursuers?"<p>"We've got two teams
enroute, but it will be at least ten minutes before the first is in position,
that's too long."<p>"Yeah, the Germans are probably moving their own backups
in, too.  Hmm.  Can she abandon the car and hop on a Metra train?  If we time it
right, they won't be able to board the same train, and she can lose them at the
next station.  Once she's clear, one of the backup teams can pick her
up."<p>Brian thought, bringing up a train schedule on a second monitor. 
<p>"That should work.  Team two is in the right place, but the schedule looks
tight.  We need to tell her 'go' now or she'll miss the train."<p>Daria
thought, briefly, then nodded decisively. "Tell her 'go', then."<p>"Yes Ma'am,
I mean Daria."  He turned to the screen, and began to issue directions into his
microphone in a low voice.  Daria unconsciously wiped the sweat from her
forehead, as she looked around the room to see if anything else needed
attention.  Only ten minutes, and she'd already had to deal with an incident. 
No wonder Ms. Li had headaches.  Brian turned back to her.<p>"Everything's
moving.  Now we wait five minutes to see if the car makes it to the station on
time, and another ten before we'll get a pickup confirmation from team
two."<p>Brian turned back to the map, with Daria looking closely over his
shoulder.  She stood, barely moving for fifteen minutes, until Brian looked up
again.<p>"The backup unit just called in.  They've got her, and the package,
and there's no sign of the Germans.  It looks like we're clear." She nodded, and
he turned back to his displays, chattering happily with the team about their
next move.<p>In her office, Ms. Li pressed a key, and the view from the closed
circuit camera disappeared from her laptop's screen.  She couldn't have planned
a better test of her new aides judgment if she'd wanted to:  clear-headed under
pressure, no wasted effort, and as close to an optimal solution as could be
hoped for given the situation.  It had taken Perkins over a month to become that
comfortable handling snafus, and since they averaged several per day, it had
been a very long month for her.  But it looked like she could get back to work
on the school budget, and trust Daria to yell for help when she needed it. 
Maybe she'd actually get a decent night's sleep tonight.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>Daria and Jane turned out of the school drive, walking towards the setting
sun.  Jane thought Daria looked exhausted, and she could smell the odor of stale
sweat.<p>"Hey, you run a marathon today, or what?"<p>"No," Daria replied, in a
tired monotone.<p>"So, you must be trying out for football
then."<p>"Sure."<p>"Um, Daria, are you even listening to me?"<p>Daria looked
over at her.  "Of course I am Jane.  I'm just tired."<p>"Rough day of
independent study, huh?  I haven't seen too much of you the last few weeks, but
you've never looked like this.  What's up?"<p>Daria was quiet, apparently
thinking.  Jane turned an exasperated look on her friend.<p>"Well, talk to me,
or am I alone here and just hallucinating that you're with me?"<p>"If you were
hallucinating, I'd probably be more awake."<p>"True.  So, tell me about your
day."<p>"Nothing much to tell.  Hitting the books.  Sometimes they hit back. 
Today was like that."<p>Jane, surprised, looked closely at her, but detected no
humor. <p>"Daria, that isn't even a good evasion."<p>"Yeah, but I'm too tired
to make up a believable lie, and I don't want to lie to you anyway.  But I can't
tell you what I've been doing.  Just let it go, huh?"  She ended on a rather
plaintive note, which did not sound at all like the Daria Jane was used
to.<p>"Are you in some kind of trouble?  Is Ms. Li threatening you
somehow?"<p>Daria stopped, apparently surprised.  "No, nothing like that!  Work
was just harder than I expected today, okay?"  She began to walk
again.<p>"Work?"  Jane inquired.<p>"Schoolwork."<p>"Yeah, right.  Whatever
you're up to, I hope you know what you're doing.  But from the outside, it looks
like you're headed for a coronary before you're twenty.  Well, if I can't help
you do it, and you won't talk to me about it, at least I can help you forget it.
There was a Sick, Sad, World marathon last weekend that you missed when you
disappeared on one of your 'research trips', and I taped it.  Want to watch five
hours of senseless human behavior?"<p>Daria smiled.  "Jane, you're a beacon of
insanity in an world that's all too real.  Lead on, I could use some senseless
behavior right now."<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>Daria walked briskly into the Principal's office, closing the door behind
her, and took a seat.<p>"You wanted to see me, Angela?"<p>Ms. Li spoke without
looking up from the keyboard of her computer.  "Yes.  I'll be right with you
Daria, I just need to send this off first."  She typed for a couple of minutes,
and Daria took the opportunity to relax, staring up at the ceiling without
thinking about anything in particular.<p>"There, that's done," Ms. Li said,
with an air of satisfaction.  "No more budget work for another month at least. 
I can actually relax this weekend.  Maybe I'll read a book."<p>"Books.  I used
to read books.  Do they still print them?" Daria asked, tiredly.<p>"You're
really beat, aren't you?"<p>"Just a little."<p>"Hmph.  Don't try to fool me. 
In the past four days you've had to call me exactly once.  You've handled
fifteen incidents yourself, and handled them very well I might add.  I know just
how much effort that takes."<p>Daria looked up, surprised both by the approval
in her voice, and the quantity.<p>"Fifteen?  I hadn't realized it had been so
many."<p>"You never do, when you're in it up to your armpits.  You just deal
with the current crisis, and move on.  But I meant what I said: you've done very
well.  Usually when we break in a new supervisor, I have to work twice as hard
as usual for the first month.  But this week has been my easiest in two
years.<p>Ms. Li leaned forward, folding her hands on the desk, her posture
emphasizing her words as her tone became more serious.<p>"But it's been that
way because you've been driving yourself into the ground.  You need to take some
breaks yourself, and delegate some of the more routine duties.  Take some time
to hang out on the roof with Jane.  I don't want you killing yourself. 
That won't do me any good in the long run, and remember you have a cover to
keep.  People will notice if you look like a zombie at the end of every
day."<p>"Funny, my parents haven't noticed a thing.  Even my boyfriend thinks
I'm just working too hard because graduation's approaching."<p>Ms. Li leaned
back in her chair. "But Jane's noticed."<p>Daria looked up, startled, and
protested, "she doesn't know anything!"<p>"No, I don't think she does, but she
has noticed your behavior.  Remember, there's no such thing as privacy in this
town."<p>"I'm painfully aware of that. I was embarrassed enough kissing Tom
when I thought we were alone.  Now that I know someone's always watching, it's
really difficult.  I'm surprised he hasn't noticed."<p>"Teenage boys are
relatively oblivious to anything outside their own skin."<p>"Yeah, I'd figured
that out myself.  But you didn't call me in here to talk about Jane and Tom. 
What's up?"<p>"Actually, I did call you in to talk about them."  If anything,
Ms. Li's voice turned more serious.<p>Daria looked at her, doubtfully.<p>"Or,
to be more specific, to suggest that you need a break from work.  I've got a job
I need done, and it will give you a change of pace, and it's a hell of a lot
less stress than the ops center."<p>Daria perked up, heartened by the thought
of a break.  "Anything!  What do you need?"<p>
"We've word from a deep cover
agent in DC. He needs to pass us some urgent information.  Phone contact isn't
safe, and I don't want to risk exposing him by using one of our normal agents as
a courier.  I need you to go down and pick up his report from a blind drop. 
Later, after we review the report, you'll leave some information for him to
collect at another drop, plus whatever instructions we add based on his report. 
Just a simple courier mission, and you can even take Jane along and spend the
weekend at a museum, it's the perfect cover."<p>"She'd like that, but isn't it
risky having someone along?  She's not stupid."<p>"I think you're inventive
enough to pull it off.  Worst case, if you have to abort, we'll get someone else
to do the mission next week.  This is urgent, but not that urgent."<p>"So, when
do I leave?"<p>"Now.  We can do it later, but I'd like to have that report as
soon as possible.  Go collect Jane when she gets out of History in fifteen
minutes.  Take the green motor-pool car, materials for the package you'll drop
off Sunday are in the trunk, and they'll fit in your pack.  And this is a field
mission, so take a gun and a phone, and make sure the gun is one of the
non-metallic ones, you don't want to get caught in some metal detector.  Your
code name for any communications with us will be 'Cynic'.  Oh, and here's your
ID card, just in case something goes really wrong."<p>Ms. Li handed a leather
folder over.  Daria flipped it open, and read "FBI, agent Melody Powers".  She
looked up at Ms. Li.  "Isn't impersonating an FBI agent a crime, and aren't I
too young to be an agent anyway?"<p>"It's not a crime if we don't get caught,
and you, or rather Melody, are in their files with an older age listed, so the
credentials will check out if necessary.  It's a favor they do us, although few
people other than their director know of it."<p>"Why 'Melody Powers'?"<p>"I
thought you'd appreciate the humor, Daria," Ms. Li smiled.<p>"And to think,
Angela, for two years I thought you were a humorless bureaucrat."<p>Ms. Li's
smile widened, "I am a humorless bureaucrat, I'd break my cover if I allowed
myself a sense of humor."<p>Daria laughed.  "True enough.  Okay, I'm off to DC.
What do I tell my parents?"<p>"I'll call your mother's assistant, and let her
know you went on a school trip to the city, and won't be back until Sunday
night.  I've made reservations for two rooms at a hotel.  That paperwork's in
the trunk of the car, also.  Make the pick-up tonight while you do some
sightseeing, and spend tomorrow and Saturday playing tourist. The agency will
cover meals and reasonable expenses. We should have the information for the drop
ready by Sunday morning."<p>"Reasonable expenses?  No chartered jets?" Daria
teased.<p>"If you really needed one, we'd cover it.  After this week, I do
trust your judgment."<p>"Now I'm worried."<p>"Good, a little worry is
healthy."<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>Daria and Jane walked into the hotel lobby, a spacious atrium that soared
at least ten stories, with balconies at every floor.  The hotel desk was at the
far side, beyond a large fountain surrounded by a cafe.  A few groups of people
were eating a late dinner, but the room was mostly empty.  <p>"I'm starved,"
Jane said, "all that walking around really burns the calories."<p>"Me too, but
we should check in first and dump our packs," Daria replied.<p>They crossed
quickly to the desk, and the twenty-something man behind the desk looked up with
a weary sigh.<p>"Yeah?" he asked, in a tone that suggested they were about to
waste his time, and their own.<p>"That's what I like about this place, Jane,
the positive, customer-friendly attitude of the staff.  You just don't see that
degree of service most places these days." She turned to the clerk, "Reservation
for two rooms, Morgendorffer."<p>The clerk typed on a computer, then suddenly
straightened and looked at Daria with an odd mixture of respect and
subservience.<p>"Uh, yes ma'am, we have you booked for two rooms on the
concierge level.  I apologize for my earlier tone, I thought you were part of
the school group we have this week."<p>Daria and Jane exchanged puzzled
looks.<p>"What's a concierge level?" Jane asked, addressing nobody in
particular.<p>Daria looked at the clerk, who swallowed nervously before
explaining.<p>"It's a restricted access floor for our frequent visitor club
members and other elite guests."<p>Jane looked at Daria, and raised an eyebrow,
"You come here often?"<p>"First time," said Daria, thinking quickly.  Angela
must have booked the rooms this way for added security.  "But Mom's law firm
does a lot of business in the city."  She turned back to the clerk, "So, do we
get keys, or do I have to kick the door down?  It's been a long day."<p>The
clerk hurriedly handed them two plastic cards, and a map of the hotel.<p>"Rooms
904 and 906, just take the elevator and turn left, you'll need to use your room
key to select the ninth floor, and again on your doors.  I presume you'll be
paying with the card used to make the reservation?"<p>"Sure," replied
Daria.<p>The two turned, and walked over to the elevators.  Just as the doors
began to open, she heard a familiar voice on the far side of the
lobby.<p>"Kevvy, get down off that fountain now!" A girl's voice, as close to
the sound of fingernails on a blackboard as was possible for human vocal cords
to produce, shattered the quiet, stilling conversation throughout the
lobby.<p>"Aww, Babe, I'm not going to fall in," replied a male voice.<p>Daria
and Jane looked at each other, then across the lobby. Kevin Thompson,
quarterback for the Lawndale High Lions, fully attired in his football uniform
and shoulder pads, was standing on the rim of the fountain looking down at
Brittany Taylor, his cheerleader girlfriend, also in uniform.  Brittany, with
her hands on her hips, scowled up at him.<p>"Dear God, where did they come
from?" Daria asked Jane.<p>"That's what I wanted to know Monday, but what are
you two doing here?" Another familiar voice asked, from the now open elevator. 
<p>They turned to see Jodie Landon, student council representative and general
overachiever.  A rare smile lit her face, the ivory of her teeth flashing
against her dark skin.  "Not that I'm not glad to see you, I need all the sane
people I can find after a week around those two."<p>"Um, we're in town to visit
museums this weekend.  What are you doing here?" Daria replied.<p>"It's the
school trip for the Lawndale Model Congress.  We've been here since Sunday
night. We saw the Senate in session today, and we're going to the Smithsonian
tomorrow, and then there's a presidential reception at the Kennedy Center
Saturday night."<p>"Okay, but where do Mr. and Mrs. Clueless fit in?" Jane
asked, as Kevin lost his balance and fell into the fountain, splashing water
over several nearby diners.<p>"Apparently, Ms. Li decided that the football
team and cheerleaders should join us to represent a 'well-rounded student body'
or some such nonsense.  At least I get to see Mack, but I'm not sure it's worth
the price.  Those two," she pointed at Brittany, now helping a dripping Kevin
from the fountain, "have been getting lost, separately or together, and
otherwise causing havoc, all week. I think the hotel is about to ask us to
leave." Jodie paused, considering the two standing in front of her. "Hey, have
you guys eaten yet?  I was just about to, and I don't want to wind up sharing a
table with them."<p>"We're just going to freshen up and then eat," Jane
replied.  "If you get a table and order colas we'll be down in ten
minutes."<p>"Perfect.  I'll be over in the corner, away from the
fountain."<p>Jodie walked off, and Jane and Daria stepped into the waiting
elevator.  Daria inserted her card-key into the slot next to the indicator for
the ninth floor, and the doors closed.<p>"That's weird. Did you know they were
here when you booked the rooms?" Jane asked.<p>"Are you kidding?  I'd have
found another hotel if I had.  I came here to get away from school, not
participate in some kind of field trip."<p>"Well, after encountering Barbie and
Ken, the weekend can only improve," Jane said, smiling.<p>"I certainly hope
you're right," said Daria, with a smirk, "I'm not sure I want to think about
what could be worse."<p></div>
