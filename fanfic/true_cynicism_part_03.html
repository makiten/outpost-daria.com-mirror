<div align="CENTER"><b>CHAPTER 3 - Mission Implausible</b><p></div>
<div>Daria sat on the foot of her hotel bed, talking into the cell phone.  As
she spoke, her eyes kept straying to the connecting door to Jane's room.  The
door was solid, and there was another door behind it, so Jane was unlikely to
overhear her conversation, but she kept her voice low just to be
sure.<p>"...and the last item in the packet is a handwritten note, do you want
me to fax that back to you? It appears to be in code, but it's only one
sentence."<p>"What does it say?" Ms. Li's voice on the phone was tinny,
distorted by the small speaker, but her urgency came across clearly.<p>"The
bear will hunt the eagle by moonlight."<p>"Oh, damn.  That's not code; it's an
allusion.  The Russians are going to kill the President.  Moonlight, hmm. 
When's the next full moon?"<p>"How the hell should I know?  You're the one with
the room full of computers!" Daria said, her voice rising with a note of
panic.<p>"Calm down. We've received the warning in time; we'll handle this."
Daria could hear muffled conversation in the background, then: "Oh GOD DAMN!" 
Daria jerked the phone away from her ear.  Ms. Li's voice continued an unbroken
string of epithets longer than she would have believed possible.  When she
finally ran out of breath, Daria lifted the phone to her ear again.<p>"Bad
news?"<p>"Tomorrow is the full moon.  That has to be it, and there's not enough
time to insert any of our people into the President's security.  I can't even
learn his itinerary on that short a notice. We'll have to warn the Secret
Service, and they'll just cancel whatever he's scheduled to do, and the assassin
will try again later. Damn.  So close."<p>"Angela, I know where the President
is going to be tomorrow night.  The school trip is attending a Presidential
reception at the Kennedy Center.  Jodie can probably get me in
there."<p>"Perfect, then we're all set."<p>"All set!" Daria shrieked into the
phone, then glanced at the door and lowered her voice.  "You want me to prevent
someone I've never seen from killing the President sometime tomorrow night!  We
don't even know how they're planning to do it! Maybe they'll just blow the whole
building up!"<p>"Control yourself, Daria.  Treat this as just another
assignment with an unexpected development.  If you were back here, what would
you tell the field agent?"<p>"I'd tell them they were about to be responsible
for the death of the leader of the free world," Daria replied, bitterly, "it's a
distinction few other agents can claim."<p>"Now, now.  Despair won't get you
anywhere.  Security will be very tight.  They can't bring a bomb large enough to
be useful anywhere near the President. The agent whose report you picked up is
part of a terrorist cell backed by Russian extremists.  Their past
assassinations have all involved close-up use of handguns or poison.  I think
it's safe to say they won't be blowing anyone up."<p>"Sure, it's safe for you
to say that, you're in Lawndale."<p>"And you're the agent on the scene.  You're
going to have to do this."<p>Daria sighed. "I know."<p>"Fine.  I'll see if
there are any other agents I can pull in, but the others I have in the area are
all specialists.  They can follow a plan, but they're not very flexible on their
own.  Even if I can put a team together, you're going to be the team leader. 
Keep the phone on.  If you can't answer it when I call, get away as soon as
possible and call me back.  Good luck, Daria, and good hunting."<p>Daria hung
up the phone, and placed it in the inside pocket of her jacket.  The she
shrugged off the jacket, revealing a shoulder holster.  Removing the holster,
she unloaded the handgun it contained, returned it to the holster, and placed
both in her pack.  Finally she pulled her jacket back on.<p>"Damn, I'm glad to
get that off for the evening. I hate guns.  I'm not cut out to be a field agent.
I wish I were back home writing a Melody Powers story, instead of living one. 
I'm going to screw up, and somebody's going to die.  Not somebody, the freakin'
President.  Oh, God, how did I get myself into this? And why am I asking myself
when I already know the answer?"<p>She jumped, as a knock on the door
interrupted her.  She quickly placed the packet of papers she'd been reading to
Ms. Li into her backpack, and dropped it beside the bed.  Then she rose and
walked over to the connecting door to let Jane in.<p>"Hey, amiga, ready for
dinner?"<p>"Hey Jane, yeah, I'm starved.  I hope Jodie was able to get a table
away from Kevin and Brittany."<p>"Now you're trying to ruin my
appetite."<p>Jane tossed the comment over her shoulder as she headed for the
door.  Daria followed, shaking her head.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>The two exited the elevator, and walked across the lobby looking for Jodie.
There was no sign of Kevin or Brittany, although a janitor was mopping up water
near the fountain from Kevin's plunge earlier.  Finally, they saw Jodie at a
table half-concealed behind a potted palm.<p>"Hey, Jodie, nice hiding place,"
Daria said, walking up to the table.<p>"Yeah, I managed to avoid the dynamic
duo, but it took forever for a waiter to notice me back here.  Our sodas just
arrived.  The waiter will be back in a couple of minutes to take our order.  The
night menu's not very extensive, but it does have a few things that count as
meals."  She handed menus to the two as they sat down.<p>"You mentioned that
you were going to a reception at the Kennedy Center tomorrow night, didn't you?"
Daria asked, as she glanced through the menu.<p>&quot;Yeah, us and about twenty other Model Congresses. They've reserved the entire roof level for the evening. It's quite the gala: catered dinner, dancing, and the President giving a speech on The Future Politicians of America.&quot; You could hear the capitals as Jodie spoke. &quot;You wouldn't believe the headache I had getting tickets at the last minute for the football team and the cheerleaders Ms. Li stuck me with. Hey, do you two want to come? I've got extra tickets now, and it would be nice to have someone to talk to in addition to Mack.&quot;<p>"Not in a million years," said
Jane.<p>"I think I'd like that," said Daria.<p>"Okay, I knew you wouldn't
accept...WHAT?" Jodie practically screamed the last word.<p>Jane, too, seemed
amazed, turning an incredulous look on her friend.<p>"Daria, are you feeling
okay?  You hate things like this."<p>"I know.  It's just that I've never been
to a Presidential reception.  It sounds like it might be
interesting."<p>"Right. Interesting.  A bunch of kids being lectured by
politicians, eating plastic food, and dancing to music that was old before we
were born.  I can think of lots of words I'd use, but that isn't one of them. 
But hell, if you're going, I might as well come too.  Sign me up,
Jodie."<p>"Sure." Jodie looked doubtfully at the two, clearly surprised her
offer had been accepted. "Um, there's just one problem.  It's formal.  Did
either of you bring evening gowns?"<p>Jane, halfway through a sip of her soda,
snorted and began to choke.  Daria pounded her on the back a couple of times
until she began to breathe normally.<p>"You okay? I thought I was going to need
to practice the Heimlich on someone other than Quinn this time."<p>"Yeah.  I'm
fine.  Jodie, neither of us even own an evening gown, nor can we afford to buy
them. Maybe this isn't such a great idea."<p>Daria interrupted. "Actually,
Jane, I've got Mom's gold card.  We can get some tomorrow, and she'll probably
think it was one of Quinn's shopping trips."<p>Jane looked at her friend,
mixing disbelief and bewilderment in one gaze.<p>"Daria, I know you've been
acting weird these last few weeks, but are you seriously suggesting we go
clothes shopping so we can attend a formal reception?  I'd suggest that you've
been replaced with an alien impostor, but even aliens could do a more credible
impersonation of Daria Morgendorffer than you're doing."<p>Daria gazed back at
her, irritated.  She didn't want to go to the stupid reception, what she wanted
was to be far away, but it was her responsibility.  "Look Jane, nobody's forcing
you to go.  I'm going, but you're welcome to do something else."<p>"No way. 
Someone has to keep an eye on you.  Besides, if you're going to wear an evening
gown, I'm going to be there to capture it on film, even if I have to wear one
too."<p>Daria smiled.  Having Jane with her was going to complicate matters,
but she'd deal with the complications; it was good to know she wasn't going to
be alone.  Jodie didn't count, even though she was a friend, because she
couldn't understand how it felt to be one of the unpopular people at a social
function.  That was something Daria and Jane shared.  Jodie was always busy
organizing such functions, never one of the people standing aside waiting in
vain for someone who wouldn't ignore them.<p>"Thanks, Jane, I appreciate it,"
Daria said.<p>"Well, don't go all maudlin on me. This is already too weird for
words, and I'm not sure I could cope with that.  Uh, is your pocket vibrating,
or are you just happy to see me?"<p>Daria frowned, confused, and then realized
that the cell phone in her pocket was ringing silently.  She pulled it out, and
thumbed the "end" button to hang up.<p>"Damn. Mom and her electric leash. I've
got to go call her.  Can you order me a burger with everything and a side of
fries when the waiter shows up?"<p>"Sure," Jodie said.  "Say 'hi' to your Mom
for me."<p>"Yeah."  Daria rose, and walked away, looking for a quiet place to
make her call.<p>Jodie turned to Jane after Daria was out of earshot. "I
thought my parents were control freaks, but they don't make me carry a phone so
they can keep in touch."<p>"Yeah, Helen's really something.  But when did the
Morgendorffers get a second phone?  I can't imagine her lending hers to Daria
for the weekend."<p>"She probably got a two-for-one deal, they're pretty
common. There has to be some explanation, she's got the phone after
all."<p>"Yeah. There just seem to be quite a few things needing an explanation
lately, and no explanations to be found."  Jane said, gazing intently at the
blank wall, as if an explanation should be found there.  "There's something
suspicious about all this."<p>"You worry too much, Jane.  This is Daria, after
all.  I can't imagine her being involved in anything suspicious, can
you?"<p>"No, I can't, and that's what's bothering me.  What could possibly make
her behave like this?  Attending a formal reception, for crying out loud.  This
whole independent study thing that leaves her no time to even hang out during
the day, and that has her completely wrung out every evening.  Those weekend
trips she's been making.  Something odd's going on, but what?"<p>"Well, when
you say it like that, it does sound strange.  But if she doesn't want to tell
us, that's her business."<p>"I know.  I just wish she'd trust me."<p>Jane
sighed, and turned her attention to the menu. Jodie looked at her
sympathetically, but had nothing to add.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>The following afternoon Jodie and Jane stood in the waiting area of the
dressmakers shop, outside the door to the fitting room.  Around them, expensive
gowns were displayed on mannequins, lit by discreet spotlights.  Minimalist
wooden furniture, lightly upholstered, was scattered about the room, seemingly
at random.  The floor and trim on the walls was of a light colored wood, which
provided a discreet contrast to the white walls. A few full-length mirrors were
tucked away in corners, for the use of customers. Scattered plants lent a fresh
tang to the air, which otherwise smelled of cloth and wood.  The overall effect
was simple and elegant, and expensive.<p>"Jane, don't you think we should have
tried to talk Daria into going someplace else?" Jodie asked, not for the first
time, fidgeting slightly.<p>"Relax, Jodie, her mother recommended this place,
and it's her card we're charging."<p>"Well, that's what Daria said, but are you
sure her mother meant this shop?  I've done some clothes shopping in the city,
and I've never been to a place that looked as expensive as this.  There are no
prices on any of the displays.  That's always a bad sign."<p>They were
interrupted by the sound of a door opening, as Daria entered from the fitting
room, wearing an ankle-length green gown.  The gown was slit up to the knee on
one side, allowing her to walk easily, and showed her slender figure to
advantage. Jane and Jodie looked at her, momentarily speechless.  Jane was the
first to regain her voice.<p>"Daria, you're... 
you're..."<p>"Dressed?"<p>"...female!"<p>"Gee, thanks, Jane, I hadn't known
you had doubts." Daria responded, unable to suppress a grin.<p>"No, I mean, you
look like someone in one of Quinn's magazines."<p>"Yeah, Daria, the last time I
saw you in a dress was for your cousin's wedding.  This one looks a lot nicer." 
Jodie added.<p>"That's the benefit of buying custom from a competent
dressmaker, rather than off-the-rack fitted by small-town bridal shop.  Now it's
your turn, Jane."<p>"I don't want to know how much these cost, do I?"<p>"I
don't either, but Mom said it was okay to charge them both to her card, so don't
sweat it."<p>Jane walked back into the fitting room, as Daria turned to examine
herself in one of the mirrors.<p>"I do look pretty good, don't I?" She said
over her shoulder to Jodie.<p>"Careful, Daria, you keep this up and we'll have
trouble telling you from your sister," Jodie smiled as she spoke.<p>Daria
glanced at her, with a smirk on her face.  "Heh, you can't get my goat that
easily.  Unlike my sister, I can appreciate the outside, without believing it
defines the inside."<p>"Is she really that shallow?"<p>"Seriously, no, but she
does a very convincing impression. It's very irritating."<p>A quiet bell
chimed, as the door to the shop opened and two young men entered.  Michael
Jordan MacKenzie, Mack to his friends, Captain of the Lawndale High football
team, and Jodie's boyfriend, entered first.  Another man, a stranger to both
Jodie and Daria, followed him.  The two were a study in contrasts: where Mack
was dark skinned, and had black hair, the stranger had light blond hair and the
fair skin of a Scandinavian.  He was also nearly as short as Daria, with the
wiry build of a long-distance runner.  Mack, who was nearly six-foot tall,
towered over him.<p>"Mack, you're early.  Jane's still being fitted." Jodie
said.<p>"Where's Daria?"<p>Daria turned from the mirror to look at him,
faintly amused. "I'm standing right in front of you."<p>Mack, caught off guard,
gaped at Daria.  "Wow.  What happened to you?"<p>"Clothing. I hear it's very
popular this season among the in crowd."<p>The stranger laughed, attracting
Jodie and Daria's attention.<p>"You haven't introduced us, Mack," Jodie
said.<p>"Oh, right.  This is Alex; he's the quarterback for Midland Falls.  But
unlike our QB, he's actually here because he's also in his school's model
congress.  Alex, this is Jodie, and our friend Daria."<p>"Charmed ladies," Alex
said, with a faint accent, "Mack's mentioned you, Jodie," he turned to Daria,
"but he failed to mention your lovely friend."<p>Daria looked back, amused by
the unfamiliar attention her new clothes were drawing, but not exactly
impressed.  "I don't think you'd be saying that if I weren't wearing this
expensive bait."<p>"It's not the bait that matters, it's the hook in it," Alex
said, with a grin.<p>"I resemble that remark."  Daria turned to Mack. "Are you
sure you didn't tell him about me?"<p>"Nope.  He figured you out all on his
own.  So, how long do we have to wait for Jane?"<p>"If they take as long with
her as they did with Daria, it's going to be another half hour." Jodie
said.<p>"I think Alex and I are going to head back to the hotel, then.  We can
get in a workout at the hotel fitness club.  See you later?"<p>Jodie hugged
Mack. "All right, go have your fun, but you better be cleaned up and in your tux
by six, or you're a dead man.  I am NOT going to spend the evening with Kevin
and Brittany without your support."<p>Mack laughed, "Jodie, you know I wouldn't
abandon you to a fate worse than death."<p>"It'll be your funeral if you do."
She said, in an ominous tone.<p>Mack hugged her again, then he turned to Alex
and gestured towards the door.  Alex nodded to the two young women.<p>"Goodbye
ladies, it was a pleasure meeting both of you.  Especially you and your barbed
wit, Daria."<p>"My wit and I enjoyed meeting you, as well."<p>The two young
men turned and left, leaving Jodie and Daria together, looking after
then.<p>"So, Daria, are you interested in him?"<p>Daria snapped her eyes
towards Jodie. "I have a boyf... whatever.  Remember?"<p>"I remember, but I
wasn't certain if you did.  You sure looked interested."<p>"He is...
interesting, but I'm not that fickle."<p>"Okay.  So, are you going to wear that
dress all day?"<p>"I could.  It's surprisingly comfortable.  But it's a little
on the formal side for tourism, don't you think?"  She said, with a wistful
tone.<p>Jodie laughed.  "Oh, if I only had a video camera."<p>"You're
beginning to sound like Jane, and I don't mean that in a nice way."<p>Daria
turned, and headed back to the fitting room to change, followed by Jodie's
laugh.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>The shop door opened, and the three stepped out onto the sidewalk. Jane and
Daria carried their purchases, boxed, in large shopping bags.  Daria turned to
the others, squinting against the bright mid-afternoon sun.<p>"Can you take
this back to the hotel?" she said, holding up her bag, "I have an errand I need
to run."<p>"Do you want us to come with you?" Jodie asked.<p>"No, it'll be
simpler if I take care of it on my own."<p>Jane looked at Daria for a long
moment, not speaking but with a slight frown, then she quirked an eyebrow. 
Daria's shoulders slumped, as she braced herself for another question she
couldn't answer, but when Jane finally spoke, her words took Daria by
surprise.<p>"Sure.  Do what you need to do, I can carry two bags as easily as
one."<p>Daria looked at Jane.  Her friend's posture suggested weariness, and
not simply from a long day of shopping.  The elation she'd felt from finding
formal clothing that actually made her look good leached away, leaving her
depressed and tired.<p>"Thanks, Jane," she said, sadly, "I appreciate
it."<p>"Don't mention it.  See you back at the hotel."  <p>Jane took the bag,
and walked away.  Jodie looked between the two, and then followed Jane.  Daria
watched them until they rounded the corner at the end of the block before she
turned and set off on her own.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>That evening, Daria and Jane, accompanied by Jodie and Mack, faced each
other across the spacious back of a limousine.  Mack was wearing a tux, while
the other three wore gowns.  Jane in red, and Jodie in peach. Daria smoothed the
green fabric of her gown absently as she looked out the window with a distracted
air.  The rough texture of the heavy silk gave her something to occupy her
senses, distracting her from thinking about the problem ahead, or the gulf that
had grown between her and Jane.<p>Mack broke the silence. "That was pretty
slick, Jodie, convincing Kevin and Brittany to ride in one of the other limos so
they'd get there first for a good seat.  I thought we were going to be stuck
with them for the whole trip."<p>"Yeah, well we're still going to be stuck with
them at our table.  The seating assignments were all done in advance, and I
couldn't change them."<p>The limo turned into the drive, and pulled up in front
of the building.  A uniformed attendant hurried over and opened the car door. 
Jodie and Mack exited first, followed by Jane.  As Daria climbed out, uncertain
in her unfamiliar shoes, her purse swung forward and hit Jane in the
back.<p>"Ouch! Dammit, what do you have in that thing, a brick?"  Jane
protested, as she rubbed her back.<p>"Sorry Jane, just my wallet, cell phone
and a book in case I get bored," Daria said, omitting to mention the two-way
radio she'd picked up earlier in the day from another agent, the earpiece and
microphone for which were now built into her glasses and a string of faux pearls
she wore around her neck.<p>&quot;That's some heavy reading. What is it, War and Peace?&quot;<p>"You're a laugh a minute Jane."<p>They were directed down a spacious
hallway with a thirty-foot ceiling.  From the walls hung the flags of what
appeared to be every country in the world.  At the elevator they had to wait, as
a line of guests was slowly processed through a temporary security checkpoint
supervised by a small group of Marines in dress uniforms.  Daria wasn't worried;
her non-metallic gun was strapped to her leg. She'd move it to the purse later,
once she was inside the security perimeter.<p>Finally, it was her turn.  She
placed her purse on the belt feeding the x-ray machine and stepped through the
metal detector.  On the far side, she handed the invitation Jodie had given her
to one of the soldiers when asked. After verifying her invitation against a
list, he pulled her aside to check her purse; the radio must have looked
suspicious on the scanner.  Examining the contents he came across her ID folder,
and opened it. His eyes widened slightly, as he compared the photo to her
face.<p>"Sorry to bother you Ms...." he began.<p>"Morgendorffer, Daria
Morgendorffer," she said, pointedly. "I understand. You can never have too much
security at an event like this, can you?"<p>He nodded, understanding the
implied "Don't blow my cover." And returned the ID folder to her purse.<p>"Very
true.  I hope your evening holds nothing to mar your enjoyment of the
reception."<p>"I certainly hope so as well, thank you, Major Stewart." She
said, reading the name off his uniform, as she took the purse back from
him.<p>As they waited for an elevator, Jane turned to Daria.<p>"I suppose that
little bit of comedy is something else you can't discuss?" she asked, in a
dejected voice.<p>Daria looked at Jodie and Mack, far enough aside that they
were out of earshot.  She looked over at her friend, and made a decision. 
"Jane, if I tell you what's going on, you can't tell anyone, ever," she said,
softly.<p>Jane perked up.  "You'll tell me?"<p>"I may need some help tonight,
and I certainly don't need to be distracted by trying to avoid you.  Promise? 
Not even Trent can know what happens tonight."<p>"Is it legal?"  Jane asked, in
a concerned tone.<p>"Yes."<p>"Very well, spill.  I promise it will go to my
grave with me."<p>"Bad choice of words," Daria said, "Here, look at this, and
whatever you do, don't laugh."  She handed her ID card folder to Jane.<p>Jane
opened it, looked very closely, and then closed it and handed it back.  "You're
kidding, right?  This is a joke, and you picked that up in a novelty store when
you disappeared today?"<p>"You don't know how much I wish that were true right
now."<p>"You're too young to be an FBI agent."<p>"I'm not one, but they
cooperate with us, and no, I can't tell you who 'us' is."<p>"So, what are we
doing here, Melody?"<p>"Jane, be serious, and don't do anything that would give
me away.  We're here because terrorists are going to try to kill the President
tonight, and I'm supposed to stop them."<p>"Oh."  Jane was silent for a few
seconds.  "Okay, I asked for this.  Who, and how, and what do we have to
do?"<p>"I don't know."<p>"Which don't you know?"<p>"All of the above.  This
is a real mess.  I need to be alert for something, I don't know what, and stop
it when it happens.  There are several other agents scattered around the center
tonight who are also watching, and will tip me off if they see anything.  Just
keep your eyes open for suspicious behavior, and let me know if you see anything
odd."<p>"This is crazy, why don't we just warn the President?"<p>"Because if
we do, the assassin will just try again the next time he comes out in public,
and we won't necessarily have advance warning.  It was a miracle we found out
about this one in advance."<p>"So, we use the Chief Executive as bait for his
own assassin.  That seems a little risky."<p>"Hey, politicians are used to
being sniped at, besides I didn't vote for him."<p>"You didn't vote for either
of them, you turned eighteen after the election."<p>"Picky, picky, picky. 
Yeah, it's a stupid plan, but it's the one I'm stuck with."<p>"It's nice to
know Ms. Li's just as bad at being a spymaster as she is at being a
principal."<p>"I never said anything about Ms. Li."<p>"You didn't need to.  I
listened at the door the day you started your independent study."<p>"Oh." Daria
considered that, briefly.  It helped explain why Jane had been so suspicious.
"Angela isn't really that bad, just understaffed and overworked."<p>"Angela? 
You and her being on a first name basis has to be the weirdest part of all of
this."<p>"Funny, you wearing an evening gown is the weirdest thing I've ever
seen."<p>Jane's retort, if any, was cut off by Jodie calling out.  "Hey, hurry
up you two! The elevator's here, and I'm not going to hold it for
you."<p>"Coming!" Jane yelled, then, turning to Daria, "After you, Mata
Hari."<p>"I knew telling you would be a mistake," Daria said, with a smirk. 
For some reason, she felt more confident of success now than she had before. 
After all, how many people could there be here?  With an extra pair of eyes on
the lookout, the chances of seeing something out of place had improved
significantly.  Her good mood continued as she rode up to the rooftop
level.<p>Then she exited the elevator, and stopped abruptly.  A mob of students
milled about the hallway, spilling out onto the terraces at either end.  There
were hundreds of them, maybe close to a thousand.  This was going to be more
complicated than she'd expected.<p></div>
