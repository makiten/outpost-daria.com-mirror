<div align="CENTER"><b>CHAPTER 7 - The Honourable Schoolgirl</b><p></div>
<div>Daria entered her house, followed by Tom.  Surprisingly, her parents were
both home, and seated on the couch, wearing guilty looks.  Daria wondered what
she'd just interrupted.  She dashed up the stairs before her mother could speak,
yelling over her shoulder to Tom: "Amuse my parents, I'll be down as soon as I
change."<p>Below, she could hear her mother begin to question him, asking about
his tuxedo and what she had meant about changing.  Daria grinned; her mother was
about to have the surprise of her life.  Helen didn't even know Daria owned a
dress.<p>
In her room, she quickly removed her jacket and boots, and flung her
clothes on the bed.  Then she went to the closet and pulled out the long, green,
silk dress she'd worn Saturday night.  Good, it had apparently come through the
night's events without serious wrinkles or stains. She donned it, and grabbed
her purse off the closet shelf, feeling the weight of her gun inside, and
transferred the cell phone and radio from her jacket to the purse, checking to
make sure her false ID was in there as well, in the process discovering that
Glasscutter had included a few other items she might need later.  Finally, she
slipped on the dress shoes and fake pearls (with concealed microphone) that went
with the dress.<p>
She reached into the purse and switched the radio there to
voice-activation; she'd need her hands free tonight.  "Radio test. Cynic to
Fingers, do you copy?" she asked.<p>
"Reading you loud and clear Cynic.  We're
en route to the club."<p>
"Okay, we should be out of here shortly.  Speak up if
there's anything I need to know.  Out."<p>
"Roger, out."<p>Exiting her room,
she walked into the bathroom to check her hair in the mirror.  Reasonably
straight, but she ran a brush through it briefly to make sure.  The she grinned
at her reflection.  Looking good, Morgendorffer, pity Quinn isn't home to see
this.  Oh, well, maybe later. Time to go confuse the parents.<p>
She ran
downstairs, and grabbed Tom, still standing just inside the door, by the arm.
"C'mon, we're going to be late!" she said, cutting Tom's conversation with her
mother off in mid-word.<p>
Looking over at her mother, she saw her expression
change from surprise to confusion, as her mother took in her appearance.  Daria
shoved Tom towards the door, hoping to escape before her mother regained the
power of speech.  No such luck.<p>
"Daria, what... where did you get that
dress?" Helen asked.<p>
Her father had turned to look.  She could see an
approving smile on his face.  He sometimes seemed to be out of touch with his
family, but he always assumed that she knew what she was doing.  It was a degree
of trust her mother seemed incapable of, and one of the reasons she loved him
dearly.<p>
"This is what I bought for the reception last weekend.  Sorry, got to
run, the Sloanes are expecting us," she lied.  The Sloanes had invited her,
true, but had no reason to believe she'd actually put in an appearance this
time, after all of the other times she had not.<p>
Daria followed Tom out the
door, and as it closed she could just catch her mothers plaintive words to her
father.  "Jake, she's wearing a gown.  What's going on?  Do you think they're
eloping? Don't just sit there grinning, do something!"<p>
</div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p>
</div>
<div>Tom pulled his battered car into the country club parking lot.  It looked
particularly shabby contrasted with all the late-model luxury cars present, not
to mention the fleet of immaculate limousines parked in the satellite lot they'd
passed on the way in.  Daria hadn't realized that there was this much of an
upper class in Lawndale, or perhaps they'd been imported from surrounding towns
for the occasion.<p>Turning off the ignition, he faced her with an anxious
look.  "Daria, are you really sure you want to go through with this?  I don't
want you to think I'm pressuring you to fit in with my parents.  I don't fit in
all that well myself."<p>"Relax, Tom," she said, with a faint smile to reassure
him. "I wouldn't do this if I didn't want to.  Give me some credit for
willpower, huh?  So, what's happening this evening?"<p>He relaxed.  After a
brief pause for consideration, he replied: "Well, there was a formal dinner that
we should have missed by now.  There's cocktails and dancing, until around 10 or
10:30 when they'll have the dinning room reconfigured for the presentations, and
the whole thing should wrap by 11:30.  We can sneak out before the presentation
ceremony if you like, lots of people do."<p>"What, exactly, is this ceremony,
and how is your sister involved?"<p>"Well, it's a sort of junior achievers
thing.  There are students from all over the county being recognized for
'contributions to society'.  Elsie was nominated for her volunteer work as a
candy-striper."<p>"I didn't know she worked at a hospital," Daria said. "That's
great."<p>Tom scowled. "It's a big thing in my parent's circle; she gets a
scholarship she doesn't need for helping the hospital cut its budget by not
hiring more nurses."<p>"Still, she did the work.  I hadn't thought your sister
had that kind of depth, or did your parents make her do it?"<p>"No, it was her
idea, I'll give her credit for that.  Anyway, shall we go in?"<p>"I suppose."
Daria opened her door. "Cocktails and dancing.  I can do this."<p>"I hope so,"
said Tom. "Now that I know you can dance, I'm looking forward to getting you out
on the floor.  I'm not up to the tango like your friend Alex, but I can manage a
fairly mean waltz."<p>Ah, this is making more sense, Daria thought as she
climbed out of the car.  Tom's jealous.  How sweet.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>Inside, they entered a large ballroom off the lobby.  At the far end, a few
people were dancing to relatively sedate music, but the majority seemed to be
wandering around or talking in small clusters.  People of her parent's
generation, or older, were in the majority, with a scattering of others of her
age.  There didn't seem to be many in between.<p>Tom spotted his parents off to
one side, and headed for them, pausing a few times to introduce Daria to people
he knew.  She smiled politely, and tried to remember names and faces, but knew
she'd have forgotten most of them later in the evening.  Along the way she
reached into her purse and extracted one of Brittany's presents: a
microphone/tracker bug similar to the one they'd planted on the President. 
Bugging Angier Sloane was her first objective for the evening.<p>
As they walked
up to his parents, Kay caught sight of them and smiled broadly, tugging her
husband away from the elderly gentleman he'd been talking to.  Angier turned,
with a grin for them.  Daria felt suddenly guilty.  Here she was, a trusted
guest, about to betray that trust in the abstract name of National Security. 
Even knowing the serious and immediate threat, it still felt wrong; a means not
justified by the end. She drew a deep breath.  Wrong or not, lives were on the
line, and she wasn't going to get cold feet now.  She carefully schooled her
features into the usual expressionless mask she used in public, and followed Tom
up to his parents.<p>
"Daria!" Kay said. "We're so glad you could make it, and
you look absolutely lovely in that dress."<p>
"Thanks, Mrs. Sloane."<p>"Well,
son, how did you convince Daria to join us?" asked Angier.<p>
"I didn't
'convince' her to do anything.  She suggested it after the movie was over," Tom
replied, with a hint of reproach in his voice.<p>
"Well, whatever the cause,
we're glad you've come, Daria." Angier stepped up on her left, slapping her
briefly on the shoulder. Daria used the opportunity to stumble against him,
slipping the bug into the pocket of his jacket. "Ho, careful there.  People
don't start falling down drunk until later," he boomed.  Daria thought he might
have had a few drinks already, himself.<p>
"Dear, you'll scare Daria off," Kay
said, turning to Daria. "Really, he exaggerates, everyone's very well behaved. 
I'm sure you'll have fun. Elsie's around somewhere, she can introduce you to
people your own age."<p>
"Mother, I know these people too," Tom objected. "I
don't need Elsie's assistance.  Come on, Daria, let's go get something to drink
and we can circulate." Tom grabbed her wrist, and towed her away from his
parents.<p>
Daria followed, until they were out of earshot, then planted her
feel and dragged him to a stop.  "If I needed a tow, I'd have called triple-A. 
What was all that about?" she asked, in a mildly annoyed tone.<p>
Tom looked
abashed.  "Sorry.  I just can't deal with my parents.  They're not giving you
credit for coming, and Dad's drunk.  I can't believe it.  These things are
usually disasters, but I've never seen him drunk before."<p>"Well, he did seem
more jovial than usual, but that's hardly disorderly conduct, and your mother
seemed very polite to me.  Are you sure you aren't overreacting?"<p>"Well,
maybe.  These ceremonies get under my skin.  Everybody's here to be seen being
here, and not because they think the ceremony matters. I'm sorry I dragged you
off like that, but I really had to get away from them. Do you mind?"<p>"No, not
really, but aren't we here to be seen being here too?  Even if your parents
aren't doing this for your sister, you can hardly blame them for doing the same
thing we are."<p>An argumentative expression crossed Tom's face, but it receded
before he spoke.  "No, I can't, and they really are proud of her.  Maybe I'm
just feeling guilty because this time I'm playing the game, and they're being
honest."<p>"Aren't I supposed to be the one who's always second-guessing
herself?  Lighten up; it's just a social function. Let's get those drinks.  I
could use some caffeine and sugar right now, and then we can go meet some of
your friends," she said.<p>"If I can find any.  Most of them have enough sense
to duck this thing too.  Why did I ever drag you here?" he lamented.<p>"You
didn't.  And don't forget that I owe you a dance.  Come on."  She headed for the
bar, and Tom followed.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>A couple of hours later they were finishing their third dance.  They had
proved to themselves in the first one that neither of them knew enough about
dancing to avoid mishaps, and Daria's toes were sore from being stepped on.  She
supposed Tom's were the same.  But they'd carried on, undaunted, and hadn't done
too badly.  As the piece concluded, they headed for the bar.  It was definitely
time for more sugar, and the presentation ceremony should be starting soon.  She
still needed to decide how she could give Tom the slip at 11, but she'd probably
just use the 'powder my nose' excuse.<p>Approaching the bar, she came face to
face with her sister, just turning away from it with a drink in her hand.  Daria
stopped, while Tom continued on to the bar.<p>Quinn looked past her at first,
and it seemed as if she were going to walk away, before she finally saw who was
in front of her, her eyes widening in disbelief.  "Daria?  What are you doing
here?"<p>"Hey, I could ask you the same thing.  This isn't exactly your kind of
social function."<p>Quinn sniffed. "Well, that shows how much you know.  The
fashionable never miss an opportunity to look good in public."  <p>There was
something about Quinn's response that made Daria think she was hiding something.
"So, does that mean the rest of your club is here too?  And your usual
escorts?"<p>"Uh, no.  Jason brought me.  His family are club members.  Do Mom
and Dad know you're here?"<p>Quinn was definitely being evasive, and she hadn't
even commented on Daria's dress.  Something else held her attention.  Time for
the direct approach. "Not in so many words.  We're here to see Tom's sister get
an award, why are you here?"<p>Quinn looked stricken, glancing around as if for
an exit. "Um, look, Daria, can you promise to keep a secret?" she finally
asked.<p>
Daria shrugged, noncommittal.<p>
Quinn sighed. "I didn't tell Mom and
Dad, or my friends, I'd be here; they think I'm at Chez Pierre tonight.  I'm
here because I'm getting an award, and I didn't want them making a big deal out
of it."<p>
Daria looked at Quinn, not sure how to take this. "You?  An award? 
What for?"<p>
Quinn looked down at her feet. "I don't want to talk about
it."<p>
"Really, Quinn," Daria said, exasperated, "I'm going to find out when
they present it, you may as well tell me now."<p>
Quinn gave in to the
inevitable. "Remember when the Fashion Club collected clothes for the
homeless?"<p>
"Yeah, I recall you refused any unfashionable clothing, and ended
up with very little to show for your effort."<p>
"That was Sandi, she thought
collecting unfashionable stuff would hurt our image somehow.  Well, I was
talking to Theresa at Junior Five afterwards, and it turned out that stuff they
couldn't sell was just being sent back to a warehouse at the end of the season. 
I convinced the store manager to donate it to the clothing drive for a tax
write-off, and they even managed to get some stuff from the warehouse that had
been just sitting there.  We've done it every year since, and this year several
other stores joined in.  I didn't really do that much, just helped coordinate
things, but the store manager nominated me for this award thingy.  Please,
promise me you won't tell Mom and Dad?"<p>
"Heh.  The blackmail possibilities
are endless, but no, your secret's safe with me."  Quinn visibly relaxed. 
"Actually, I'm rather proud of you, but I'll deny I ever said that.  So, are you
getting a scholarship too, and how were you planning to explain that
away?"<p>
"Um, well, I was going to tell them if was for something the Fashion
Club did.  They never check if you give them a simple and believable
story."<p>
Daria chuckled inwardly.  Ms. Li had been right; Quinn was a natural
agent.<p>
"Daria, that's a nice dress," Quinn said, clearly over her
preoccupation now, "but those pearls are so obviously fakes.  You should have
borrowed Mom's, they'd look much better."<p>
"Getting out of the house was
difficult enough, without staying to negotiate jewelry."  Not to mention that
without the fake pearls she'd have no place to keep her microphone.<p>
"I've got
to get back to Jason.  See you later, huh?"  Quinn said, almost shyly.<p>
"Yep,
I'll catch you after the presentation, unless I get dragged away by the
Sloanes."<p>
</div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p>
</div>
<div>In the van, Jane turned to Fingers.  "Huh.  There's more to that kid than I
thought. Have you picked up anything interesting from Sloane's bug?"<p>"No, but
he's been getting pretty drunk, and he and his wife just had a hell of an
argument in the cloakroom.  It sounds to me like he's under considerable stress.
If he knew anything, we could crack him easily, but I'm beginning to think he's
just a pawn.  No pro would get drunk at a meeting the day before a major
operation was going down."<p>"Unless he's not really drunk, and it's an act in
case anyone's watching him," Jane suggested.<p>Fingers looked up at her,
skepticism plain on his face. "Jesus, Jane, you've got a twisty mind."<p>Jane
smiled, and leaned back against the instrument panel, with her arms folded
across her chest. "Flatterer. I'll bet you say that to all the
girls."<p>Fingers chuckled, turning back to his communications equipment. 
"Nope, just the cute ones." A smile touched Jane's face.  "God, this is dull. 
He's talking to that damn banker again.  I swear they've had this same
conversation three times already.  If I hear about fluctuations in the prime
rate one more time, I'm going to go in there and kill him myself! Go meet your
damn contact already, moron!"<p>"Temper, temper.  We've got another forty
minutes to kill until the meeting.  I thought your were a veteran of stakeouts,
isn't boredom something you're used to yet?"<p>"Yeah, but it always gets to me
like this.  I need to be doing something.  Usually I play video games while I
wait, but I'm too keyed up.  If we blow this, there's a whole city on the
line."<p>"You need a distraction," Jane said, standing up.  "Allow me to
suggest one."  She walked over, sat on his lap, and kissed him.  "How's that for
distracting?"<p>Fingers smiled at her.  "I don't know, I'm still pissed at that
banker.  Maybe if you tried again?"<p>Jane chuckled, and did as she was
asked.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>Daria sat in the back of the room being used for presentations.  Tom was
next to her, and his parents a few rows ahead and to the right.  There was a
stage at the far end of the room, with the curtain lowered behind a speaker's
podium.  Elsie and Quinn were backstage with the other recipients, waiting to
accept their awards.  But first, several people apparently had to make
long-winded speeches.  She fidgeted, keeping her eye on Angier.  He should be
making his move soon, and she was going to have to get clear first, so it
wouldn't be obvious that she was following him.<p>"Tom, I've got to go to the
ladies', I'll be back in a bit."<p>"That's right, abandon me to a fate worse
than death: after-dinner speeches," he said, with a grin to show he was
kidding.<p>She leaned over and kissed him on the cheek. "I really do have to
go."<p>She stood up, and walked slowly towards the back of the room.  In the
shadows by the door, she turned.  Tom was facing the stage, and Angier was
talking to his wife.  Daria slipped into an unoccupied alcove, apparently a
cloakroom, where she could watch without being observed.<p>"Cynic to Fingers, I
think he's about to move.  What can you hear?"<p>Silence.  What the
hell?<p>"Speak to me, Fingers, what's going on?"<p>Fingers responded this
time, a little breathlessly.  "Sorry chief, my headset came unplugged." She
could hear Jane laughing in the background.  What were those two doing?<p>"So,
what did he just say to his wife?" she asked, impatiently.<p>"Uh, yeah,
something about going to the men's room.  His wife's a real pistol, she told him
if he wasn't back for his daughter's award, he was walking home."<p>"Great,
stay alert.  Cynic out."<p>"Roger, out."<p>She watched as Angier made his way
unsteadily towards her location.  She slipped back into the shadows as he walked
past.  After he'd left, she waited until the door had almost closed before
stepping out and stopping it with her hand.  She scanned the room, but nobody
was looking in her direction.  She glanced out the door, and waited until he'd
turned the corner at the end of the hall, then she moved to follow him, easing
the door shut behind her.<p>"I'm mobile folks, where's he headed?"<p>"He's in
the service corridor, moving in the direction of the stage."<p>Daria jogged to
the corner, and looked into the empty hallway beyond it.  She could see the
entrance to the service corridor up ahead.  She moved up to it
quietly.<p>"Okay, he's turned out of the corridor, into a room the floor plan
calls a bar, but it's a small room, maybe ten by twenty.  He's talking to
someone, I'll patch it through."<p>Daria moved down the service hallway.  As
she did, Angier's voice, and that of someone else, came from her
earpiece.<p>"...did it go?" Angier said.<p>"Badly, very badly.  His security
forces were better than we were led to believe," the other voice
said.<p>"But... I did my part, right? We're done now.  Why did you want to
meet?"<p>"We're not done you fool!  If we can't control him, we'll have to
remove him.  And we need your help to bring him out of his hole.  After tomorrow
night, he'll know how serious we are, but he's going to have to meet with his
financial people sometime, and when he does, you'll let us know when and
where."<p>"Now wait just a minute, we had a deal!"<p>"Yes, and I'm
renegotiating it.  Or do you want your family on welfare?  If I tell the SEC
about your little price-fixing arrangement, you'll be chapter 11 and in jail by
this time next month, and your family will be homeless.  Do you want that?" He
paused. "I didn't think so."<p>They continued talking about details for
communications.  She tuned it out, Fingers was recording the conversation, and
they weren't saying anything she needed to hear just now.<p>"Fingers," Daria
said, softly, "we need to bag this other guy. Are the FBI agents ready to move
in?"<p>"They were supposed to be, but I haven't heard from them.  I'll double
check with the Colonel."<p>"Right, any other exits to this room?"<p>"Yeah,
two.  One to the main hall, and one to the backstage area."<p>"Lovely.  Get
Glasscutter to cover the hall.  Have Artist watch the exit on the far side of
the stage.  I'll sit here until the feds arrive, unless he goes to
leave."<p>"Roger that."<p>Daria waited, listening with half an ear to the
conversation, while she watched the hallway. Eventually, Fingers called
back.<p>"Cynic, everyone's in place.  The feds were in the parking lot all
along, but on the wrong frequency.  They're briefed, and moving in.  One is
going to take the main entrance, and the other will take the service hallway. 
Can you move to the stage door, and block it from the inside?"<p>"Roger.  Is
there an entrance from the service hall to the backstage area?"<p>"Yes, double
doors about twenty feet beyond your location."<p>"I see them.  I'll call you
when I'm in position."<p>Daria moved to the stage doors, and slipped inside. 
She was in a storage area, filled with what looked like scenery flats from a
play, and not a recent one to judge from the quantity of dust on everything. 
Probably left over from last summer. She knew roughly where the door was, but
couldn't see a direct route to it.  She began to move around the flats, working
her way back.  Ahead, she could hear voices from the award recipients milling
about backstage.<p>Back in the bar, judging from the conversation, they were
nearly done.  She hoped the FBI was in position.  She came around a corner, and
saw the door.  Unfortunately, between her and it was a crowd of about fifteen
high-school students.  She drifted towards the door, trying to look like she
belonged in the group.<p>Suddenly, from her earphone, she heard a shout of
"FBI, freeze!" and then several shots rang out.  The shots could be heard
through the wall, and the crowd in front of her began to mill about. She tried
to move faster, but nervous students kept getting in her way.<p>The door ahead
of her burst open, and a youngish man wearing a waiter's uniform ran in, waving
a gun.  He slammed the door behind him, and threw a deadbolt.<p>"Fingers,
target is backstage, and he's locked the feds out. Have them move around to join
Artist.  I'll follow target until we're away from all these people."<p>She
opened her purse, and slipped her hand in, but didn't draw her gun.  There was
no chance of a clean shot in this crowd, and they needed him alive
anyway.<p>The terrorist charged across the room, headed for the fire door on
the far side, scattering screaming students as he ran.  Daria followed in the
path he'd cleared.  As he approached the far door, he grabbed one of the
students in a chokehold, and pulled her against him as a shield.  Positioning
her between him and the door, he moved up to it.<p>"Fingers, have the feds pull
back, he's got a hostage."<p>"Roger, can you take him?"<p>"Negative, we need
him alive, and any disabling shot I took would be likely to hit the hostage. 
I'd rather get him away from the other potential hostages, and try to negotiate.
If we can contain him on the grounds, maybe he'll talk to us."<p>"Got it.  We
have police responding. I can direct them to cordon the perimeter of the golf
course, and a state police helicopter will be overhead shortly.  He's not going
anywhere."<p>The terrorist had been listening at the door.  Apparently
satisfied that there was no one immediately outside, he turned to hit the door
release with his hip, placing his gun against the hostage's head.  As he turned,
the face of the hostage came into view.  Daria froze, as she looked into Quinn's
terrified eyes.<p></div>
