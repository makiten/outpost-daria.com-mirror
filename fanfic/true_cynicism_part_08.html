<div align="CENTER"><b>CHAPTER 8 - Pale Pink for Peril</b><p></div>
<div>The terrorist pushed the stage door open a sliver with his hip, yelling
out: "Get away from the door.  I have a hostage, and if anyone tries to stop me,
I'll kill her!"<p>Daria stood, rooted to the floor, about ten feet behind him,
as he held Quinn to one side. The terrorist had his left arm around Quinn's
neck, and held his gun to her head with his other hand. Daria's hand rested on
the pistol in her purse.<p>While Daria stood there, Quinn silently mouthed the
word "help".  Daria nodded, and mouthed, "wait" back. Daria watched Quinn nod
back, impressed by her composure.  She was obviously terrified, but she wasn't a
screaming wreck.  It couldn't be because she expected Daria to do anything
useful, Quinn didn't know about Daria's recent training.  In any case, all that
training was useless in the present situation.  There were ways to stop a
terrorist with his gun to the head of a hostage, but they were fatal to the
terrorist, and not without risk for the hostage.  Daria needed the terrorist
alive, and didn't intend to take any chances with Quinn's life.<p>Daria thought
about her sister.  If it came down to it, she'd kill the terrorist before she
let him hurt Quinn.  Even if it meant Washington might go up in a fireball
tomorrow night.  There were other options for finding the bomb, and she only had
one sister.  Funny, she hadn't realized Quinn was that important to her
before.<p>Daria took her hand off the gun, and pulled one of the tracking bugs
out of her purse instead.  She mimed grabbing it in her fist, and then threw it
to Quinn, who caught it in her left hand, looking down at it in puzzlement.  The
terrorist, still looking out the opened door, was oblivious.<p>He stepped out
of the doorway, dragging Quinn.  As it closed behind him, Daria spoke softly:
"Fingers, patch me through to the team."  She waited for his acknowledgement
before continuing. "Okay team, he's holding my sister hostage, so we're not
taking any chances.  She's holding one of the bugs.  Fingers, you keep track of
her. Glasscutter, return to the van in case we need to get mobile.  I'll join
Artist in the hall once he leaves the building and we'll follow on foot.
Fingers, what was the shooting earlier?"<p>"He went to leave and took a couple
of shots at the FBI agents.  Nobody was hurt.  They took Sloane into custody,
but haven't charged him yet."<p>"Okay, we can hold him for seventy-two hours
without formal charges.  Have someone from HQ take him off their hands.  We'll
need to wring anything he knows out of him before tomorrow night, just in case
they let something slip in his presence."<p>"Isn't this your boyfriend's father
we're talking about?" Fingers asked.<p>"Yeah.  Life sucks.  He's also guilty of
at least securities fraud, and possibly treason and accessory to half-a-million
counts of attempted murder.  Ask me if I care about his delicate
sensibilities."<p>"Point taken.  Okay, the target is outside and Artist reports
the hallway is clear."<p>Leaving the still panicking students behind, Daria
stepped through the door, finding only Jane in the hallway, and closed it behind
her.  Jane was wearing black fatigues and a set of night-vision goggles that
covered most of her face.  Not exactly low-key, but probably no more conspicuous
than her usual jacket and shorts would be compared to the tuxedos and evening
gowns the guests were wearing.  The outfit did have the benefit of rendering her
anonymous.  She held out a duffel containing another set to Daria.<p>"He went
out the back," Jane said, gesturing at a fire exit. "She'll be okay, Daria.
She's only useful as a hostage alive."<p>"Yeah, until he doesn't need one
anymore, or feels too cornered to be rational," Daria replied, as she quickly
stripped off her dress and donned the fatigues and boots.<p>"Well, we won't let
it come to that."<p>Daria nodded, not trusting herself to speak.  She stuffed
her gown and shoes into the duffel and placed it behind a potted shrub, where
they should remain hidden until she could retrieve them later.  The two walked
down to the fire exit and out onto a porch overlooking the golf course behind
the club.  Stairs in the center of the porch led down to the green.  The lights
along the porch had been shattered; Daria could still see the rocks lying below
them in the broken glass.  She nodded approval at Jane.<p>Below, the terrorist
was making for the side of the building nearest the parking lot.  He stopped, as
sirens sounded in the distance, and turned back, ducking under the porch. 
Shortly afterward, a golf cart shot out onto the green and headed down a paved
path.  Quinn appeared to have been tied to one of the cart's seats with the
terrorist's belt.<p>As soon as they were out of sight, Daria and Jane rushed
down the stairs and grabbed a second cart.<p>"Jane, you drive.  I may need my
hands free," Daria said.<p>Fingers' voice crackled in her ear. "Cynic, you
aren't forgetting we need him intact?"<p>"We need him breathing.  Intact is
optional. Relax, I'm still planning to negotiate.  Have Glasscutter swing the
van around to the far side of the course in case we need backup."<p>"Roger,
we're on our way," he replied.<p>Jane threw the cart into motion, and they
lurched off after him.<p>"Whee!" Jane cried.  "Follow that cart!"<p>Daria
smiled.  Trust Jane to find some humor in the situation. "If you catch him
before the eighteenth hole, I'll double the fare," she replied.<p>"That's no
fair, I'm not getting paid for this."  When Daria didn't respond, Jane looked
over at her.  "No fare, get it?"<p>"Yeah, just drive.  My sense of humor isn't
up to par for some reason."<p>Jane looked at the golf course surrounding them,
and groaned.<p>The cart, its electric motor humming, rocketed down the path at
a fast walk.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>They came out of the woods, and could see the other cart several hundred
feet ahead of them, heading down the slope towards a bridge over a small stream.
Jane swerved onto another path, which veered off to the left.<p>"Hey, what are
you doing? They went down there!" Daria yelled, pointing to the
right.<p>"Relax, this is a short cut.  Once he crosses the brook, he'll need to
wind up the other hill between those sand traps.  We'll duck over the ridge, and
circle around the woods at the top of the hill.  It's faster."<p>Daria looked
at Jane, perplexed.  "Fingers has a map of the golf course?"<p>Jane shrugged,
embarrassed. "Nah.  I played golf with Tom and his family once.  We took the
shortcut racing them back to the clubhouse."<p>"You. Played. Golf?"<p>"Yeah,
yeah.  I'm going to burn in hell, all right?  Don't make it any worse."<p>"Ah,
the things we do for love.  Of course, I never went that far," Daria said with a
smirk.<p>"So, what are we going to do when we get ahead of them?" Jane asked,
ignoring the comment.<p>"Ambush.  You block the path with the cart and distract
him.  I'll hide and come out behind him with my gun.  As long as he isn't
holding a gun to Quinn's head, I can disable him if I have to, and if he's
smart, he'll realize he has no option but to talk to us."<p>"Yeah, but he could
still take a shot at me before he realizes it," Jane protested.  Her tone
carried a mixed message: she was joking, but with a core of seriousness.<p>"I
know." Daria turned to Jane, all humor banished from her voice. "If you want, I
can be the distraction."<p>"But you at least know how to shoot one of these
things.  I just had Ms. Li's safety briefing this morning.  I couldn't hit the
ground reliably."<p>"With only two months of practice, I'm not really much
better.  But I'd rather it was my finger on the trigger if something goes wrong.
Anyway, at night, at a distance, he's not really likely to hit you, if you keep
down behind the cart, and duck if it looks like he's going to shoot."<p>"Yeah,
like I believe that.  But I'd rather it was your finger on the trigger, too. 
The only thing worse than shooting him, would be shooting Quinn by
mistake."<p>"Yeah.  I know."<p>Fingers' voice broke the silence. "Cynic, I may
be able to help here.  If you wait until he's past the woods on the top of the
ridge, I should have line-of-sight from the road.  That's only about six hundred
yards, and it's a moonlit windless night.  I have a snipers rifle with night
sights, and can take him from there if it's necessary. It's probably less risky
than you two waving pistols around and making targets of yourselves."<p>"Isn't
that fairly long range? asked Daria.<p>"Not really, I've done longer
shots."<p>"You're a man of unexpected talents," Daria said, and thought she
heard Jane mutter, "You aren't kidding."<p>"Yeah, well, it was my military
specialization.  There's not much call for it in our line of work, but I've kept
in practice."<p>"Okay, set up where you think is good, and let us know where to
set the ambush.  If you need to shoot, try to disarm him if you can, but the
hostage's life comes first.  You got that?"<p>"The Colonel won't like it if we
kill him."<p>"That'll be between the Colonel and me.  I'm asking if you're
willing to do this my way?"<p>"You're the boss, Cynic, the Colonel said so
herself.  Long as I'm on your team, I follow your orders.  The hostage comes
first."<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>They'd parked their cart at the edge of the woods, blocking the path, with
a radio set up on one of the seats.  Jane and Daria crouched on opposite sides
of the path, behind what cover the small trees offered. Daria was just far
enough off the drivers side of the path that he shouldn't be able to see her,
and with her night-vision goggles, she could see the area around the cart as
clearly as if it were day, albeit with a monochrome green color to everything. 
Fingers kept up a running commentary about the range of the tracker Quinn was
still holding.<p>As Fingers said, "Here he comes," the cart crested the ridge
and started down, braking to a halt about twenty feet in front of Daria.<p>From
the empty cart, the radio yelled: "Hold it right there.  We've got the whole
course surrounded.  Why don't you make this easy and give up?"  The voice was
Brittany's, but it was electronically distorted to prevent Quinn from
recognizing it.<p>Daria stood slowly and moved towards the path.  She walked
quietly, holding her gun in front of her with both hands, ready to shoot if the
terrorist wouldn't surrender and Fingers missed.  The terrorist waved his gun in
front of him, trying to decide where the voice was coming from.<p>Brittany's
voice rang out again.  "Now drop your weapon, and place your hands atop your
head."<p>This time, the terrorist located the voice, and fired. The broken
radio crashed down some distance behind the cart.  At the same time, the
terrorist was thrown backwards as his shoulder fountained blood.<p>Daria ran
up, grabbed him by the collar, and threw him out of the cart on his face before
he could recover, but it didn't matter, he'd dropped his gun when Fingers shot
him.  She glanced quickly over her shoulder at Quinn, who seemed unharmed,
although blood had sprayed her face, and she was being quietly sick onto the
roadway.  Daria sympathized; the smell of blood was turning her own stomach
too.<p>Jane ran up, and shoved her gun in the terrorists face, whispering,
"move and I'll finish the job."  Daria saw that Jane had forgotten to cock the
gun, so it wasn't likely to go off, either by accident or on purpose. 
Fortunately the terrorist was in no condition to notice such details.<p>Daria
patted him down, finding another gun in an ankle holster.  Then she took out her
commando knife, and cut his waiter's jacket off.  Quickly, she sliced it into
strips, and formed a crude pressure bandage for his shoulder.  It would keep him
alive until they could get him to medical attention.  Finally, she bound his
wrists and ankles with plastic electrical ties Jane had brought, fast and as
effective as handcuffs for her purpose.<p>She looked up at Jane, whispering:
"Take the hostage down to the van in your cart.  I'll stay here until the
helicopter arrives."<p>Jane nodded, and holstered her gun.  Then she walked
over to Quinn, and untied her from the cart, handing her a cloth out of some
belt pouch, and leading her over to the other cart as Quinn wiped her face and
mouth off.<p>As she climbed into the other cart, Quinn looked back at the
terrorist on the ground, with a smile of satisfaction.  Then she looked up at
Daria, crouched beside him.  "Thanks for rescuing me, Mr...?"<p>Daria,
anonymous behind her goggles, merely smiled back, and nodded her head.  Quinn's
smile faltered, and she turned away.  Jane threw the cart into motion, and Quinn
grabbed for the dash, as the cart lurched over the edge of the path and back
onto the trail.<p>When the cart was out of range, she spoke into her
microphone.  "Fingers, the hostage is on the way.  Make sure you don't have any
speakers live once she's in the van.  You can turn her over to the police to
return her home and then meet me at HQ.  I'm going to ride with the
prisoner."<p>"Roger that, Cynic.  I'll have Artist return with the cart once I
have the hostage.  That'll keep her clear."<p>"Good idea.  Catch you later,
Cynic out."<p>"Roger, out."<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>Back at the country club, Tom was frantic.  Nobody had heard the original
gunshots over the after-dinner speaker, but when the award recipients poured out
from backstage in a panic, yelling about a gunman, the room had erupted in
chaos.  He'd fought his way up to his mother, in time for his sister to come
running up in tears.  Then state police had swarmed into the room, and tried to
reassure everyone that the situation was under control.  The room was still in
chaos when a middle-aged man in a cheap sport coat walked up to his mother, and
flashed an FBI badge.<p>"Mrs. Sloane?  I'm agent McGee.  Could you and your
family come with me? We need to talk to you."<p>His mother took this calmly, as
if such things happened every day.  Tom was impressed, despite himself. "Of
course, agent McGee," she said, "but my husband isn't with us at the
moment."<p>"I know ma'am, he's safe.  If you'll follow me...," he said, turning
away.<p>Tom couldn't contain himself. "Excuse me, agent McGee, but my
girlfriend was out in the hall, have you seen her?"<p>McGee looked over his
shoulder. "I don't think so. What's her name, and what does she look
like?"<p>"Daria Morgendorffer.  Short, wearing a green dress, with auburn hair,
and glasses."<p>"Nope, haven't seen anyone like that, but we'll check around. 
She'll be okay, though.  Nobody's been hurt."<p>"She was backstage," Tom's
sister, Elsie, blurted out.  "When the gunman came through, she was with
us."<p>The FBI agent pulled a radio from his belt, and spoke into it, giving
Daria's name and description to someone.<p>When they finally fought through the
crowd into the lobby, which was filled with state police in riot gear, agent
McGee turned to Kay.  "Ma'am, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but your
husband's been arrested on suspicion of securities fraud.  He was also
consorting with the gunman who disrupted your party, but we're still not clear
on the details there.  We've impounded your car as evidence, but I can arrange
to have one of these troopers give you a ride home."<p>"Thank you, agent McGee,
but we'll wait for Daria and Tom can give us all a lift home." She turned to
Tom. "If that's okay with you?"<p>"Yeah, but it could be a while.  Maybe you
and Elsie should go home now, rather than waiting."<p>"No," said Elsie, "I'd
rather know she was okay."<p>Agent McGee's radio cracked, and he held it up to
his ear to listen.  Then he turned back to the group.  "Well, your friend is
fine.  Her sister was taken hostage, but she was recovered a little while ago. 
The police took the two of them home."<p>Tom was annoyed that Daria hadn't
found some way to tell him, but then he realized she probably hadn't had a
chance to think about anything else if she'd been there when Quinn was taken
hostage.  He'd call her when he got home, and make sure they were both all
right.<p>"I'm glad she's okay," he said to the FBI agent, then he turned to
what was left of his family.  "Let's go home."<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>Daria and her team sat with Ms. Li in one of the conference rooms off of
the operations center under Lawndale High.  They'd been reviewing the night's
events while they waited for word from the interrogation team that was working
on the terrorist.  The phone rang, and Ms. Li picked it up.  Turning to Daria,
she said, "It's for you, we intercepted a call from the Sloane's to your
house."<p>Daria took the phone. "Morgendorffer residence."<p>"Daria, it's me,"
Tom said, "are you okay?  We heard about Quinn, is she all right?"<p>"Yeah,
we're both fine.  Quinn's a bit of a nervous wreck after what she went through,
and I had to ride back with her to help calm her down.  I'm sorry I couldn't
find a way to get word to you."<p>"That's okay, as long as you're both safe,"
he said.  <p>Daria closed her eyes.  Yet another lie between them.  Maybe she
wasn't cut out to be an agent after all.  "Thanks," she said, in a quiet and
defeated voice, "look, I've got to go deal with stuff, okay?  I'll call you
tomorrow, after school."<p>"Yeah. I may not be in school tomorrow.  My father's
been arrested, and we're going to see about bailing him out.  If you can't reach
me at home, call my Mom's cellphone, you've got the number."<p>"Oh, Tom, I'm
sorry about your father.  Yes, I'll call your mother's phone if I can't reach
you directly.  Got to go, bye." She hung up the phone, and cradled her face in
her hands. "God, I hate myself.  I've ruined his family, lied to him, and I
can't even tell him so he can hate me."<p>The rest of her team looked away, as
if they'd rather be anywhere else at the moment.  Ms. Li pursed her lips in a
frown.  "You didn't ruin his family.  His father did that all on his own.  As it
is, we'll probably do a deal with Angier in exchange for evidence against the
other conspirators.  His family should come through this with their finances
intact, and if it makes it any better, they have you to thank for it.  The SEC
was about to land on Angier anyway.  If you hadn't done this, he'd still be in
jail, but without any reason for us to pull him out, and they'd be
penniless."<p>Daria looked up at her, with tears streaking her eyes.  "It
doesn't really make it any better."<p>"I know," Angela said, with a note of
sympathy, "deceit doesn't add that way.  But it's still not your
fault."<p>"Wait a second," Fingers said, "you're going to let him get away with
attempted mass murder?"<p>"No," Angela replied, "that's one crime he wasn't
guilty of.  He was blackmailed into helping set up the Presidential kidnapping,
but he didn't know any details of what they were doing beyond that. 
Technically, we're letting him get away with securities fraud and accessory to
kidnapping, but that's all, and he doesn't get off scott-free.  He's going to be
in 'protective custody' until all the trials are over, and that's far longer
than someone with his money would spend in jail for being an unwilling accessory
to an unsuccessful kidnapping."<p>The door opened, and one of the staff walked
in, carrying a red folder, which he handed to Ms. Li wordlessly, then he turned
and left.  She flipped through the folder, with everyone's eyes riveted on her. 
Then she closed it, and looked up.<p>"Well, our 'terrorist' cracked.  He wasn't
a terrorist after all, just a junior law clerk, in way over his head.  He
spilled everything.  Between him and Angier, we can bring the whole conspiracy
down with a little more work.  Unfortunately, we still don't know where the damn
bomb is, but we have confirmed that they have it, and plan to use it tomorrow
night.  And, we know who knows where it is.  You should all get a good night's
sleep, we'll probably be ready to move in the early morning."<p>Angela stood
up, and walked out of the room.  Daria looked around at the others.  They looked
back, grins on their faces.  "We did it!" Jane yelled, and the others joined
in.<p>Outside, in the ops center, Ms. Li smiled as she heard the cheers through
the door.  The team was settling in together nicely.  It should, considering the
years she'd invested in grooming the various members. It was a shame she'd be
throwing them into the line of fire tomorrow, rather than using them for the
kind of work they were best suited for, but it was necessary that she pull this
off, and she couldn't risk outsiders who might not follow orders.  Anticipation
of a successful operation buoyed her spirits as she walked away.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>Daria sat on her bed a couple of hours later, preparing for bed.  She'd run
the gauntlet of parental concern, but at least Quinn's night as a hostage seemed
to have driven all thoughts of her supposed elopement out of her mother's head. 
Quinn had been subdued, which wasn't normal for her, but otherwise seemed to
have come through her ordeal intact.  Daria had to admit that her sister
surprised her.<p>She sat there, thinking about the evening's operation.  They'd
taken Angier cleanly, and even brought in his contact in shape for interrogation
despite the man's amateurish and suicidal stupidity of trying to shoot his way
out of an ambush without being able to see a target.  Now they had a line on the
real backer, and could roll him up tomorrow. The conspiracy was falling apart
like a Chinese puzzle with the key piece removed.  She felt nervous: It was too
easy, too neatly wrapped up.  Something was going to go wrong tomorrow, she was
sure of it, even though she couldn't say why.  She stared at the far wall,
without really seeing it, as she thought over the events of the last several
days, trying to decide why she was so uneasy.<p>Her fruitless introspection was
interrupted by a knock on the door, followed by Quinn asking if she could come
in.  Daria assented, and Quinn walked in and sat next to her on the
bed.<p>"Daria," she said, "I wanted to thank you, for tonight."<p>"Huh?  I
didn't do anything Quinn, but I'm glad you're okay.  You are okay, aren't
you?"<p>"Yeah.  Here, this is yours." She handed the tracker bug back to Daria,
then grabbed her in a fierce hug.  "I'm glad you're my sister."<p>Daria
wasn't sure how to react, but decided that hugging her back was the best idea. 
"Look, Quinn, I really didn't do anything.  One of the FBI guys asked me to get
that to you, I don't even know what it does."<p>"Okay, Daria, whatever you
say."  Quinn released her hug, and Daria saw that there were tears in her eyes,
above a big smile.  "Then, the thanks are just for you being you."<p>She hopped
off the bed, and walked to the door. As she stepped through it, she turned back
and, still smiling, said, "By the way, I would have thought even you would know
that you can't make black fatigues stylish by wearing fake pearls with them,"
and she closed the door.<p>Daria sat on the edge of the bed, staring at the
door without moving, for several minutes.<p></div>
