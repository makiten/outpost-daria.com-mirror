<div align="CENTER"><b>CHAPTER 9 - Daria's People</b><p></div>
<div>As Daria walked down the stairs, she could hear her mother and Quinn
talking at the breakfast table.  Apprehensive, she strained to make out their
words, but they were only talking about school.  Quinn had recognized her last
night.  That still sent a chill down her back.  One little slip, wearing the
fake pearls containing her radio microphone--the ones that Quinn had seen
earlier--with her supposedly anonymous fatigues.  It was the sort of mistake
that got agents killed.  Not that this one would, but if Quinn broke her cover
they could both wind up making an extended stay in a Federal penitentiary. Well,
at least they'd have each other for company, and it would be less nerve-wracking
than her life had been lately.<p>If Quinn were only older, this would be
simpler.  Angela wanted to recruit her anyway.  But she was only sixteen, and
agency policy prohibited recruiting minors.  It was only policy, not law, and
could be ignored if necessary.  That was Angela's call to make.  Meanwhile,
Daria worried if Quinn understood the need for secrecy.  She'd seemed to
understand last night, but they hadn't really talked.  They couldn't really
talk; anything Daria said would only divulge more information, make the
situation worse.<p>She rounded the corner into the kitchen, trying to look like
it was just another morning before school.  Her mother broke off and looked up. 
"Good morning sweetie, would you like some waffles?" She gestured at the plate
in the center of the table, piled high.  It looked like Dad had been cooking
again; he always made enough to feed a small army, probably some kind of
flashback to military school.  Daria suddenly wondered if her new life gave her
more in common with her father.  She'd have to find some way to ask him if his
school had had any classes in Military Intelligence.<p>She realized her mother
was still looking at her, waiting for an answer.  What was the question?  Oh,
breakfast. "Sure, looks good.  Dad cooking for the Army again?"<p>
"Yeah," said
her sister. "And after he ate one, he realized he was late for a meeting, and
ran off.  It's a good thing I'm starved."  She forked another two onto her
plate, which was already smeared with syrup from a previous occupant.  Daria
wondered, not for the first time, how Quinn kept so slim.  Of course, she
usually didn't eat so much.  Daria slid a lone waffle onto her own plate, and
poured syrup over it.<p>
"Sweetie, are you sure you want another two?" her
mother asked Quinn.  "How can you eat after your ordeal last night?" Helen
looked suddenly hesitant.  Wondering, no doubt, if reminding her daughter of
being taken hostage by a terrorist had been the best thing to do in the middle
of a meal.<p>
Quinn, however, seemed unaffected.  "Ordeal?  Mo-om, nothing
happened.  This guy tied me to a golf cart and drove around the course, then
some soldiers rescued me, and a cute guy in a wheelchair gave me a lift
home."<p>
"But Quinn, the terrorist threatened you with a gun, and then he was
killed right in front of you." Helen, apparently abandoned by her own appetite,
looked down at her own plate and pushed it away.  "How can you eat?"<p>
"God,
Mom, don't be so dramatic.  He didn't DO anything; he just waved a gun around. 
And he was a bad guy. Why should I care if the good guys killed him?  Serves him
right.  It was gross, but that was yesterday.  It doesn't bother me
now."<p>
Daria thought Quinn's protest sounded slightly forced.  Her mother
apparently thought the same.  "Sweetie, will you at least talk to the school
psychologist about it today?"<p>
"Ugh, Mom, no way.  Mrs. Manson's a real freak.
I'll be fine."<p>Helen gave up.  "Okay, but I'm going to drive you to school,
and your father's going to pick you up at the end of the day.  I want to know
you're safe."<p>"Hey, whatever makes you happy." Quinn's uncharacteristic
acceptance of the prospect of being seen in public with her parents convinced
Daria that she was still upset by what had happened.<p>Helen looked at the
remains of the waffle on her plate, and apparently had had enough.  She stood. 
"I'm going to warm up the car.  Finish your waffles and hurry out, we need to
leave soon if I'm going to make my first meeting."  Quinn grunted a vague
assent, her mouth full of waffle, as their mother left the room.<p>After the
door closed, Daria set her fork down.  "Quinn, you're still bothered by last
night, aren't you?"  Quinn looked up with denial in her eyes.  "Look, you might
fool Mom, although I don't think you did, but you can't fool me, so don't even
try."<p>Quinn chewed her waffle, and swallowed, spearing another chunk with her
fork.  But as she raised it to her mouth, she apparently changed her mind, and
began to talk, waving the laden fork around for emphasis.  "Of course I'm still
freaked out.  One of your friends killed someone right next to me.  I spent
hours washing the blood out of my hair.  Maybe you're used to death, but I'm
not."<p>"He's not dead," Daria said. "It was only a superficial wound."<p>"Oh.
The paper this morning said he was killed."  Quinn seemed relieved.<p>"Don't
believe everything you read.  But don't tell anyone he's alive.  Officially, he
was killed in a shootout."  Daria was nervous.  She shouldn't be telling Quinn
this.  But she'd be damned if she'd let her sister think she went around killing
anyone who got in her way, even if she had wanted to kill the bastard for
threatening Quinn.<p>"Daria," Quinn began, hesitantly, "what was last night all
about? What are you involved in?"<p>"I can't tell you.  But we are the 'good
guys.'" She hesitated.  "Um, it's really important that you don't tell anyone
about me, or about anything except what was in the paper.  Someday I'll probably
be able to explain, but not anytime soon."<p>"Yeah, I understand." Quinn looked
at Daria, a shy, vulnerable expression on her face.  "I really am glad it was
you last night."  She stopped, embarrassed.  Daria felt the same, and couldn't
think how to respond.<p>She settled for changing the subject, pulling the
tracking bug Quinn had returned last night out of her jacket pocket and handing
it to her.  "Here, keep this.  It'll let us follow you if something were to
happen again.  Although it shouldn't be necessary; he didn't have any
accomplices around here, and he only grabbed you because you were in the wrong
place at the wrong time."<p>Quinn looked at the bug, then stood up and slid it
into the pocket of her jeans.  "Thanks.  I better go, before Mom freaks.  Um,
she thinks I was at the club for dinner, don't tell her about the award, okay?
See you tonight?"<p>"Your secret's still safe with me. I don't know about
tonight.  There's a chance I'll be spending the night at Jane's."<p>"Oh. Well,
be careful," Quinn said, entirely too perceptive for Daria's comfort. Quinn
grabbed her pack off the floor, and ran for the driveway.  "Bye,
Daria!"<p>Daria waited until she heard the car pull out, then reached into her
pocket and pulled out the cell phone, dialing a number rapidly.  "Hello, ops? 
It's Cynic.  I want a twenty-four by seven audio monitor on tracker thirty-two
seventeen."  She paused, while someone objected.  "I know you're busy.  It's
important."  She waited some more.  "Because I said to, dammit!  Have you
forgotten you work for me?"  Another pause.  "Yes, that Cynic, how many do you
know?  Right, out."  She hung up the phone.  God, now she knew why Angela called
them puppies.<p>She turned her attention back to the waffle.  Just time to
finish it, then she could walk to Jane's and they could pretend it was an
ordinary school morning, even if it wasn't.  That was the essence of a good
cover: to live it, no matter what was happening.  She felt vaguely guilty for
having Quinn's conversations monitored, but if Quinn was going to slip up, they
needed to know.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>As Daria walked up to Jane's house, Jane dashed out.  Daria thought about
rebuking her for her uncharacteristic energy, but Jane hadn't had any training
in maintaining a cover yet, so she settled for a mild comment instead. "Whoa
there, it's just another school day, slow up."<p>Jane halted, and looked around
self-consciously.  Daria groaned inwardly.  They really needed to send her to
the training camp, and soon.  Jane realized what she was doing, and stopped,
with an embarrassed look.  Then she walked up to Daria. "Damn, I'm never going
to get the hang of this.  So, how's the princess this morning?  Still freaked
out?"<p>Daria turned and headed for school, Jane keeping pace beside her.  "Not
as much as I expected.  There's one problem though."  Jane raised an eyebrow in
inquiry.  "Quinn recognized the pearls I was wearing at the ambush."  Jane
stopped dead.  Daria, perforce, stopped too.<p>"Did she tell anyone?" Jane
asked.<p>"No.  So far she's kept it to herself.  Angela's going to kill me for
making such a stupid mistake."  Daria resumed walking.  Jane followed.<p>"Why?
You couldn't know Quinn would recognize a string of pearls in the dark.  You'd
think she'd have had other things on her mind, like the terrorist who'd been
threatening to kill her."<p>"Yes, but I should have known.  It is Quinn after
all.  If anyone's going to notice the way a hostage rescue team accessorizes it
would be her."<p>"True," Jane assented.  "Hey, Daria?" she asked,
hesitantly.<p>"Yeah?"<p>"What do you think of Fingers?"<p>Daria looked over
at Jane, whose eyes were focused on the sidewalk in front of her, apparently
unwilling to look at Daria.  She wondered where this was coming from.  Jane had
seemed interested in him last night, but it wasn't like her to ask Daria about a
guy.<p>"Fingers?  He's a good comm. tech."<p>"No, not that, I mean as a
person," Jane said, still intent on the pavement.<p>"I don't really know him
any better than you do, why?"<p>"Well, it's just... Last night, we were getting
along really well before Quinn was kidnapped.  And then, that whole shooting
thing.  It's got me all confused.  I realized I don't know him at all.  To be
able to shoot someone down in cold blood like that, and he said it was his
specialty. It just bothers me.  Is he some kind of assassin?" Jane finally met
Daria's eyes as she finished.  Daria was reminded of a kitten she'd once rescued
from some boys who'd been tormenting it.  It had had the same look of fearful
uncertainty. She'd never seen Jane afraid before.<p>Daria considered her words
carefully, thinking back to her orientation course.  "No.  We don't do
assassinations.  He's a sniper."<p>"What's the difference?"<p>"An assassin
kills people because someone tells him to. A military sniper, like he was, kills
enemy soldiers in wartime, the same as any other soldier. A civilian sniper only
kills in defense of someone else, like in a hostage rescue.  Neither is the same
as assassination. Another part of a sniper's job is infiltration, observation
and reporting. That part's very similar to what we usually do.  It's not so
surprising as you'd think for him to have come from that specialty.  We get a
lot of field agents that way."  <p>"Oh," said Jane.<p>Daria decided that
sugarcoating it wasn't fair to Jane.  "I'm not saying it's nothing.  Killing
from a distance, calmly and in cold blood, isn't the same as killing in the heat
of a battle, and military snipers are a form of legitimate terrorism; their job
is to cause chaos on the battlefield by removing officers, and to demoralize
soldiers by making them aware that being surrounded by thousands of their
fellows is no protection.  But that doesn't make him evil.  I think you need to
judge him on his own merits, not on the job he was trained to do ten years ago. 
If he was some kind of psychotic, Angela wouldn't have him on her
team."<p>"But, why didn't he mention it when he told me about his military
experience?  That's almost like lying about it."<p>"Well, he shouldn't even
have told you about the military.  We're supposed to keep our real identities
secret, even from fellow team members.  You, Brittany, and I are a special case,
because we know each other in real life.  Unfortunately, because of the way I
recruited you, he knows who you are too.  I guess it's all right for him to tell
you about himself, given that, but it's really risky if other agents know you. 
They might be captured and interrogated, and your cover could be blown without
you even knowing it."<p>"All these secrets.  I can accept the need for secrecy
in the abstract, but it's harder when it comes between me and someone I like. 
But, I guess you know that even better than I do," Jane said.<p>"Yeah, between
Tom and Quinn, I'm becoming an expert on lying to the people who matter to me. 
But that's part of the job, and I need to accept that if I want to keep on doing
it, and I think I do.  If you and Fingers are going to be more than simply
fellow team members, you're going to have to accept that both of you will have
to keep secrets from the other sometimes."<p>Jane didn't respond, and they
walked on in a companionable silence for a couple of blocks.  Finally, Jane
spoke: "Yeah, you're right.  When you come down to it, I was quick enough to
stick a gun in the terrorist's face last night, myself.  And I would have shot
him if it had been necessary to save your sister.  That's not really any
different from shooting someone from across a field."<p>"No, you wouldn't",
Daria said, with a grin, glad of the change of subject, "you forgot to cock your
gun."<p>"I did?"<p>"Yep."<p>"I'm never going to get the hang of this, am
I?"<p>"You say that like it's a bad thing," Daria replied. "I'm not sure I'm
ever going to get the hang of the more active parts of this job, and I'm not
sure I want to.  I'm much better at the planning end.  Working back in the ops
center was more my style.  You'll be fine when you're in an
information-gathering role.  We just need to get through this emergency
first."<p>"Yeah. All we need to do is save the Capitol, prevent World War III,
and keep our fellow students from noticing we missed class.  Piece of
cake."<p>Daria chuckled, and the two walked on, thinking about the day
ahead.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>Angela stood at the head of the table in the briefing room. She faced the
team, except for Fingers who had returned to DC last night to prepare for
today's mission.  She passed out stapled pages containing Xeroxed copies of
building floor plans, background information, and aerial photographs of the
grounds of a small mansion.<p>"This is the target," she said, indicating the
photograph of a late middle-aged man on the last page. "Rupert Lyle.  He's a
well-known Washington lobbyist, and a partner in a high-profile law firm.  The
same firm that employed the man you captured last night.  According to our
informant, he's due to return home today at four PM, to make the final contact
with the people who have the bomb, which is due to go off at seven PM.  You're
going to watch his house.  When he makes the call it will be scrambled, and we
won't have time to crack his code, so you're going to listen in on his end with
a shotgun mike, and signal us when he makes contact, so we can trace it. 
Between eavesdropping and the trace, we should be able to locate the terrorists.
Once we're sure we know where they are, you'll collect him, while one of our
other teams takes care of the weapon."<p>"Why don't I just bug his house in
advance?" asked Brittany.  "That's more reliable than an external
mike."<p>"True," Angela said.  "But we're pretty sure his home security system
is state of the art.  If you set it off going in, he'll switch to some backup
plan we don't know.  We can't take that risk."<p>"What if he doesn't return
home to make the call?" asked Daria.<p>"I have another team covering his
office, and his car has been bugged, but I don't think either of them will be
used.  He doesn't want any risk that he'd be detected, and virtually every phone
in Washington is tapped by somebody. He knows his home phone is secure.  He does
government work, and the FBI sweeps it periodically.  They just checked it last
week, or I'd send you in disguised as FBI for a new sweep. Any other
questions?"<p>The others were silent, flipping quickly through the papers in
front of them.  Finally, Daria made eye contact with each of them, receiving
small nods.  She turned to Angela. "Nope, we're ready to roll.  I'll call you
when we get to DC."<p>"Right.  Good luck people, we're counting on you."  She
picked up the papers in front of her, and left the room at a brisk walk. 
<p>Daria turned to Jane and Brittany. "Go get your stuff, and sign out a motor
pool car.  I need to check on the bug I set on Quinn, just in case, and then
we'll be off.  It's a long drive to the city, and we need to be in position well
before four, in case he's early."<p>The others nodded, and gathered their
papers.  Daria hurried out, intent on her unpleasant duty.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>Outside the school, Daria joined the other two, with a serious look on her
face.  It had been nearly thirty minutes since the meeting broke up, and Jane
asked if there was a problem with Quinn, but Daria shook her head.  Jane decided
to leave her to her thoughts, and watched the town go by outside the window as
Brittany drove.  It was so peaceful.  Jane had never thought she'd be nostalgic
for Lawndale, but now she couldn't wait for the mission to be over, so she could
return here.<p>As Brittany pulled out onto the highway, Daria tapped her on the
shoulder, and pointed to the next exit.  "Turn here.  We're taking a shortcut." 
Brittany nodded, and swung the car back off the highway.  Jane raised an eyebrow
in inquiry, but Daria shook her head.  Once they were off the highway, she
continued to give Brittany directions without speaking, until they arrived at
Lawndale airport.  It was a small facility, mostly used by private pilots, and a
couple of commuter flights to nearby cities.  A separate terminal building
served several airfreight services that kept planes here, rather than in the
more expensive city airports.<p>They left the car in a small parking lot next
to the airfreight terminal, and walked into the building.  On the far side of
the room, Daria recognized a familiar figure, despite his lack of uniform. She
walked over to Major Stewart and shook his hand. "Good to see you again.  Glad
you could make it."<p>"I'm happy to be of assistance.  If you'll come this way,
we're ready to go."  He turned and led them out though a back door onto the
paved apron of the airport.  A U.S. Marine helicopter was waiting, with rotors
idling.<p>They ran to the door on the side, and climbed aboard, closing it
behind them.  As soon as everyone was strapped down, the Major tapped the pilot
on the shoulder and gestured.  The engines reved, and they were airborne.  The
Major passed out headsets with microphones, so they could talk to each other
over the engine noise.<p>"So, Agent Powers, we'll have you at Bolling in thirty
minutes tops.  Some of my men have already contacted your associate, and he'll
be there to meet you.  My team will wait at the airbase in case you need any
more assistance."<p>"Thanks.  We should be able to handle this on our own, but
it's good to know you're backing us up."<p>They passed the rest of the journey
in silence.  Daria shrugged off the inquiring looks from Jane and Brittany, and
they accepted the need for secrecy, keeping their questions to
themselves.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>At Bolling Air Force Base, just south of the White House, they joined the
waiting Fingers in his van, and headed up the Anacostia Freeway towards the
city.  It was just past rush hour, and the roads were still quite busy, but not
jammed.  Daria picked up a clipboard and wrote a quick note to Fingers.  He read
it, and looked up at her in surprise, then began to fiddle with his
communications equipment.  Daria waved Jane to silence as she was about to
speak, and they waited for Fingers.<p>Eventually Fingers finished his work, and
turned to Daria with a puzzled frown.  "Three bugs," he said, "how did you
know?"<p>"Are they all dead now?  Any transmissions going out at all?"<p>"All
dead, and everything's shut down.  If anything were transmitting, I'd have it. 
The only risk is a record-and-burst transmitter; I think I'd have found one, but
I can't guarantee it since it wouldn't be transmitting."<p>"Okay."  Daria
pushed the door to the front of the van open, so Brittany could listen.  "Here's
the deal, folks.  Don't ask how I know--there are some need-to-know issues
involved and I can't tell you--but we've been set up.  The fellow we captured
the other night was a plant.  The goal was to ensure that we waited to search
the house until four.  My bet is that the bomb's inside, and it's going to go
off sometime before four PM, not at seven as we thought.  We need to move in,
and recover the bomb before then.  If we need firepower, the Major's men are
standing by, but I expect light opposition, if any.  They aren't going to sit
around on top of an atomic bomb if they can avoid it."<p>"So, who bugged us,
and why the radio silence?" asked Fingers.<p>"The terrorists. There's a leak in
the agency," said Daria.  "We've gone silent to avoid tipping them off.  They're
not expecting us to be in position for several hours yet, so lack of contact
shouldn't raise any suspicions."<p>"Does the Colonel know?" asked
Brittany.<p>"No.  I couldn't find a way to tell her without risking being
overheard.  We'll deal with the agency problem after we've disposed of the bomb.
I have some ideas on how we can smoke our leak out.  But for now, lets focus on
disarming the bomb.  That's our priority."<p>They lay the floor plans out on
the communications console, and began making plans for entering the mansion
without alerting any guards that might still be there.<p></div>
