and Jane return to <st1:City><st1:place>Lawndale</st1:place></st1:City> for

most popular pizza restaurant?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>Pizza.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For most, it's just food. For <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
<span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span> and <st1:Street><st1:address>Jane Lane</st1:address></st1:Street>,
former students of <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Lawndale</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>High
  School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, it is a way of life. Every other day,
they would sit in their favourite booth at the Pizza King and wax
misanthropical about life and the people in it over a couple of slices of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Italy</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s
greatest export.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Eventually they would depart <st1:City><st1:place>Lawndale</st1:place></st1:City>
for the bright lights of college life in <st1:City><st1:place>Boston</st1:place></st1:City>.
<span class=SpellE>Daria</span> went for Raft, while Jane, after a bit of
persuading, went to <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Boston</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Fine</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceName>Arts</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>College</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.
Their lives were now full of new people, new adventures, <span class=GramE>new</span>
pizzas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, as fate would dictate, they would have one last,
hot, steaming, cheesy piece of business to take care of in <st1:City><st1:place>Lawndale</st1:place></st1:City>.
<span class=GramE>One that they were not expecting in any way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Yo, you up for pizza?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Do I even need to answer that?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No. But you could give me the courtesy of giving an
answer."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sure."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One quick farewell to Jake later, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
and Jane filed out of the guest bedroom and out the doors of the <span
class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span> house. Their favourite restaurant in their youth,
the Pizza King, was only a short drive to downtown <st1:City><st1:place>Lawndale</st1:place></st1:City>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As they arrived there, it soon <span class=GramE>occurred</span>
that <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Jane weren't the only ones thinking
pizza. They could recognise a couple of their high school alumni, the
red-haired <span class=SpellE>Wiccan</span> <span class=SpellE>Scarlett</span> <span
class=SpellE>LeFaye</span> and skateboarding enthusiast Josh Carter, <span
class=GramE>waiting</span> outside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>Because the shop was empty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> tried the door handle, but
to no avail. <span class=GramE>Locked.</span> She looked up to find that the
door sign read "CLOSED".</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> scratched her head. "I
should have read that first."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That's strange," said an equally perplexed Jane, "Pizza
King is never closed on a Friday afternoon. Or any time really."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Maybe they finally found out what was in the mystery meat."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Didn't you hear?" said <span class=SpellE>Scarlett</span>,
"The Pizza King has been closed for nearly a week now."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, no. We only just came back from <st1:City><st1:place>Boston</st1:place></st1:City>
a couple of days ago. You know, to see our family that we wanted to escape from
so bad."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"OK, then."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The four of them shuffled awkwardly, before <span
class=SpellE>Scarlett</span> broke the silence. "So what do you do with
yourselves nowadays?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Not much," said Jane, "<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
still writes, I still paint, but we do some local midnight-to-dawn radio in <st1:City><st1:place>Boston</st1:place></st1:City>
to help pay the bills. At least until our personal projects get off the ground.
<span class=GramE>How about you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well Josh and I are dating."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Congratulations, I think. I meant what do you do for a
living?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Josh skates professionally as part of the Ultra Cola Energy
travelling tour, while I travel the world looking for hidden treasures."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So you're basically Indiana Jones? That's badass!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It sure is, man," said Josh, looking into his girlfriend's
eyes, "But I hope that she'll settle down before she gets run over by a giant
rolling boulder."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The four of them laughed. Soon, <span class=SpellE>Scarlett</span>
and Josh said their goodbyes and walked off, leaving only <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
and Jane standing in front of the empty shop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So," said Jane, breaking the silence, "Do you want to go
elsewhere for our pizza fix?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Depends," replied <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, "Where
do you think we should go?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"<st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Well</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Pizza</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>Forest</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> is empty, at least until the
kindergarten crowd shows up."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"NO. Their pizza is crap and those singing squirrels are
rabid and out of tune."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"How about <span class=SpellE>Pepe's</span>
then?</span> It's a bit out of the way, but they score an 8.0 on the Lane
scale."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Never mind.</span> I'm not hungry
anyway."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With that, they walked away. They were both disappointed,
but not worried. In their minds, they thought it would just be open again
tomorrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>Except it wasn't.</span> They had planned
on at least one big pizza lunch while they back in <st1:City><st1:place>Lawndale</st1:place></st1:City>,
but now it looked like they weren't going to get it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What gives?" shouted Jane as she looked into the empty shop
on Saturday afternoon, "They're never closed this long! Even over Christmas he
is open on the 26th."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Really?" asked <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, intrigued.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Oh yeah.</span> <span class=GramE>Me</span>
and Trent have had three Lane Christmases at the Pizza King. Their eggnog and
turkey sausage deluxe is delicious."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Wait... eggnog ON the pizza?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Of course.</span> Is there any other way
to have it?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> could feel her insides
turning over. "Doesn't sound like something I'd eat."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, so our greasy peasant food isn't good enough for you?"
said Jane, without a hint of seriousness in her tone, "Your tastes have changed
since you started eating <st1:City><st1:place>Boston</st1:place></st1:City>
pizza."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That's right. Nothing but caviar and baby seal eyes on my
pizza slice, please."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Seriously, though, I'm getting worried now. It's so unlike
Gino for him to not have the Pizza King closed this long."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With that in mind, they walked back to the <span
class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span> house, hopped into <span class=SpellE>Daria's</span>
car and drove the ten miles out of <st1:City><st1:place>Lawndale</st1:place></st1:City>
to <span class=SpellE>Pepe's</span>. Later, they would agree that the standard
of their pizza had definitely slipped in the last few years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then it was Sunday. The day dragged on like usual, but at
least there were some classic Sick, Sad World reruns on they could watch.
Sometime during the third episode of the day (Are Canine gangs running the
streets? The <span class=SpellE>muttley</span> crew, next on Sick, Sad World!),
Jake walked in from the kitchen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Hey kiddo!</span> Hey... <span
class=SpellE>er</span>... Jane-o!" he said cheerily, "Didn't hear you come
down."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> turned the TV down. "Ninja
training is finally paying off."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Oh God!</span> Am I paying for that too? <span
class=SpellE>Dammit</span>! There are too many bills..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As he was waving his arms around like a lunatic, Jake
finally saw in his hand the reason he had come in the living room in the first
place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hey <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>," he said, giving her a
larger-than-normal envelope, "This came for you in the mail on Friday."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Why am I only getting it now?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I only just went and got it from the mailbox. I've been
very busy lately, you know."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jake sighed. He had been getting the most consulting work he
had gotten in years, but it was very stressful, especially for a man with one
heart attack already.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Jane looked at the logo on
the envelope. It was that of the Pizza King. Somewhat confused, <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> opened the letter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>To <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>If you are reading this letter, then let it be known that
I have passed on. It was most likely due to the lung cancer, but in case it was
because of something, or someone, else, <span class=GramE>make</span> sure that
you catch that bastard and give him an old country <span class=SpellE>whuppin</span>'
for me.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Anyway, I digress. I remember seeing you and your friend
Jane come into my shop pretty much every other day for at least three years. So
much so that the financial records show that the two of you have accounted for
25% of my annual monthly income at the time.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>You both clearly care about your pizza, which is why I
have left my shop to the two of you.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>You're probably wondering why. I was never married, and I
never fathered any children, so I have no family to leave it to. The Pizza King
was all I had.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Enclosed within are the deed and keys to the shop. Don't
worry about the rent for a while, because I was always paid up a month in
advance, but after that it's up to you to make sure it's paid on time.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>This pizzeria meant a lot to me, and I can tell that it
means a lot to you and Jane.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Please take care of it.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Sincerely,<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Gino <span class=SpellE>Marella</span><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Owner and Head Chef, Pizza King<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>P.S. I've sent this letter to Jane as well, but I'm only
entrusting the important things to you. Looking at her house from the car, I
get the feeling that the mail doesn't get opened there very often.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"He doesn't know how right he is, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>!"
said Jane, trying to stifle a laugh, "<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> gently put the letter down
and looked inside the envelope. Just as Gino has written, a second piece of
paper and a set of keys were inside. Jane picked up the keys while <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> looked over the deed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jake couldn't believe it. "Is this for real? He really died
and gave you the Pizza King?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> took another look at the
deed, before looking over to her father. "It's real. Looks like me and Jane are
the proud new parents of a bouncing baby pizzeria."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Later that night, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Jane
sat down with Jake and Helen around the kitchen table to discuss their new
business acquisition. <span class=GramE>Helen had already gone through the deed
and accompanying letter with the metaphorical fine-tooth comb and seemed
satisfied that all was above board.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"All right," she said, "Everything looks to be legitimate,
but I need to get in contact with the Pizza King attorneys just to make sure.
Maybe Eric has their number."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen then left the room, <span class=SpellE>cellphone</span>
to her ear, waiting for someone at work to pick up. Meanwhile, the home phone
rang and <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> picked up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was Quinn, calling from <st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span
  class=SpellE>Pepperhill</span></st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
in <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>. "Hi! Did you get
back to <st1:City><st1:place>Lawndale</st1:place></st1:City> all right?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah, but it didn't become a crater like I hoped it would.
Can't have everything in this world though, can we?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Not with that attitude. So, have you and Jane done anything
interesting since you came back?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"We inherited the number one pizza restaurant in town. That
may count as interesting."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Really?</span> I find this hard to
believe."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Same here.</span> Gino kicked the bucket and
left it to us because, apparently, we were his top customers of all time."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn laughed. <span class=GramE>"That I can believe.</span>
Well if you really do own the place, I hope you redecorate the entire shop.
Those booths were tacky and they didn't go with any of my shoes."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Then why did you keep eating there?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Because they were the only place nice
enough to make <span class=SpellE>cheeseless</span> pizza.</span> All the other
places just laughed at me when I asked. You'll still make <span class=SpellE>cheeseless</span>
pizza, right?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It may be a crime against humanity, but I've never turned
down money in my life and I'm not about to start now."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After some further talk about Quinn's success in college, <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> passed the phone to Jake and Helen came back into the
room. "Apparently one of Richard Riordan's underlings is taking care of this
situation, and he says it's all legitimate."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She then hugged <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> suddenly.
"I'm so proud of you. <span class=GramE>Co-owning your first business straight
out of college!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's nothing," said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> as she
shifted awkwardly, "I think Jodie Landon already owns a resort in <st1:City><st1:place>Las
  Vegas</st1:place></st1:City>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I heard about that place on the news," said <span
class=GramE>Jane,</span> "Isn't that where the white tigers force the humans to
do tricks for a paying audience?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You sure that was the news you were watching?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Anyway," Helen continued, "All you have to worry about is
what you do. Speaking of which, what about your radio jobs back in <st1:City><st1:place>Boston</st1:place></st1:City>?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Mom, you know as well as I do that it was only temporary to
help pay for college. Maybe in some other alternate universe we'd be the best
damn radio personalities in all the land, but in this one, we're not."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Besides," said Jane, "This might help pay the rest of it
off. Not to mention rent payments for a warehouse apartment."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"And what about <span class=GramE>your</span> other
friends?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"They're all on their own vacations right now, but we'll
definitely be staying in contact."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So, there's nothing stopping you two from doing this?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I guess not."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just then, Jake walked back in the room and sat down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"How's Quinn doing at <span class=SpellE>Pepperhill</span>?"
asked Helen, having not had a chance to talk to her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Quinn's doing great," replied Jake, with a proud smile on
his face, "Especially in commerce, surprisingly enough. So, girls, have you
decided whether you want to run the Pizza King yet?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yep," said Jane, "We're going for it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Then can I help at the shop one day? It's not going to be
easy with just the two of you there, and I feel like I've finally turned a
corner in regards to my cooking."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Memories of Jake's 'cooking' came flooding through <span
class=SpellE>Daria's</span> mind, sending a cold chill down her spine. She
looked over to Helen with a raised eyebrow, who simply shrugged her shoulders,
before answering her father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You seem very busy with your consulting, but we'll see how
things turn out."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jake's smile disappeared. "Oh. OK. I guess I should probably
get all of that done first."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Right then, a loud ding interrupted the conversation. Helen
stood up, put on a pair of oven mitts and grabbed a tray out of the oven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> stared down at the
all-too-familiar foodstuff placed on the table in front of her. <span
class=GramE>"<span class=SpellE>Lasagna</span>, <span class=SpellE>hm</span>?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Some things never change."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Later that night, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Jane
lay in their beds in what was Quinn's room, but for the time being was the
guest room. Jake and Helen had found it easier to move <span class=SpellE>Daria's</span>
bed in there from her old room than trying to do the opposite with Quinn's.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I think you should re-paint this room while we're here,"
said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, staring at the bright yellow walls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Honestly, I'd change the carpets first," replied Jane,
"Pink shag doesn't do it for me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> sat up on her bed and
sighed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane sat up as well. "What's wrong, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You know, Jane, it still hasn't sunk in yet. I did have a
vague idea of what I wanted to do after college..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That cabin in <st1:State><st1:place>Montana</st1:place></st1:State>
will always be there if you want it. It's not like there's heavy competition
for it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"There is that, but I was referring to other stuff. I don't
know if I'll be able to do any of that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, there will be plenty of
time to write. We don't have to be open every day, you know."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> turned to Jane, her face a
picture of slight worry. "Do you think we're ready to run our own pizza
restaurant?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"We owe it to Gino that we at least try. Pizza sells itself.
All we have to do is make the magic happen."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I know. Good night, Jane."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Night, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For all the nerves they had within, it didn't take long for <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Jane to get to sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was Tuesday afternoon when <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
and Jane decided to open up the Pizza King and take a look inside. As <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> turned on the lights, they noticed that it looked
almost exactly the same as it did three years earlier. Same blue booths, albeit
a little more faded. <span class=GramE>Same red-tiled floors.</span> The soda
fountains, pizza ovens and dishwasher still looked in great condition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> shivered. "I think it's a
little bit eerie being in here alone with no customers."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"How is it any different from the times we were the only
ones here?" asked Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"For a start, there was a nice big slice of pizza in front
of me. Hey, let's make some!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No dice, <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>. The shop
may have only been closed for a week, but I'd think the toppings in storage
have either gone off or were cleaned out."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Damn."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was then that Jane turned to the blank wall next to the
soda fountain, and her eyes lit up. "I think I've just found my personal
project for the next couple of days."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Let me guess. You're going to paint that wall aren't you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Hell yeah!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Any reason why, other than satisfying your creative urges
and or getting out of cleaning?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Nope.</span> <span class=GramE>Got it in
one."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One quick trip back to the <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffers</span>
later, Jane had her art supplies and was ready to go. Meanwhile, <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> had the task of getting the kitchen clean. Gino
obviously did his best, but one man could only do so much. The fact that the
place hadn't been touched, let alone cleaned, in a week and a half meant that a
fine sheen of dust covered every counter top.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>On top of one of those counter tops, sat a
worn-out looking book.</span> <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> walked over to
find that the front of the book read "<span class=SpellE>Marella</span> Family
Recipe Book" in embossed golden font.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> felt over the cover before
opening it up. <span class=GramE>"Hey, Jane!</span> Come here!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane walked into the kitchen, wiping her hands on a
paint-covered rag. "How many times have I told you? Never disturb me doing my
sketching phase."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I found the family pizza recipe book. <span class=GramE>Must
have been passed down through generations of <span class=SpellE>Marellas</span>
by the looks of it."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> then felt a twinge of
sadness come over her as she realised something. "That means, if the letter was
right..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It stopped at Gino. Heavy."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two of them stood silently over the book for a moment in
contemplation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane broke the silence. "I guess it's up to us to keep this
going as well. <span class=GramE>At least for one more generation."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's a lot easier to pass a recipe book down to your
children than it is to run a pizzeria. Now let's take a proper look at this
thing."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the next half an hour or so, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
and Jane read through the book, getting all the basic recipes memorised in
their brains.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well what do you know," <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
said to Jane with a grin as she turned to the sauces page, "The secret
ingredient in the Marinara sauce actually was a quart of grease."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"No way.</span> They couldn't have had
grease back in the old country."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"And we won't need it here. <span class=GramE>Grease-free
sauce for all."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> then raised an eyebrow and
made a money motion with her fingers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane <span class=GramE>slumped</span> her shoulders. "Damn.
I guess I owe you that $20 from 1998 now."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You know it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane, grumbling and muttering under her breath, reached into
her pocket and handed <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> a crumpled up <st1:City><st1:place>Jackson</st1:place></st1:City>
and walked out of the kitchen back to her painting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As she put the bill into the inside of her jacket pocket, <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> took a look at the still dirty kitchen. "This
normally calls for an upbeat '80s cleaning up stuff montage. It's too bad that
I don't do upbeat."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the next week, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> cleaned
up the kitchen and storerooms and organised new stock deliveries, while Jane
alternated cleaning up the seating and service areas with continuing her
painting, something that she wouldn't let <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> see.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Soon it was Wednesday, nearly 2 weeks after they had
officially inherited the Pizza King. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> was busy
preparing the new grease-less Marinara sauce when Jane came bursting in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's finished!" yelled Jane as she grabbed <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> by the arm and dragged her out of the kitchen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Finally," said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> as she saw
the white sheet covering the wall, "Let's see it." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane carefully pulled down the sheet and unveiled her mural
to <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The mural depicted Gino as she remembered him 3 years
earlier, slightly balding brown hair and thick moustache, with a satisfied
smile on his face, sitting in a grand throne and wearing a flowing purple robe
and a golden, jewel-studded crown. Behind it, two flags were intertwined. The <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>il</span></span> <span class=SpellE>tricolore</span>
of the Italian flag, and the stars and stripes of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> flag. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> stood in stunned silence
momentarily before a hug from her friend snapped her out of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"After all these years," she said to Jane, "I still can't
believe how great your art can be."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I know," said Jane, beaming as she let go of <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>, "It was almost as if a real Pizza King could
manifest itself, he would look like this."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane then put an arm around <span class=SpellE>Daria's</span>
shoulder. "I think we're ready to go, mi <span class=SpellE>amica</span>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> took another look around
their restaurant. The tables were sparkling clean, the chairs and booths had
been re-upholstered with newer blue cushioning, and the soda fountains were
filled and ready to serve. Back in the kitchen, all the counter tops were clean
and all the ingredients were in cold storage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes we are. I just have one last phone call to make when we
get home."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After locking up and driving home, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
made that phone call.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Lawndale Sun-Herald, Tori Jericho speaking."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hello, we like to place a full-page ad in your newspaper
for tomorrow and Friday."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Sorry, not my department.</span> I can
make a mention in my column though. What is it?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"The Pizza King restaurant in downtown <st1:City><st1:place>Lawndale</st1:place></st1:City>
is re-opening this Friday, under new management."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Cool. I used to eat there a bit back in my high school
days. <span class=GramE>Your names?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"</span><st1:Street><st1:address><span
  class=GramE>Jane Lane</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span class=GramE> and
<span class=SpellE>Daria</span> <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"<span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>?</span>
That name rings a bell... any relation to Quinn <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Her sister."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh... I remember you now. You were my Language Arts teacher
for like a week when O'Neill was on strike. You weren't very popular back then,
were you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It wasn't exactly something we were worried about."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tori laughed. "Still got the same sarcastic wit, I hear."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Soon, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> said her goodbyes and
turned back to Jane. "What do you know about Tori Jericho's column?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I have a better question. Who's Tori <st1:City><st1:place>Jericho</st1:place></st1:City>?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Some old friend of Quinn's and..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"<st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Lawndale</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>County</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>'s
premier gossip columnist," said Helen, walking in from the kitchen, "But I
doubt it will do that much." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hmm... maybe we should wait another week and get a proper
ad in."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So, you were finally opening up?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, why would I do that?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen stared at <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, eyebrow
raised.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You're referring to the Pizza King, aren't you? Yes, we
were going to open this Friday, <span class=GramE>But</span> it looks like we
might have to wait to get some more word on the street."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I think you're finally realising that this isn't going to
be easy. Running your own business is very hard work. Just ask your father."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Suddenly, there was a loud yell from upstairs, then a
crash."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Honey!" yelled Jake from upstairs, "We need another mouse
for the computer!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Never mind.</span> Anyway, I've got to
go. Dinner is in the oven."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With that, Helen walked out the door to pull a late shift at
the law firm. Soon, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, Jane and Jake were sitting
at the kitchen table trying to eat another <span class=SpellE>lasagna</span>
meal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Why is it that we always end up eating this?" asked <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> as she poked her portion around on the plate with her
fork.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's easy and it's cheap, kiddo," Jake replied, "When your
mom works as much as she does, she doesn't have a lot of time to cook."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"While you on the other hand have too much
time to cook."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm getting better, I swear! The last time I cooked, Helen
didn't throw up at all."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"<span class=GramE>Me</span> and <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
have a favour to ask you," interrupted Jane, "We need to get the word out that
Pizza King is opening up again, and we think you might know some decent graphic
artists that can design an ad to put in the paper."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Why can't you do it yourself, Jane? Your art is great from
what <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> has told me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Thanks, but I'm a fine artist, not a graphic artist. <span
class=GramE>Big difference."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, OK. Well I'll make a few calls and see what I can do."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the next couple of days, Jake made those calls, while <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Jane designed the basic outline of their ad. On
Monday, they sent it away for the final graphic improvements. By Wednesday, it
was on page 7 of the Lawndale Sun-Herald.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Everything was falling into place nicely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After going to the restaurant on Thursday for last-minute
tests of both ingredients and appliances, it was finally opening day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"<st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City> said he's
sorry he couldn't make it out of jail in time for today," said Jane as put her <span
class=SpellE>cellphone</span> in her pocket, "But he sends his best wishes."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What's he in for this time?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Same as usual.</span> <span class=GramE>Going
too far at anti-government protests.</span> He's really gotten into all that
stuff after <span class=SpellE>Mystik</span> Spiral broke up."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> then walked over to the oven
to turn it on. Only for Jane to turn it back off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"<span class=GramE>Wait,</span> what..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I now declare this pizza restaurant open." said Jane in a
mock British accent as she theatrically turned the oven back on, "<span
class=GramE>Sorry,</span> couldn't resist."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From the kitchen, she and <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
could see a healthy crowd of about 30-40 people waiting to get in for food. At
the front of the crowd, stood Helen and Jake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> turned to Jane as a bead of
sweat ran down her face. "We're really doing this."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Yep."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"There's no turning back now."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Nope."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You ready?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"As ready as I'll ever be. <span class=GramE>You?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> took a deep breath and wiped
the sweat away. "I've never been more ready in all my life."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With that, they walked to the front door, turned the sign
from "CLOSED" to "OPEN" and unlocked the door to a huge cheer from the crowd.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pizza King was open for business once more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First up the counter <span class=GramE>was</span> Helen and
Jake. "Hello, Jane. How are things so far?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"We've only just opened, Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Please, call me Helen. You're close enough to our family to
have that privilege."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Sure thing, Helen.</span> What would you
like?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'll have two slices of <span class=SpellE>margherita</span>
pizza, and Jake will have... what... 2 slices of supreme?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"4!" said Jake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jake! Your heart, remember? 3."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Done."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane, barely able to contain her excitement, turned to <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>, who was already sprinkling on toppings. "We are
going to absolutely kill it, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I know."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And on they went, as a consistent flow of customers came
through the doors of the Pizza King. There were a select few people who were
only curious as to who the new owners were, so they would walk in and walk out
again. But in the end, their first day in charge went pretty smoothly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since they had yet to determine a closing time, it wasn't
until <st1:time Minute="0" Hour="0">midnight</st1:time> that the customers
stopped coming and they were finally able to shut for the night. After locking
the doors and putting their earnings for the day in the safe, <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Jane sat in what was their favourite booth in
years past and started breaking down their first day in business over a couple
of leftover slices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Just like old times," said Jane, mouth full of pepperoni
pizza, "Except we never came here after <st1:time Minute="0" Hour="0">midnight</st1:time>.
This is new ground for us!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It wasn't like we didn't try," replied <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,
"We'd come here after a night at The <span class=SpellE>Zon</span>, but it was
always closed and we'd end up having to go to Cluster Burger instead. Anyway,
we're kind of getting off the subject."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"One we weren't even on to begin with. How do you think we
went?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Great. But there were a few complaints."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Let me guess... they didn't like the new Marinara sauce. We
can easily fix that by putting the grease back in. Marinara classic, the key
demos will love it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> raised an eyebrow. <span
class=GramE>"Key demos?</span> <span class=GramE>Really?</span> We're a pizza
restaurant, not a TV station."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Not yet we're not. Pizza King TV, all pizza, all the time,
24 hours a day right to your living room! You've got to look at the bigger
picture, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> chuckled slightly. "Well
there was that, but I was thinking more along the lines of waiting times. They
could be a lot better, in my opinion."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane took a sip of her cup of Ultra Cola and put her hand to
her chin in contemplation. "We should maybe think about recruiting another
person. I know you had trouble keeping up with demand today."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Only because you were taking the orders
way too fast.</span> I saw about 20 people off the side waiting for their
pizza."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Jane then sat silently
for a moment, feeling uneasy about the argument they had almost started.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I <span class=GramE>agree,</span> we need to hire someone."
said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, breaking the silence briefly, only to
bring on more silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Suddenly, Jane got up and took both her and <span
class=SpellE>Daria's</span> plates to the kitchen. As she came back, she threw
a sticky, beige ball of dough at the back of <span class=SpellE>Daria's</span>
head, knocking her glasses off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> put them back on and picked
the dough out of her hair, before standing and turning to her assailant. "What
the hell, Jane?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It was too tense in here," said Jane with a sheepish grin,
"So I'd thought I'd... you know... lighten things up with a doughy ambush."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> couldn't help but smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, it's on now."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She chased Jane into the kitchen, picked up a handful of
dough from the storeroom and hurled it at Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The resulting <span class=SpellE>doughfight</span> lasted a
whole hour. The cleanup took another two. By the time they arrived back at the <span
class=SpellE>Morgendorffers</span>, it was nearly 4 in the morning. Good thing
it was Saturday, and they didn't have to open until <st1:time Minute="0"
Hour="12">midday</st1:time>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That day they switched roles, with <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
taking the orders and the cash register, and Jane making the pizzas. This gave
Jane creative licence to arrange the toppings as she saw fit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hey, what gives?" yelled Sam Griffin as he and his friend
Brian Taylor received their pizza, "The toppings are arranged all...
arty-like."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's meant to be <span class=SpellE>Rodin's</span> Thinker,
Sam," said Rachel Landon, looking over it carefully from the booth next to
them, "For something that has been crafted solely out of onion slices, diced
bacon and pepperoni, the detail is amazing."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Cram your knowledge up your ass, brain!" Brian yelled as he
grabbed a slice, "Pizza is for eating, not for <span class=SpellE>arting</span>
up."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Easy on her, Brian," said Sam, picking up a slice of his
own, "Do you want Principal Defoe to give you that lecture again?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"<span class=SpellE>Pfft</span>! I've got something better
to give."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With that, he took a huge bite out of his slice, chewed it a
bit and then spat it out on Rachel's hair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"EWWWWWW!!!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Jane watched from afar
as Rachel ran crying to the bathroom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That runt needs a good boot up the rear end if you ask me,"
said Jane, shaking her head in disgust. "And I might just be the woman to do
it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With anger in her eyes and retribution on her mind, Jane
walked over to the booth where Sam and Brian were sitting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I saw what you did, young man," she said, pointing at
Brian, "And me and my friend don't like it one bit. I'm afraid I'm going to
have to ask you to leave."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brian arrogantly showed a theatrical expression of shock
before glaring at Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Make me, bitch."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With that, Jane grabbed Brian by the ear, gave it a twist
and forcefully dragged him out of the Pizza King.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Wait until I tell my dad about this!" Brian shouted, "He'll
sue your ass off!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"My friend's mother is the best lawyer in town. I dare you
and your daddy to try."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Do you even know who I am?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Yeah.</span> You're the jerk who spat up
pizza in some poor girl's hair and got himself banned for life from the Pizza
King. Now get out of my sight before I call the police!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brian stood still for a moment, before turning around and
walking off, flipping off Jane as he did so. When Jane walked back inside, there
were cheers from the other patrons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She suddenly stopped at the booth where Sam was still
sitting. "Were you with that boy?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I told him not to, I swear!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane looked him up and down before giving a quick nod.
"Good. You can stay."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, who was standing with
Rachel, was wide-eyed in shock. "Where the hell did all that come from?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I told you this already, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, <span
class=GramE>art college</span> can bring out the drill sergeant in anyone."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She then turned to Rachel. "You all right there?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah, I'm fine. Nothing a little shampoo can't fix."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Your pizza is on the house," said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,
reaching for her wallet, "I know it's not much, but..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I appreciate the thought, but I'd like to go home now
please."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With that, Rachel walked to the door and out. <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Jane watched her go before walking back to the
kitchen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I can't believe that he'd do something like that!" said
Jane as she took her position at the counter, "And then he has the grapefruits
to ask if I knew who he was!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I knew," said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, "He's <st1:State><st1:place>Brittany</st1:place></st1:State>
<st1:City><st1:place>Taylor</st1:place></st1:City>'s little brother."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well I can see why she moved to <st1:City><st1:place>Hollywood</st1:place></st1:City>.
I'd go insane having an annoying younger sibling around. You know the feeling."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"All too well."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The rest of that Saturday was uneventful. Unlike the
previous day, they managed to get everything cleaned up by <st1:time Minute="0"
Hour="0">midnight</st1:time>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They decided to stay closed on Sunday for two reasons. The
first was so they could prepare their ad looking for a new chef. The second was
simply to rest up their aching bodies. While <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
wrote the ad that put in the Lawndale Sun-Herald, Jane was designing small
posters with tear-off strips with Jane's <span class=SpellE>cellphone</span>
number on them, to be placed at both the Pizza King and Lawndale Mall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By Tuesday, those numbers were all gone. Unfortunately, most
of them were either prank callers asking about running fridges, canned Prince
Alberts and, in one case, a telemarketer trying to sell a book of clich&eacute;s.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By the next Friday morning, after exactly one week in
business, they were ready to interview the only two candidates they had left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"First is some guy named Arthur Simmons," said Jane, reading
off a resume, "And this says he has years of experience in this <span
class=GramE>field</span>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> laughed. "I think Arthur's
got this job in the bag. What time is he coming for the interview?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Any time now."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Wait a minute... Arthur. Surely not... <span class=GramE>Artie?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two friends looked at each other and screamed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> felt a cold shiver down her
spine. "I'd rather have Li work here than be around that creep!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I know... and that laugh of his... ugh! It makes my skin
crawl."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You know what I said before about how he has the job in the
bag? Forget it, he's gone."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Definitely."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They both watched in horror from the kitchen as a skinny,
red-haired man with freckles on freckles arrived at the door, walked in and
took a deep breath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Finally," Artie to no one in particular, "I'm home."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He started walking towards the counter, but when he saw <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Jane, his jaw dropped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh my God it's you two! You're those aliens!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> was dumbfounded. "Wait,
what?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"The aliens have taken the Pizza King! I must alert the
authorities!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With that, Artie sprinted for the door, pushing when he was
supposed to pull, then ran screaming down the street, arms flailing wildly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>Neither <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> or</span>
Jane could quite believe what just transpired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That went better than I expected, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So I guess we're going with the other applicant then?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Who is it?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane handed her the other resume and covered her ears,
expecting a tirade.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She didn't get one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't believe it. We're hiring him."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, he did help us," said Jane, shrugging her shoulders,
"It's the least we can do to repay him back, and if he says he's gotten better
in the last 3 years, then I say let's give him a chance."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"But this isn't home cooking. This is a business. If he screws
up, then we'll have lawsuits out the <span class=SpellE>wazoo</span> to take
care of."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane glared at <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. "Come on <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>. All our lives we've taken chances. If I didn't take
a chance on the bespectacled misfit sitting in front of me in that self-esteem
class, we wouldn't be here. If anything we'd still be there. If it weren't for
you giving me a push to send my art to BFAC, I wouldn't have my degree and we
definitely wouldn't be here. If it weren't for me walking up to Tom in <span
class=GramE>The</span> <span class=SpellE>Zon</span>..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"We'd still be on our first friendship, not our second."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"OK, bad example.</span> My point is<span
class=GramE>,</span> I think he deserves this chance. And I know you do too."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> stared at the door, and
watched as the very subject of their conversation walked in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"All right.</span> But he has to do
everything by the book. One wild jazz odyssey pizza and he's gone."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While Jane sat down with their new chef and took care of the
formalities, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> watched as she prepared that day's
dough and toppings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Just a bit of business we have to take care of before we
make it official. <span class=GramE>Any criminal convictions?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Once in <st1:City><st1:place>Boulder</st1:place></st1:City>,
but it was a long time ago."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Are you good with children?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sure! I love kids, as long as they don't cause any
trouble."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Any medical issues I should know about?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"One heart attack about 4-5 years ago and my doctor tells me
I have anger management issues. I don't believe him to be honest with you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Jane and the lucky applicant stood up and shook hands, <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> could only wonder what the hell they were getting
themselves into now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I guess all there is left to say is... welcome to the Pizza
King family, Mr. <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was half an hour before opening for Friday lunch, and <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Jane were showing Jake around his new workplace,
making sure that he knew where everything was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So what made you want to work here?" asked <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>, "Did they finally cancel the repeats of The Dukes <span
class=GramE>Of</span> <span class=SpellE>Hazzard</span> or something?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I was bored with consulting," Jake said with a sigh, "I've
been doing it since we moved to <st1:City><st1:place>Lawndale</st1:place></st1:City>
and it wears you down doing the same routine every day. My heart has always
been with my cooking, but my responsibility to you, your mom and Quinn meant
that I had to keep doing other jobs until I got better at it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So you're done with it completely?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"More or less, yes.</span> So, where do I
start? What do I have to do?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"We'll start you with cleaning and serving the customers. We
switch places every other day so when you get to making the pizzas, you'll
always have either me or Jane helping you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Can I at least do something with the food now?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> wasn't expecting that.
"Um... <span class=SpellE>er</span>..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You can knead the dough, Jake," said Jane, "That will give
me some time to put the new syrups into the soda fountain. That OK with you, <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sure. At least the dough is already made."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> went to check the clock, and
gasped when she saw that the big hand was nearly at the 10.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Wow, where did all the time go? We need to get that dough
kneaded fast!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'll see what I can do, but I'm not promising a miracle."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Jake sprinted to where a
large ball of dough was waiting on a flour covered counter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jake picked the ball up and looked it over. "A miracle is
pretty much what we need, I think."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Suddenly, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> got an idea.
"Pretend that dough is Mad Dog's face."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Without so much as another word, Jake threw the dough down
and started pounding it with animalistic fury. "Take that, old man! And that!
And a bit of this! I've wanted to do this to you for over 30 years!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> watched on, Jane walked
in from the eating area. "OK, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, the syrups are
in... what's up with Jake?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I've found a way to exploit his hatred for his dad that
benefits us all."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That day was the most efficient so far. With Jake at the
counter, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Jane could not only focus better
on the pizza, but generally cleaning up as well. The only complaints were from
people ringing up upset that Pizza King didn't deliver anymore.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next day was Jake's first turn in the kitchen, and he
and <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> were going to be making the pizzas while
Jane working the counter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Remember, dad," said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,
"We're taking specific orders here, so there won't be any kitchen sink stew
pizzas or stuff like that, OK?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Got it.</span> Wait, what if someone asks
for one?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Tell them the sink is being fixed and it can't be used
today."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First in line for service on that day was a familiar face.
Stacy Rowe, the formerly perpetually-stressed member of the Fashion Club. What
was once a tall, skinny young girl was now a tall, toned young woman, brimming
with <span class=GramE>confidence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh hey, um... <span class=GramE>Quinn's sister's friend.</span>
I didn't know you worked here."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane laughed. "It's <span class=GramE>OK,</span> a lot more
people than you think call me that. To answer your question, I don't. I'm
actually the co-owner."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh cool! Anyway, can I get four slices of <span
class=SpellE>meatlovers</span> <span class=GramE>pizza.</span> With extra meat
please."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Depends.</span> Do you have money?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stacy handed over a couple of paper bills. "This should do,
I hope."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Wait <span class=SpellE>wait</span> <span class=SpellE>wait</span>,"
interrupted <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> as she started spreading sauce on
Stacy's pizza, "<span class=SpellE>Meatlovers</span> pizza? I thought you'd be
on permanent diet because of the whole Fashion Club thing."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"<span class=SpellE>Pfft</span>! No way. We broke up at the
end of junior year. Didn't Quinn tell you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Probably, but I might not have been listening at the time."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Anyway, I need to get plenty of protein in me because I
need to build up muscle for my racing career."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane's jaw dropped. <span class=GramE>"Racing?</span> <span
class=GramE>Muscle?</span> Did you switch brains with a man in the last couple
of years or something?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, I'm finally chasing my dream. I'm going to be the first
woman to win the SCUSA Cup!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well we're rooting for you, girl," Jake said, before
turning to <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, giving a thumbs-up, "Your pizza
will be ready in 10 minutes."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Thanks!" said Stacy, before taking a seat at a table near
the Pizza King mural.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, meanwhile, was staring off
into the distance. "I used to have a dream once."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What was that, kiddo?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Nothing.</span> Now let's get to <span
class=GramE>putting</span> those toppings on."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Under <span class=SpellE>Daria's</span> watchful eye, Jake
started putting on the toppings carefully, making sure that he was putting on
enough of everything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"OK... make sure there's plenty of bacon... yes that's the
way... pepperoni... lots of that... now put on some ham and beef... good job...
you could be going a little bit faster you know."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, I'm going as fast as I
can!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Sorry... sorry.</span> Just the cheese to
go now... there we go...now put that into the oven... and we're done!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Yeah!</span> We made a pizza, <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Don't get carried away, Dad. We do this about a hundred
times a day so one pizza means nothing in the end."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jake's smile disappeared. "Oh. Well let's start making the
next one then."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Again, the day went smoothly. That night, the three of them
sat in a booth over some pizza to discuss their progress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Let's be honest," said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,
"We've been flying by the seat of our pants since we opened up nearly 2 weeks
ago. We had no earthly idea how to operate a pizzeria then, and not much has
changed."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All three of them started to chuckle, with Jake starting to
cough in the process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> continued. "But, we've
managed to make it work. Rent is getting paid on time, and according to the
financial records, profits are a little bit down, but in store revenue is
slightly above that of this time last year."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"And now that we have Jake on board," said Jane between sips
of her cola, "We might actually be able to get a night time delivery service
for the <st1:City><st1:place>Lawndale</st1:place></st1:City> area running again
sooner rather than later."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hey yeah!" said Jake excitedly, "I'm proving to be a quite
a difference maker for you two, aren't I?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Indeed you are," said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, "But
one thing you have to start doing is getting the pizzas made faster. I told you
about that today and I don't think I should have to keep reminding you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'll try, but I haven't got youth on my side like you and
Jane. Hey, while we're here, I have a suggestion for a new item on the menu..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"But you didn't..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's not you Jake," said Jane giving <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
a dirty look, "It's just that we're going to stick with the existing menu for
the first couple of months. Ain't that right, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Uh... yes. That's the reason."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"OK, sorry to bother you about it, kiddo." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next day was Sunday, so the Pizza King was closed.
However, that didn't stop Jane from confronting <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't get it, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. Why are
you being so hard on Jake?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm just trying to make sure that nothing goes wrong," <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> said in reply, "You know what his reputation is
like."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I think you're just refusing to believe that his reputation
might have changed for the better, and I can't for the life of me understand
why."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> sighed, as a clap of thunder
rumbled outside. "I know he's better than ever with his cooking, Jane. But I
just can't shake the feeling that something is going to wrong eventually."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next day, the rain came down hard as <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,
Jane and Jake went back to work. Again, it was <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
and Jake working on the pizzas with Jane at the counter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"All right, we have an order for three slices vegetarian and
two slices <span class=SpellE>margherita</span>," Jane said to her two chefs,
"Let's get them out here!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> passed the sauced base to
Jake and watched him put on the other toppings. "OK... there's the onion...
tomato... the... hey, watch what you're doing!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By then it was already too late. Jake had put a handful of
bacon on the vegetarian pizza.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Great," yelled <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, picking up
the pizza tray and slamming it down with a metallic clang that startled
everyone in the store, "Now we have to start all over!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm sorry, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, I swear it was
an accident..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, let's be glad that I caught it before it got served,"
she said as she started preparing the next pizza.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They wouldn't say another word until they were finished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After the pizzas had been served, Jane turned to <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I thought I told you not be so hard on him!" she yelled,
"Why are you still harassing him?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"He keeps stuffing up, Jane! I just knew he would!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You don't even give him a chance to stuff up, or do anything!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"But Jane..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Their talk would go unfinished as they were interrupted by a
woman's frantic voice. "Ariel <span class=GramE>are</span> you OK? <span
class=GramE>Ariel?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, Jane and Jake watched in
horror as a little girl fell out of her booth, gasping for air.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Her mother was beside herself with anguish. "She's choking!
Somebody help her, please!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Jane dialled 911, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> ran
over to the scene. "Does she need the Heimlich or something?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No! She swallowed it all right... maybe it was an allergic
reaction!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria's</span> first instinct was to pick
up the vegetarian pizza. "Was this hers?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"The vegetarian was mine! She was eating the cheese one!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> picked up a slice of the
pizza and took a bite. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> almost instantly spat it
out, having encountered an unexpected taste.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"This one has hot <span class=SpellE>chili</span> sauce
on..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Wait, did you say <span class=SpellE>chili</span>?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Uh... yeah."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh no, she's allergic to <span class=SpellE>chili</span>!
Her throat closes up and everything! Who would make a mistake like that?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> started to feel sick in her
stomach. It was then that she remembered that she was the one who puts the
sauces on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She was the one that screwed up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All of a sudden, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> ripped off
her apron and ran to the door, trying to ignore all the stares from the other
customers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jake, you stay here for the ambulance!" yelled Jane as she
followed her out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By the time she got out the door, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
had already disappeared into the rain. She fumbled for her <span class=SpellE>cellphone</span>
and rang <span class=SpellE>Daria's</span> number, only to get a message that
the number could not be reached.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> would keep running and running,
through the bucketing rain, past an ambulance heading in the opposite
direction, until she was back at home. There, she ran up the stairs and into
her old bedroom, her sanctuary of the past, which was now empty except for a
few boxes filled with her clothes and books.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At that moment, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> kicked off
her boots, sat down against the padding and started to cry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane didn't see <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> again until
she returned from the Pizza King. She slowly opened the bedroom door to find
her, sitting in the corner of the room, still in her damp clothes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I've just gotten off the phone with her father," said Jane
quietly, "You remember Nick that used to be in <span class=SpellE>Mystik</span>
Spiral, right?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Ariel is his daughter to his ex-wife. He said that her
mother won't press any charges of negligence as long as we cover Ariel's
medical bills."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>Silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"The Marinara sauce and the <span class=SpellE>chili</span>
sauce should never have been next to each other. That's on me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Still silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, these things happen. It's
OK..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No it's not OK!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sudden loudness of <span class=SpellE>Daria's</span>
response had Jane jumping in shock. "<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, it was an
accident. You had no idea that she was allergic to <span class=SpellE>chili</span>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I was so focused on what my dad was doing, telling him not
to screw up and do everything properly, that I forgot to watch what I was
doing."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So you made a mistake. These things happen..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"A girl nearly died, Jane! That doesn't just happen."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> sighed, trying not to let
her emotions overcome her again. "She nearly died because of me. Not because of
Dad. But because of me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She failed, and she started crying again. Jane knelt down
beside her and gave her a hug.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Neither of them noticed that Jake had been standing behind
them the entire time. "<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, are you OK?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Nothing a bullet wouldn't fix."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jake walked into the room, reached out his hand and helped <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> to her feet, before giving her a handkerchief. "Come
on now. There's no need to say stuff like that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> blew her nose into the
hankie and folded it away into her jacket pocket. "Thanks. I know<span
class=GramE>,</span> I just feel like crap right now."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Now you don't have to answer me if you don't want to, but
why do you feel like you have to be so... how do I put this... hands-on with
how I cook?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't mind. Cooking for your family is one thing. Cooking
for a bunch of strangers is something completely different. I just didn't want
anything to go wrong."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"To be honest, I don't blame you for thinking that I'm some
sort of buffoon in the kitchen. I mean, I've cooked some absolute disasters in
my time. <span class=GramE>That penne a la pesto?</span> What was I thinking?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> tried to stifle a laugh.
Jane didn't.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"But that's why I spent all my spare time trying to get
better," Jake continued, "So I wouldn't have my family become physically ill at
the mere idea of <span class=SpellE>ol</span>' <span class=SpellE>Jakey's</span>
cooking."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> took a breath and turned to
Jane, then to Jake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Dad, I'm sorry I was so hard on you at work."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I know. You were only doing what you thought was right in
your mind."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane watched as father and daughter embraced in the
moonlight shining through the barred windows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Um... <span class=GramE>Dad?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What is it, kiddo?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Can you let go, please? I can't breathe."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sure."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Jake let go of each
other, Jane was trying to stifle a laugh.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Keep it to yourself, Lane," said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,
raising a fist to her friend, "Or else you'll see how funny it is when your
next pizza is served to you in a cup."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I heard you say the other day that you had a dream once,"
said Jake, "What did you mean by that?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> wasn't expecting that
question. "I don't know really. I mean... the last thing I was expecting to do
with my life after college was run a pizza shop."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Did you want to run it?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Honestly, no."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Then why did you decide to go for it?" asked Jane, "More
importantly, why didn't you say anything to me?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I couldn't let Gino down. He entrusted his entire livelihood
in our hands, and like you said, we owed it to him that we at least tried. <span
class=GramE>That,</span> and the money isn't too bad either."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Yeah.</span> That warehouse apartment
down payment has been well and truly covered now. I can quit and paint all day
for the rest of my life if I want to."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No you can't. Three weeks of pizza money won't even last 6
months."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Whatever, I'm going to bed."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With that, Jane left the room and walked down the hall into
the guest room/Quinn's room to go to sleep. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and
Jake weren't too far behind her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, however, had one more
question, "What was your dream, Dad?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Me? Well... it's changed a lot over the years. Some of them
came true, like marrying your mother, becoming a father and outliving my <span
class=SpellE>fath</span>... um... some did and some didn't. But I only have one
simple dream to fulfil now. Then I can die a happy man. Wait... that's a poor
choice of words isn't it?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What is it?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"When it happens, you'll know. Good night, <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Night, Dad."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jake shut the bedroom door, leaving <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
alone to change out of her damp clothes and into a loose shirt and shorts, her
normal sleeping attire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Everything all right now?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> nearly fell down, Jane's
voice startling her. "Jane! Were you awake that entire time?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Don't worry. There's nothing you've got that I haven't got.
<span class=GramE>Except for that."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> picked up a pillow and
hurled it at Jane, hitting her with a soft thud.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I was talking about the glasses!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It wasn't long before they were both asleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next day was, thankfully for <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,
a whole lot less eventful than the day before. However, she was noticeably
downbeat. <span class=GramE>Even more so than usual.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An hour before closing time, Jane finally got some spare
time to talk to her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You're still feeling down about yesterday, aren't you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No. I'm over that. <span class=GramE>Just got a lot of
other stuff on my mind."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane put a comforting hand on <span class=SpellE>Daria's</span>
shoulder. "I think there's something you want to do, isn't there?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> looked into her friend's
eyes, then over at the mural of Gino.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's OK," said Jane, "He'd understand."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> walked over to the kitchen
sink, where Jake was busy drying plates and cups from the dishwasher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Um... <span class=GramE>Dad?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What is it, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm... giving you my stake in the Pizza King."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jake dropped a glass into the sink in shock. "Wait, what... why...
who?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"My heart's just not in it anymore. It never really was in
all honesty."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"But... all your plans for the future!</span>
What will happen to them?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's because of the future that I'm doing this. I want to
move on to other things, maybe get some use out of that degree I spent three
years of my life working for."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You sure this is want you want?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm sure."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> took off her apron, gave it
to Jake and sat down in a booth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>?" said Jake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Yes, dad?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Thanks. You have no idea how much this has all meant to
me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Any time."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So, what are you doing now?" asked Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"May as well wait for you guys to finish
up.</span> Besides, where else are you going to get a ride home at <st1:time
Minute="0" Hour="0">midnight</st1:time> on a Tuesday?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Good point."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jake put his arm around Jane. <span class=GramE>"Looks like
it's just you and me now, Jane-o."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"We will need to replace <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
eventually."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At that moment, the door opened and Claire Defoe, the former
art teacher at Lawndale High, walked into the Pizza King. Normally a wearer of
sundresses and big jewellery, Defoe was dressed in a manner more befitting her
new role as Principal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hello, Jane."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Ms. Defoe! What are you doing here?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Please, call me Claire. As for what I'm doing, I would like
2 slices of supreme and a small soda, please."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane reached into the oven and pulled a couple slices of
pizza, before handing her a cup. "You don't mind eating a third, do you? I
won't charge you for it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Not at all.</span> How did you end up
here, Jane? I thought you would have gone further with your painting."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I did get a degree from BFAC, but then the old owner of
this place died and gave it to me and <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. You
remember <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, don't you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Of course," Defoe replied, giving <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
a wave. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> sheepishly waved back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"So, what about you?</span> You look
great, by the way."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Thanks. I became principal at Lawndale High about a year
ago when Ms. Li mysteriously vanished. Since then I've gone through a whole lot
of art teachers, trying to find the right one to replace me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sounds like a job offer."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No... I can't make you quit this job... Jane..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before Defoe had a chance to finish her sentence, Jane had
taken off her apron and handed it to Jake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Wow," he said to himself, "I'm going to need some more
chefs."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I wouldn't necessarily do that yet, Jane," said Defoe, "There's
still an interview process to go through. But between you and me, if you're
still half as good as you were 3 years <span class=GramE>ago,</span> you'll be
a shoe-in."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Thanks, Claire."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With that, Defoe picked up her plate of pizza and her cup,
and went over to the soda fountain to fill it up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane," said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, "You know you
forgot to charge her for the pizza."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"<span class=SpellE>Dammit</span> I did too... ah, don't
worry about it. One meal won't ruin us."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jake walked up to the two girls, still holding their aprons.
"So I take it I'm sole owner now?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"If I get this job at Lawndale High," replied Jane, "Then
yes."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"All right!</span> I own my own
restaurant! <span class=GramE>All by myself!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jake threw the apron and pointed a fist to the ground. "You
hear that, old man? That's the sound of little <span class=SpellE>Jakey</span>
becoming a bigger success than you!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Jane took one last look
at the mural of Gino, then back at Jake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Do you think he'll be all right, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>?"
asked Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At that moment, Jake saw the girls looking at him. His angry
face turned into a happy one as he waved at them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They both waved back. "He'll be just fine."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With that, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and Jane left the
Pizza King for the last time as its owners, got into their car and waited for
Jake to finish up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>EPILOGUE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"Mom!</span> Dad! <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>!
I'm home!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Quinn! You made it for Thanksgiving!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn dropped her suitcases and embraced her mother. <span
class=GramE>"Mom!</span> I wouldn't miss it for the world. You know that! <span
class=GramE>Hey, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hey," said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, looking up from
her writing, "How was the flight?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"The seats were way too small, the water wasn't even cold,
and the movie they showed on the plane was terrible, with no romance in it
whatsoever!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"In other words, nothing out of the
ordinary."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn sat down next to her sister and gave her a hug, which <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> accepted reluctantly. "So how's your new job?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's all right. Writing for Sick, Sad World isn't overly
inspiring, but the money's good and there is plenty of room for career
advancement."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"And how's Jane?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Why ask her, when you can ask me?" said Jane, walking into
the room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm doing great! The kids at <st1:City><st1:place>Lawndale</st1:place></st1:City>
might all be becoming increasingly like Kevin..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Now don't you be knocking Kevin," said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,
"He may be a moron, but he makes some damn good ice-cream."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I hear that. As I was saying, there are some idiots, but
there are a couple of kids there that really have a mind for art. Sometimes,
they even inspire me in my artwork."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Great. I never thought you'd want to go back there,
though."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You'd be surprised how much of that was associated to how
Li ran the place. Defoe's iron fist is well manicured and a lot more pleasant."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn saw Helen standing off the side of the room, watching
the three <span class=GramE>girls</span> converse. "How's retirement from the
law firm treating you, Mom?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, I'm not fully retired. I still pitch in at the Pizza
King <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>somedays</span></span> for your father.
He's doing unbelievable business there, you know."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>"How good?</span> Maybe I can help him out
and triple his profit margins or something."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm sure he'll love that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At that moment, Jake poked his head through the doorway.
"Dinner's ready! Hope you brought your stomachs!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The four women walked into the dining room, and their jaws
collectively dropped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the dining room table in front of them sat a large
turkey, cooked to perfection. On plates surrounding it were cranberry sauce,
stuffing, mashed potato and gravy, assorted vegetables and a large pumpkin pie.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn rubbed her eyes, in an almost-<span class=SpellE>cartoonish</span>
manner. "This is great, Dad! I can't believe how good you are at cooking stuff
now."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I can hardly believe it myself," said <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,
"To <span class=GramE>think,</span> only a few years ago the man had trouble
cooking toast. Now he's cooked a Thanksgiving feast."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffers</span> took their
seats around the table, Jake walked in with a large fork and carving knife,
ready to go.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Is there anything anyone would like to say before we start
eating?" asked Helen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"If you wouldn't mind," said Jake, "I have a few words."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He looked over the table, his loving <span class=GramE>wife,</span>
his two wonderful daughters and a woman that had become almost like a third daughter
to him. It took everything in him to stop himself from crying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'll keep it short, because I know how much you're all
looking forward to this. I'm thankful for having such a wonderful loving
family. And that includes you Jane."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane blushed slightly. "I know where you live, <span
class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"As of right now, I can finally say that my life cannot be
any better."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As he started carving the turkey, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
got a good look at her father's face. She could never remember seeing him so
look so happy in all his life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She could tell then and there, that his dream just came
true.</p>
