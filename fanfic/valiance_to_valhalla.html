<p class=MsoNormal>Summary:&nbsp; The Lawndale High students face endless madness
when a freak snow storm traps them inside the school.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; this is <b>not </b>a
parody of "The Day After Tomorrow."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>By the way this day started, I should have suspected that
it would end up like this.&nbsp; I must be losing my touch.&nbsp; Either that or the cold
is getting to me...&nbsp; </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>7:00 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; earlier that morning</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>"And that was 'what you give' by Tesla coming at you from
Zeeeeeeeeee-93 in the morning!"</i> came the voice of the Spatula Man from the
radio sitting on the kitchen table.&nbsp; <i>"It's looking pretty nasty out there
folks.&nbsp; There is a report of at least two and a half feet of snow and most of
the main roads are blocked off."</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Morgendorffer family was gathered at the kitchen table
eating breakfast and listening to the radio report.&nbsp; It had been snowing for
hours the day before and by the sound of it, didn't stop when night came.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>"That's right Spatula Man," </i>said Bing, the other disc
jockey, <i>"and the snow is showing no signs of stopping any time soon."</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Do you think school will be canceled?" Quinn asked
sleepily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Not likely," replied Daria, "Li wouldn't cancel school for
anything less than Armageddon.&nbsp; Even then, only if her security cameras went
out."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hush, girls.&nbsp; I'm trying to listen to the weather," said
Helen.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>"All interstates are closed, and the National Guard has
been deployed to help those foolish enough to get caught on the highways.&nbsp;
Other residential and city roads are being assaulted by the salt trucks, but it
looks grim for anything to be open today."</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Damn it!" exclaimed Helen.&nbsp; "I won't be able to get to the
office."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Neither will I," added Jake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>"All schools in the county are closed with one
exception.&nbsp; In an unbelievable show of determination, or stupidity, Lawndale High has remained open for today."</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You've got to be kidding me!" cried Quinn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"She is.&nbsp; Ms. Li is just playing a cruel joke on us all,"
said Daria, though she knew this would happen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Mom, can we just stay home today?&nbsp; You can't expect me to
actually go to school with this much snow.&nbsp; The cold air could ruin my skin!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah, hypothermia doesn't even come close to the trauma of
damaged skin," joked Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"See, even Daria agrees with me," said Quinn, not picking up
on Daria's sarcasm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Now, you know how I feel about you girls missing school,"
said Helen.&nbsp; "Even in these less than ideal conditions, you shouldn't take your
education for granted."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You don't expect us to walk to school do you?" asked a very
irritated Quinn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You can take the SUV," said Helen handing Daria the keys.&nbsp;
"I won't be needing it today.&nbsp; Will you be ok driving, Daria."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No problem, captain," said Daria giving Helen a salute.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen continued with a sigh, "You can pick up your friends,
too, if they need a ride.&nbsp; Just drive slowly.&nbsp; This kind of weather makes the
roads unpredictable."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"This isn't fair," complained Quinn.&nbsp; "You guys get to stay
home."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's different for us, Quinn," said Jake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"How?" asked Quinn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, it's like this.&nbsp; Um, uh...," said Jake, trying to
explain.&nbsp; "We... uh."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Dad?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hey, is that the loose floorboard I hear?" asked Jake
running away from the table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's different for us because we won't be grounded if we
miss work," said Helen.&nbsp; "Now, you girls better get going." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Fine," said a defeated Quinn, knowing that trying to reason
with her mom wouldn't work.&nbsp; She and Daria left the kitchen and slowly trudged
to the garage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The garage door opened, allowing the SUV to back out.&nbsp; It
was one thing to hear about it on the radio, but seeing the weather conditions
first hand was astonishing.&nbsp; The sky was dark grey, on the borderline of black
in fact.&nbsp; The thick snowfall made for visibility of less than four feet, which
made driving a daredevil stunt.&nbsp; Walking would have been just as dangerous.&nbsp;
Daria progressed slowly down the street, moving even more timidly than when she
first learned to drive.&nbsp; This is one of the few times that she heeded one of
her mother's warnings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You don't need to pick up any of my friends, they already
have rides," said Quinn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, Jane doesn't.&nbsp; So we're going to pick her up before
we go to school."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria turned onto Jane's street and approached her house.&nbsp;
When they reached casa Lane, Daria exited the car and made her way to the front
door.&nbsp; She almost fell a couple of times due to all the ice, but she managed to
stay on her feet.&nbsp; Several moments after ringing the bell, a very haggard
looking Jane answered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Now that you've applied the proper amount of makeup, are
you ready to go to school?" asked Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Who said anything about going to school?" asked Jane
through yawns.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"If I have to suffer, so do you.&nbsp; Let's go."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Since when has misery loved company?" asked Jane.&nbsp; When
Daria didn't respond, she just grabbed her backpack walked to the car with
Daria following.&nbsp; It was too early to argue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once in the car, Daria, Quinn, and Jane made their way to
the school.&nbsp; Tired of hearing weather reports, Daria changed the station on the
radio.&nbsp; The speakers began to blare out "nowhere to go" by mushroomhead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Mornings gone</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Echoes of dawn</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Shaking my soul</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>All but done</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Delirium</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>The rain with the cold</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Nowhere to go</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Ugh, why are we listening to this?" asked Quinn.&nbsp; This
obviously didn't compliment her taste in music.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Just something for mom the next time she starts the car,"
said Daria.&nbsp; "I'm sure she'll appreciate us leaving it on this station and
turning the volume all the way up."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh," said Quinn realizing that this would be a suitable
revenge for their mom sending them to school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>(We've been brought here for a reason</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>be it fate or internal treason</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Helen is so lucky to have such caring daughters as
yourselves," said Jane sardonically.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>If I could end this waking dream</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Escape through a scream</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>And feel I'd won some way</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>...</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>I should have seen that song on the radio this morning as
foreshadowing.&nbsp; Like I said, the cold is getting to me.&nbsp; I can barely think
straight.&nbsp; Going through an entire day of school didn't help much either...</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>8:09 AM</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When they finally arrived at the school, it was evident that
most kids didn't even bother to show up today.&nbsp; Daria and Jane's first period English
class had less than half the normal amount of people in it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I think it's just wonderful that you all braved the
elements just to make it to school.&nbsp; You stared that snow right in the face and
said 'I'm not going to miss out on my education because of you!'"&nbsp; Being met
with a class full of blank faces didn't discourage Mr. O'Neil from going on.&nbsp;
"I'm just so proud of you all!&nbsp; Unfortunately, I wasn't expecting us to have
class today, so I have no lessons planned."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What a tragedy that is," said Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It is, isn't it?" said O'Neil, not picking up on Jane's
sarcastic tone.&nbsp; "I guess you can all use this as a quiet reading time for your
novels."&nbsp; This idea is met by moans of disapproval from the class.&nbsp; "If you
don't want to do that, we can all discuss our feelings about the complex
emotions displayed in 'Pride and Prejudice.'"&nbsp; At the thought of this, everyone
in the class pulls out their novels and begin to read (or at least pretend
to).&nbsp; The rest of first period goes by without incident.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Second period with Ms. Barch didn't fare well either.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I guess actually driving here through the death blizzard
wasn't enough, huh?&nbsp; I have to be punished even further by having the males
show up today," ranted Ms. Barch.&nbsp; "Your lesson for today is global warming,
and why it is responsible for this freak storm.&nbsp; If all of the brain dead men
of the world didn't have to drive their big, road hogging trucks and SUV's,
thereby releasing so much carbon dioxide into the air, none of this would have
ever happened.&nbsp; It's. All. Your. faults!" she yelled, slapping her ruler
against the desk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I should probably wait until she leaves to go to the SUV,"
thought Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Shut up, Mack!" yelled Ms. Barch to a confused Mack.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The rest of the day went by as if it were the last day of
school.&nbsp; In every class, the teacher seemed to care less than the students.&nbsp;
History was the worst, because Mr. DeMartino was no where to be found.&nbsp; Most
suspected that he was stuck in his car somewhere bulging his eye out.&nbsp; The
ringing of the final bell was a godsend to the students.&nbsp; Everyone left class
and went to their lockers in anticipation of going home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"My mom is going to pay for making me go through these seven
hours of hell," said Daria to Jane as they were making their way to their
lockers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I should make you pay for dragging me here with you," said
Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Now you know you don't mean that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"All threats aside, this weather does have me a little
concerned," said Jane.&nbsp; "Do you think Ms. Barch was on to something when she
said that global warming was responsible for this storm?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm no meteorologist, but even coming from Ms. Barch, it
does sound plausible," replied Daria.&nbsp; "Either that, or the gas companies are
thinking up some damn creative ways to keep profits up."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, whatever it is, it better end soon.&nbsp; Even Trent won't be able to sleep through it when we can't pay the gas bill."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They stopped at their lockers and gathered their things.&nbsp;
When that was done, Daria and Jane left to meet up with Quinn so they could
finally go home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>AAAAAAAGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The halls were silenced by the sound of a shrill, and
squeaky, scream.&nbsp; The source of said scream was from none other than Brittany.&nbsp; Daria, Jane, Kevin, and the other LHS regulars gathered around Brittany, shocked
at what they saw before them.&nbsp; The doors leading outside were completely
blocked by snow, with some of it poured into the hall because of Brittany opening the door.&nbsp; Some students tried to dig their way out, but their efforts
were futile.&nbsp; The snow might as well have been a mile thick and high enough to
cover the top of the door, so any attempts at digging out seemed hopeless.&nbsp;
Just then, Ms. Li came over the intercom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Attention students, I regret to inform you that due to
heavy snowfall, all of the entranceways to the school are blocked.&nbsp; As of now,
we have no way out of the building, so everyone is going to have to remain here
until told otherwise.&nbsp; A call has already been made out, and it is only a
matter of time before the National Guard comes to dig us out.&nbsp; Until then,
remain calm and stay in the classrooms.&nbsp; And, don't even think about leaving
from the rooftop door.&nbsp; It's less than 20 degrees out there.&nbsp; You'll never make
it more than 10 feet alive.&nbsp; That is all."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The students began to panic.&nbsp; Many were trying to think of
ways to get out of the school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Don't worry guys," said Kevin.&nbsp; "We just need to wait for a
silo full of salt to crash down in front of the school, and we'll be out just
like that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Dude, you need to quit watching The Simpson's," said Mack.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What, it worked for them, didn't it?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mack just sighed and walked away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Was it something I said, bro?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>...</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>It all went downhill from there.&nbsp; Or, continued to go
downhill is a better way to put it.&nbsp; In an attempt by the teachers to try and
keep some order, they put us all in the auditorium.&nbsp; There, they just repeated
Li's speech about how the National Guard was on their way to rescue us from our
impending doom.&nbsp; It was all just a matter of time, or so they said...</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3:16 PM</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All of the students are gathered in the auditorium with some
of the teachers and other faculty members.&nbsp; In total, there are probably no
more than fifty kids there.&nbsp; Everyone is in their usual lunchroom clique
divisions, talking amongst themselves.&nbsp; Some are trying to use their cell
phones to call their families, but by the looks of it no one can get a signal.&nbsp;
Daria and Jane are, of course, sitting by themselves in the back of the
auditorium.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't know what I did in my past life to deserve this,"
said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Don't be ridiculous, Daria," said Jane.&nbsp; "This is obviously
punishment for something that you're going to do.&nbsp; And, by the looks of it, I'm
going to be there when it happens." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the other side of the room, near the stage, Quinn and
Sandi are sitting together.&nbsp; The other FC's didn't seem to show up to school
today.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"This is like, such a waste of time," complained Sandi.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I know," agreed Quinn.&nbsp; "We were supposed to go to the mall
after school today.&nbsp; This is so unfair!&nbsp; Why did mom have to send me to school
today?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I guess Stacy and Tiffany faked sick or something."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I hope the National Guard comes here soon.&nbsp; If they don't,
we might be here all night."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Don't worry, Quinn.&nbsp; I bet they're outside digging right
now."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sandi's words of confidence were short lived.&nbsp; As soon as
she finished speaking, the power went out.&nbsp; A few flickers of light made their
presence with the help of the backup generator.&nbsp; But, soon it was dark again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Now there's a sign of good things to come," said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You're always the optimist aren't you?&nbsp; Hey, is it getting
colder in here?" asked Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Now that you mention it, it does feel a little chilly all
of a sudden.&nbsp; How much do you want to bet that the heating was somehow
connected with the electricity?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Is there anything that maintenance department can't do
wrong?" retorted Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The teachers tried to calm down the students, but none could
be heard through all the concerned chatter.&nbsp; With no power, the microphone on
the stage podium wasn't working.&nbsp; Eventually, Ms. Li came out with a flashlight
and a megaphone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Attention everyone," yelled Li through the screeching
megaphone.&nbsp; The harsh noise was enough to shut everyone up.&nbsp; "Due to a
technical failure, the power will be out for quite some time.&nbsp; Also, due to
another completely <b><i>un</i></b>related technical failure, the heat will be
out as well.&nbsp; I suggest that you all put on as much clothes as you can and
huddle together for warmth.&nbsp; National Guard is still on their way and we will
all be home shortly," said Li reassuringly.&nbsp; "It will just take a lot longer
without the homing beacon functioning," she said under her breath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Upon Ms. Li's departure, all of the students began to put on
gloves, hats, and anything else that they had to keep them warm.&nbsp; It seemed to
be getting colder in the auditorium after every passing minute.&nbsp; However,
everyone was reluctant to huddle together.&nbsp; Daria and Jane didn't even move
from where they were sitting.&nbsp; After yet another speech from the teachers about
the National Guard and what not, things began to calm down.&nbsp; The students
continued to talk amongst themselves, none seeming too worried about the
circumstances before them.&nbsp; Though, it was still easy to sense the anxiety in
the air.&nbsp; From even inside the auditorium, the eerie sound of howling wind
could be heard.&nbsp; Though there were no windows, everyone knew that it was still
snowing.</p>

There's a poem in there somewhere.&nbsp; But, right now I'm not in a mood to care.&nbsp;
We've been here for hours, and I have yet to hear the sound of a hundred guys
with snow plows and shovels digging a pathway to our freedom.&nbsp; So far, the
mental constitutions of everyone trapped in here are holding out surprisingly
well.&nbsp; No one's tried to kill anyone yet, at least.&nbsp; As for me and Jane, we're
not doing badly either, considering the people we're cooped up with.&nbsp; Jane has
come up with some rather profound sketches.&nbsp; And me, well, writing this is
obviously what I'm doing.&nbsp; We just need to try and keep ourselves busy, or risk

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By now, everyone is starting to get hungry.&nbsp; All of the
students were rounded up and taken to the cafeteria for something to eat.&nbsp;
However, the lack of electricity made cooking the food impossible.&nbsp; The only
things available to eat now were canned fruits, bread, and candy from the
vending machines.&nbsp; Anything else available, if eaten uncooked, would result in
horrible sickness, and that was the last thing anyone needed.&nbsp; Though, not
happy with the limited selection, most everyone was too hungry to care.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In another part of the building, Ms. Li's office to be
exact, there was another dilemma being fused.&nbsp; Ms. Li sat in her darkened
office alone, with a portable heater stationed next to her desk.&nbsp; She spoke on
a HAM radio with someone who we can't immediately identify.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What do you mean you're delaying our rescue?" yelled Li.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"We've got emergencies popping up all over this city," said
Captain Hark, the National Guardsman that Li is talking to.&nbsp; "We're in over our
heads here.&nbsp; Even if we had the time, we won't be able to get the plows and
other necessary equipment there until morning."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"But, you don't understand, Captain Hark.&nbsp; It's my fault
that these kids are stuck here in the first place.&nbsp; If I would have just
cancelled school today, none of this would be happening.&nbsp; My students are
counting on you to get us out of here alive!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Maybe you should have thought of that this morning," said
an annoyed Hark.&nbsp; He had a lot of work to do and Ms. Li was holding him up.&nbsp;
"Look, as soon as we're done here, I'll send some people over to the school to
get started.&nbsp; If things go according to plan, you'll be out of there by
tomorrow afternoon.&nbsp; Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"But --," Captain Hark got off of his radio before Ms. Li
could finish what she was going to say.&nbsp; "Damn it!"&nbsp; Li slammed the radio
receiver onto her desk.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Back in the lunch room, everyone was finishing up their
"meals."&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"This sucks," complained Quinn.&nbsp; She sat at a table with
Sandi and the three J cronies.&nbsp; "Why couldn't they just start a fire or
something so they could give us some cooked food instead of this canned
stuff?"&nbsp; The three J's took this as another opportunity to try and cater to
Quinn's every whim.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'll start a fire for you Quinn!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, you'll screw it up. I'll do it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, you both suck at making fires."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Don't bother guys," interjected Sandi.&nbsp; "Even if you could
get a fire started, the sprinklers would just put it out."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The three J's gave looks of dejection, realizing that they
missed an opportunity to impress Quinn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Its ok guys," said Quinn.&nbsp; "Which one of you would like to
go and get me a soda?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I will!" said all three J's in unison.&nbsp; They got up and ran
towards one of the vending machines.&nbsp; As they run, they pass by Daria and
Jane's table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Why are they in such a hurry?" asked Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Maybe Quinn convinced them to try and dislodge the snow by
running full speed into the doors," said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It would be a lot easier to just crack open Kevin's head
and let the hot air melt the snow."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, that's his only method of keeping warm."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah, and we'd probably need more than one of him to melt
it all."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They're interrupted by the sound of glass shattering.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What kind do you want Quinn?" shouted Jeffy, standing on
top of the shattered remains of the glass covering of the vending machines.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>...</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Jane had a point.&nbsp; We would need more than one air head
to melt all the snow.&nbsp; If we combined Joey, Jeffy, and Jamie's combined air
power with Kevin, they could melt the Arctic twice...</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After they ate, everyone returned to the auditorium.&nbsp;
Besides Joey, Jeffy, and Jamie getting yelled at by Ms. Li for breaking the
vending machine, nothing really exciting happened for the rest of the night.&nbsp;
By this time, everyone was asleep.&nbsp; Old pieces of carpet, tarps, and anything
else suitable were used as blankets.&nbsp; The arrival of nighttime made it even
colder.&nbsp; In the back of the auditorium, there is a small tarp with a large lump
in the middle, indicating that someone is sitting up under it.&nbsp; Inside is none
other than Daria.&nbsp; She turns on the flashlight that she took from one of the
sleeping teachers and opens her notebook.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>I have officially entered my second day of hell.&nbsp; They
say that people come together in times of crisis, but I have yet to see this
happen here.&nbsp; No one is coming together, sharing inspirational words, or even
asking how the other person is doing.&nbsp; It's just like a prolonged day of school.&nbsp;
Though, I'm not surprised.&nbsp; Expecting these people to act differently would
have been foolish.&nbsp; The only thing keeping me from destroying them all is
having Jane here to keep me sane.&nbsp; I'm starting to feel more and more fortunate
that I dragged her here with me, though I don't know if I can say the same for
her.&nbsp; I'll have to watch my back.&nbsp; She could get some well deserved revenge on
me at any moment.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Her thoughts were interrupted by what sounded like footsteps
and other banging on the roof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sounds like the National Guard finally showed up," thought
Daria.&nbsp; "It's about time."&nbsp; She closed her notebook and turned off the
flashlight, placing it in her pocket.&nbsp; Daria then took off her glasses and put
them on top of the notebook.&nbsp; Lying down on her back, she looked up at the
ceiling for a few moments, and then closed her eyes.&nbsp; Sleep was a welcomed
friend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>5:37 AM</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ms. Li lay asleep in her office chair.&nbsp; The portable heater
still on, and the HAM radio off, Li slept comfortably and undisturbed.&nbsp; That
is, until her office door began to open slightly.&nbsp; A dark figure slowly
approached the desk.&nbsp; The figure moved closer towards Ms. Li, so that their
face was only inches away from hers.&nbsp; Then, without warning...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"COMFORTABLE!" yelled the mysterious stranger, jolting Ms.
Li awake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Back in the auditorium, everyone was still sleeping.&nbsp; The
sounds of the National Guard hard at work echoed from the rooftop.&nbsp; In the back
of the auditorium, a small beam of light penetrated an opening door.&nbsp; Then, a
dark figure looking the same as the one that entered Li's office entered the
room.&nbsp; The person cautiously approached the two kids who were on the floor
sleeping.&nbsp; Daria began to stir; the glare from a flashlight shining in her face
woke her from her slumber.&nbsp; Standing above her was a tall man with a
flashlight.&nbsp; The man picked up Daria's glasses and handed them to her.&nbsp; When
she put them on, she saw who it was standing before her.&nbsp; But, before Daria
could say anything, the lights flickered back on, waking everyone up.&nbsp; Ms. Li
soon came on stage, megaphone in hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Wake up! Everyone wake up!" shouted Ms. Li over the
megaphone.&nbsp; "A pathway out of the school has been carved.&nbsp; Everyone, get up and
proceed to the loading dock entrance."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The jubilated students all hurriedly got up and made their
way to the loading dock.&nbsp; Once there, they saw the door opened, and a pathway
dug out to the parking lot.&nbsp; The students all exited the building, taking their
first breaths of fresh air in almost twenty four hours.&nbsp; When Daria reached the
door, she noticed something that no one else seemed to realize.&nbsp; There wasn't a
single National Guardsman to be found.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>6:01 AM</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The dark grey sky gave way for the sun to rise over the
horizon as the now freed students celebrated in the parking lot.&nbsp; Some of them
throwing snowballs, making snow angels, and talking amongst each other.&nbsp; It
looked like the scene from a winter party.&nbsp; The snow had finally stopped
falling, and a cascading wind filled the dry air.&nbsp; Many of the kids called
their parents to tell them that they were alright.&nbsp; Daria stood near her
mothers SUV watching the festivities.&nbsp; She was joined by the man that woke her
up in the auditorium.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"How are you doing, Daria?" asked the man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"A lot better than I was half an hour ago, Mr. DeMartino,"
replied Daria.&nbsp; "Though, I wasn't expecting to see you when the lights came
back on."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I thought I would surprise you.&nbsp; It felt pretty good giving
Ms. Li a scare in her office."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"There's something I can't figure out, though.&nbsp; Why did you
come to save us?" asked Daria.&nbsp; Mr. DeMartino was the last person she expected
to go out of his way to rescue someone.&nbsp; Especially considering that the
students were one of the main sources of his stress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, I was on my way to school this morning when my car got
stuck in a ditch on the highway.&nbsp; After the National Guard pulled my car out, I
overheard two of those imbeciles discussing the school.&nbsp; I heard them say that
there were students and teachers stuck in there.&nbsp; At first, it was my dream
come true.&nbsp; But, then I remembered you, Daria.&nbsp; I called your house to see if
you were home, but your mother told me that you and your sister went to
school."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You can blame her for that," said Daria.&nbsp; "It's my mom's
fault that I couldn't take my education for granted."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"To answer your question as to why I rescued the children;
you, Daria, must be one of my only students who can actually think for
themselves.&nbsp; Your sister's starting to show some promise as well.&nbsp; Students
like you are one of the few things that actually make teaching worthwhile.&nbsp; I
knew I had to do something to help you.&nbsp; Knowing that National Guard, it would
be days before they got you out.&nbsp; So I took it upon myself to do the job
right."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"But how did you manage to get in?" asked Daria.&nbsp; "You don't
have anywhere near the type of equipment the National Guard has, not to mention
the numbers."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Ah, yes.&nbsp; But I have something they don't.&nbsp; The ability to
think logically.&nbsp; A friend of mine who owns his own contracting company let me
borrow his snow plow equipped truck, as well as some supplies.&nbsp; I drove to the
school, and found that due to an overhanging roof, the loading dock door wasn't
blocked by snow, therefore making it easily accessible.&nbsp; Using some portable
heaters and a pick axe, I was able to bust my way through the door in a matter
of a few hours.&nbsp; As far as I know, the National Guard is still trying to dig
their way through the front entrance."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't know how to thank you, Mr. DeMartino.&nbsp; You may have
saved my sanity as well as my life."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You've already thanked me more than enough Daria.&nbsp; A
student like you comes by only once in a lifetime."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two were soon approached by Jane and Quinn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What do you say we get out of here?&nbsp; It's getting a little
too warm and fuzzy for me," said Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sure.&nbsp; I'm going to have to face the barrage of hugs from
my mother eventually.&nbsp; Let's go."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Goodbye girls," said Mr. DeMartino.&nbsp; "I'll see you in class
soon."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Bye, Mr. D," said Daria as he walked away.&nbsp; She joined
Quinn and Jane in the SUV, and they were soon on the road home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>"Well folks, it looks like the blizzard of the century
has finally come to an end," </i>came the voice of Bing through the radio on
the kitchen table.&nbsp; <i>"The roads have been cleared of almost all snow and ice,

reopened for business, and things are finally returning to normal after five
days of snowy insanity."</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just as Daria predicted, her and Quinn were welcomed home on
Wednesday by a barrage of hugs from their parents.&nbsp; Though, she couldn't blame
them for being concerned.&nbsp; Even if she wouldn't admit it, Daria <b>was</b>
worried about her parents and Quinn as well during her night of hell.&nbsp; The next
day, everyone enjoyed a day off as the town was still being cleaned up of the
mess left by the blizzard.&nbsp; However, their vacation from school was a short
one, as classes were back in session the next day.&nbsp; Much to the dismay of Daria
and Quinn, Helen was still making them go.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"But mo-ooom, are you seriously willing to take this risk
again?" asked Quinn, very peeved about the fact that they had to go back to
school so soon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Now Quinn, I doubt that you'll be stuck in the school
again.&nbsp; It hasn't snowed since Wednesday morning, and I think that this
blizzard is over," said Helen, who was back in her usual morning rush routine
again.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"This is so unfair!" pouted Quinn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Quinn, I don't have time to discuss this with you any
longer.&nbsp; I have a ton of work at the office to catch up on in very little
time.&nbsp; I have to go now, goodbye," said Helen as she ran into the garage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Can you believe this Daria?" asked Quinn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria just smirked, as she knew what was coming.&nbsp; After a
moment of silence, very loud music can be heard coming from the garage.&nbsp; Inside
the SUV, Helen shields her ears as the car radio, with the volume up all the
way, blares out heavy metal music.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Authors notes:</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First of all, my apologies to Roger E. Moore.&nbsp; I unwittingly
used his idea from "Winter in Hell," in which he stated the time throughout the
story.&nbsp; I hope that this can be considered for what it is, my sincerest form of
flattery.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The inspiration for the title of this story came after
reading Peter W. Guerin's essay "Daria Fandom's Gotterdaemmerung."&nbsp; In this
essay he makes a reference to the opera called "The Ring of the Nibelung," in
which part of the setting is castle Valhalla.&nbsp; Valhalla (Hall of the Slain), in
Norse mythology, is Odin's home for those who met glorious death in battle.&nbsp;
The title of this fic is a reference to the bravery of Mr. DeMartino (Valiance)
in rescuing the people who are trapped in the school (Valhalla).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kevin's "The Simpson's" reference: (warning: contains
spoilers)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In an episode of "The Simpson's," Bart and Lisa are trapped
in the school with the other students and Principal Skinner.&nbsp; They are rescued
when Homer and Ned, while attempting to save the students, crash into a salt
silo at the top of a hill.&nbsp; The silo falls down the hill and comes to a stop in
front of the school.&nbsp; The silo spills its load of salt, which melts all of the
snow blocking the door.&nbsp; For anyone who hasn't seen this episode, sorry if I
ruined the ending for you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Barch's rant on global warming:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do I believe that global warming is a problem?&nbsp; I believe
that it will be if it continues to go unchecked.&nbsp; I used to think that global
warming was just a joke, but after researching the subject, I began to open my
eyes to the problem at hand.&nbsp; It does seem to be a serious threat to the
stability of mankind.&nbsp; If what scientists and meteorologists are saying turns
out to be true, at some point in time "The Day After Tomorrow" will become a
documentary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ms. Li shows remorse?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In one small scene in this fic, while Ms. Li is talking to
Captain Hark of the National Guard, she states that it's her fault that the
students are trapped in the school.&nbsp; Though, it's not likely that Li would
blame herself for anything, I just wanted to try and show that she <i>could </i>have
a conscience.&nbsp; Or, I could go so far as to say she cares for her students and
faculty.&nbsp; However, even if she does care for their well being, she still isn't
above enjoying self gratification, as shown by her keeping a portable heater in
her office all to herself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Overall, I hope that I was able to entertain you with my
third fanfic (or at least give you something to pass the time on a rainy
day).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
