Daria and all related characters are the property of MTV (generic fanfic
disclaimers and pleas for mercy apply). Lynn Cullen and AP McIntyre are the
property of the Canadibrit (ditto on the above). If you think I've done
something conducive to the advancement of a cure for insomnia&#8230; well you can
write me and vent a bit.<br>
<br>
As always - a keg of the drinking stuff (and my thanks) goes out to the
Canadibrit, who gave me an interesting place to play. Also, a moment of silent
thanks to the memory of Professor Richard Blumenburg - a true Jedi Master in
the art of the cinema, without whom I'd have few clues about getting the job
done right. I still miss him.<br>
<br>
(NOTE: This story takes place during the events at the end of 'Sister,
Sister'.)<br>
<br>
<br>
All other things considered equal, Sandi Griffin was not having what she would
consider a good school year. <br>
<br>
Life at home was not what it could have been. Life at the Griffin household
currently resembled sweeps-month episodes of 'Picket Fences'. May sweeps-month
episodes of 'Picket Fences'. Her brother Sam had gone over to his girlfriend's
house one night with some friends, and she had some friends over. It was bad
enough that Sam was caught with his pants down - literally - but the girl's
parents had 'Nanny-Cam' installed in their house, and they were threatening to
go on 'Jenny Jones' unless Sam stayed far away from the girl. Naturally, he
wasn't taking it well, and the sounds of things being broken in his room soon
became just more background noise in the house&#8230;<br>
<br>
Her mother had made an attempt to return to the world of broadcast news, but
the pressures of trying to remain on top within a certain demographic had all
but assured that Linda Griffin wouldn't survive for long. Not that she wasn't
attractive, competent and camera-friendly - but she was fortysomething, with
the same deep-toned voice that Sandi had inherited (along with her temper and
devious nature). Sela Ward &amp; Rene Russo notwithstanding, the general
manager wasn't willing to let her take the time to build a solid following of
viewers. Not with the 'If it bleeds, it leads!' quasi-tabloid slant that many
TV stations were following, or with the 'Which of these reporters would you
most like to f***?' method of choosing female on-air talent -<br>
<br>
And certainly not with Linda finding out that her husband had been sleeping
with that tiny blond thing with the big chest that anchored the noon news.
There was no way that Linda could stay in the Lawndale media circus after THAT
came out, and even though her dad was paying through the nose to make up for
it, the tension in the house was tangible enough to land cargo planes on&#8230;
Nobody had even bothered to talk to her about what was going on, to try to help
her or her younger brothers work through the Scylla and Charybdis that was her
father's affair (to a woman with blond hair and DARK ROOTS, no less!) and her
mom's endless reciprocity revue&#8230; Oh, well - at least Chris was enjoying his new
Sega Dreamcast and Playstation 2, and driving the new Corvette helped her
forget for a while. A little while. While N'Sync was on.<br>
<br>
At least nothing had happened to Chris. Not yet, anyway. Her psychiatrist had
told her to stop thinking that way, because the world wasn't out to harm
everything she cared about, but she looked the guy directly in the eye and
calmly replied, &quot;Don't worry, Doctor. I have faith in the world.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her grades were slipping. She was never a spectacular student, but she managed
to keep a college-worthy GPA - but now, with the home situation, it was hard to
concentrate and study. The teachers weren't any help at all - oh, they were
really feeling their oats, now that Ms. Li was gone. Bolstered by the new
student profiles provided by Mr. Harris (before he ran SCREECHING out the front
door of the school - wonder what that was all about?), some of Sandi's teachers
were putting the screws to her - except for Mr. DeMartino. He acted like he
didn't even care - and that began after she wrote that report on how events in
post-World War I Europe had led to the rise of the Nazi Party. <br>
<br>
In her report, she spoke on how the German people had elected Hitler chancellor
because of the promises he made to restore glory and honor to a Germany
decimated because of the Treaty of Versailles - and on how the Fashion Club
acted in the same way to give students something to be proud of outside of the
traditional school activities and despite the current administration, which had
sold the average student out to a plethora of outside interests. Unlike the
National Socialist, or 'Nazi' political faction, Sandi pointed out, the F.C.
was a force for good - because they also acted to abolish the stereotypical
labels given to students who participate in, who are pressured into, or who
suffer repercussions because of the mindset inherent within each of those
activities.&nbsp; Anyone and everyone who truly wished to better themselves was
welcome in the Fashion Club, and no one faction within LHS society was singled
out to serve as the focal point for the F.C. to use as a scapegoat for the
purpose of gathering or maintaining power. The Fashion Club, she argued, was a
proactive faction that recognized the inherent flaw within the social strata of
the high school - that appearance was the initial, and sometimes determining,
factor as to how a young person would be accepted within teen society. It
recognized this, and acted to help young people by ensuring that a teen could
have the time needed to be accepted on his or her own merits by assuring that
they fit on a base level within that society. Once that person was seen to have
some common factors as others, then they could also display those traits about
themselves that would prove them to be a benefit to the group as a whole.<br>
<br>
Two examples she gave in her report were of her friend Tiffany, who would have
been shunned by most of Lawndale High society were she not in the Club, and
Jodie Landon, who would be perfect for the Club. That way, people would just
let her be JODIE, not the stereotype 'perfect African-American student and role
model' that she felt she had to be. In the Club, Jodie would be able to relax,
to have fun and enjoy high school, to date someone she really liked and not
someone she felt she felt obligated to be with. Jodie felt that she had to stay
in her current position and activities in order to be a role model for other
Blacks, Sandi argued, but didn't realize that she could provide a better role
model for Black students by being one for ALL students - as a member of the
Fashion Club.<br>
<br>
Sandi heard him talking to Stacy about writing a comparison-&amp;-contrast
paper about the parallels between the Nazis and the Fashion Club, and was so
angry that she blew off a weekend trip of shopping in Dallas to write a report
of her own. She treasured the memory: the look on DeMartino's face when she
walked into the room, tossed the report at his feet and snarled, &quot;So we're
Nazis in the Fashion Club, right?&quot;&nbsp; She then turned to that snotty,
smarter-than-a-computer-and-just-as-attractive Daria Morgendorffer, fastened
her eyes to those shit-colored beads hidden behind those 'Never gonna get
kissed' glasses and said, in a voice that could take a house off its
foundation:<br>
<br>
&quot;Ever wonder why&#8230;? Ever bother asking?&quot;<br>
<br>
It was the first A she had ever received on a project in high school.<br>
<br>
From that day forward, Mr. DeMartino never pressured her on her work; he just
looked at her with an expression of sadness, as though he had failed at
something&#8230;<br>
<br>
Then, there was Quinn. Quinn Morgendorffer. Quinn, Quinn, Quinn, QUINN, QUINN! <br>
<br>
I guess it's true, she mused. The Lord protects little children, animals and
fools - He made sure that hussy got complete coverage, didn't He?<br>
<br>
Bitch. <br>
<br>
Vapid, rail-thin, airbrushed, strawberry-blond tease with a sweatband 'round
her head that reads 'Inflate to 45 psi'. Well, you know what they say: (1.) You
can sleep with a blond, you can sleep with a brunette, but you'll never get any
sleep with a redhead. (2.) What's the difference between a slut and a bitch? A
slut will sleep with anyone - a bitch will sleep with anyone but YOU. All
together, everyone - can you say 'I love ME?&quot; <br>
<br>
Bitch.<br>
<br>
That was the real pain - after all, nothing bad was ever going to happen to
that prize heifer in real life, especially since everyone always watched out
for her. She always got everything that she wanted, and it was so easy for her&#8230;
just stick her head, all covered in bouncy hair, in view of the public and
everyone would come running to help her, or do things for her, or give her
things&#8230;<br>
<br>
It just wasn't fair!<br>
<br>
And now, there wasn't really a Fashion Club. <br>
<br>
First Quinn took off for that Ted person, then Stacy ran off to join the
CHEERLEADERS (ugh) - I'm glad that she's gone, with her endless slip-ups about
the neutron-blond Barbie clone conservatives who dressed up like backup singers
for a bar band when they went on 'Politically Incorrect' to make fools of
themselves, and if I had had to listen to one more 'Do you think I'm more like
Jaime Somers, Juliet Parrish or Susan Ivanova?' -!<br>
<br>
After all, with her hair and eyes, she's more of a Jaime Somers - okay, if
you're talking about brains, she's a Juliet, but a bright red turtleneck shirt
and jeans straight off the rack? I mean, just how 'Hi, it's Saturday afternoon
at 3 in the park so I'll just throw ANYTHING on!' is that? And Ivanova? Let's
not talk about the fourth-string harem-girl outfit she wears off-duty, and that
hair, and who does your makeup - it's AWFUL! &nbsp;<br>
<br>
By the way, Susan&#8230; the way you and that Madison Avenue blond with the psychic
powers argue all the time doesn't fool anyone, and we know the two of you want
to compare shellfish recipes&#8230;<br>
<br>
Brushing her hair back in a manner that caused young male pulses to race, Sandi
turned to the spot where Stacy ate lunch with Jodie and Michel Jordan
Mackenzie. She watched as they chewed and slurped and laughed:<br>
<br>
I wonder what Jodie would say if she found out Stacy's had a crush on Mack ever
since third grade - I bet she'd love to read that 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'
take-off she wrote with her and Mack as Marion and Indy. Maybe I can get them
all together sometime for a little game of 'Truth Or Dare'&#8230; <br>
<br>
Daria.<br>
<br>
Sandi's hands gripped the book she held hard enough to leave indentations as
she thought once again of the auburn-haired girl who was related to Quinn. She
had never liked that girl, with her military-surplus glasses, and her
wannabe-Goth boots (get some Danners, already - you've shown you don't care
about your looks, so at least get something functional!) and her smirk. That
unholy smirk that made her look like the spawn of the Mona Lisa and Norman
Bates, the smirk that never quite went away, even if she was happy or annoyed
or sad, that smirk that seemed to say 'We both know that I'm better than you.
Accept it.'<br>
<br>
And that's why Sandi hated Daria Morgendorffer. She hated Daria because she
could be everything that Sandi had worked so hard her entire life to become.
Daria could do it - become a knockout with the guys, because she wasn't ugly or
really even plain&#8230; she simply didn't bother to try. Daria could be a fashion
plate, because she knew how to study up on the movements in fashion trends and
coordinate things, but she acted like that was beneath her. Daria could be
popular, or the school board's personal scholastic version of the T-1000, or
just an all-out 'Miss Most Likely To Succeed In Life', well-known and
well-liked by everyone in Lawndale - but she acted like none of that held any
bearing on life. Whenever she passed by Sandi, every time they made eye
contact, it was as if Daria was saying, &quot;Persons like you are a waste of
air, and I've wasted time out of my life by noticing you&#8230; time I'll never get
back. Please leave my field of vision.&quot;<br>
<br>
The main reason she hated Daria was because she KNEW Daria could do it. <br>
<br>
Sandi had always heard the teachers talk about Daria's 'potential', and it
grated at her. She knew what Daria could be, and she hated her for it. Many
things had passed through Sandi's mind as potential ideas to nail the mousy
little Smurf-bitch to a post, but the arrival of AP McIntyre and Lynn Cullen
put a horrifyingly swift end to THAT. That red-haired computer jerk was smart
enough - and sneaky enough - to do something really unpleasant, but Lynn, the
one who was a dead-on match for Daria&#8230; Sandi took one look in her eyes and
decided that she could lighten up - Armageddon didn't have to happen today&#8230;<br>
<br>
It just wasn't fair! Sandi raged inwardly. Why should those Morgendorffer
heifers get all the breaks? Quinn's got that nerd and he helps her out, and
Daria's got those two and her paint-freak jock queen loofah-buddy to back her
up - why can't I have friends like that? Why can't I ever have something like
that? Why don't I have a guardian angel on my shoulder to help ME out? WHEN DO
I GET MY SHOT?<br>
<br>
Sandi's scream - a scream of pure frustration, rage and despair, the scream
only a caged animal could make - echoed through the cafeteria.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's WRONG, Miss Griffin?&quot; <br>
<br>
Sandi looked up from her new seat on the cafeteria floor to see Mr. DeMartino
and a herd of students converge on her.<br>
<br>
&quot;A scream of that MAGNITUDE usually means that there's a problem, Miss
Griffin,&quot; he continued. &quot;Did you see a MOUSE, or were you just
DISPLAYING your OPINION of the cafeteria's daily EXCURSION into culinary
OBLIVION?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I thought I saw an ant on my plate,&quot; Sandi said, lifting herself up.
&quot;I - I have to go use the bathroom.&quot;<br>
<br>
As Sandi darted out of the area, Daria sipped at her milk from a vantage point
several tables away and watched her go. &quot;I wonder what that was all
about?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe she's lost the lock-on from her sanity beacon,&quot; AP quipped,
turning back to the table. &quot;After all, the Fashion Club is all but
extinct. They got their meteor strike and they're going the way of the
dinosaurs.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, yeah?&quot; Lynn cut in. &quot;Remember, the sharks didn't get THAT
memo, and they're still here. I don't trust her.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Paranoid, Lynn? Or just still pissed off about the Mercedes?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;All of the above,&quot; she growled, pulling a spicy chicken wing apart
in a fashion that made Daria, AP and Jane Lane wince. &quot;Besides, being
paranoid means that if you've dodged the bullet - well, there's still thirteen
more in the Para-Ordinance .45 that haven't been fired. Yet.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, she hasn't tried anything lately,&quot; Jane offered. &quot;And with
the defections in the ranks, Heinous Bitch Alpha really doesn't have the power
base to build another Death Star. Right now, her influence is limited to the
Core Systems.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's talk about something sensible and pleasant, with very little
sarcasm, violent content or evil teenage women fighting to the death -
ANIME!&quot; AP said. &quot;I got my latest order in today - 'Venus Wars',
'Demon City Sinjuku' - and the first two volumes of the 'Bolar Wars' episodes
of 'Star Blazers'. Who's coming over to watch?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm in,&quot; Jane spoke up, and Daria agreed; the twosome and AP turned
to Lynn, who slit open a chicken wing with an X-Acto knife - Where the hell did
THAT come from, the three wondered? - and removed the bones with an ease that
made Daria and Jane queasy.<br>
<br>
&quot;We can do that,&quot; Lynn spoke, and AP moved several inches away
because of the tone of her voice - a tone better suited for a member of the
Inquisition. &quot;We can watch over at my house.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What are you thinking about, Lynn?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Our friend Miss Griffin,&quot; Lynn hissed. &quot;She's a very lovely
person. Attractive, reasonably intelligent, intuitive, with a great sense of
humor, obviously a credit to her community&#8230; and it would be a real shame if
they never found the body.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lynn finished her spicy wings, blissfully uncaring of the fact that her three
friends chose that moment to give her a generous amount of arm and legroom at
the table.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello, Sandi.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sandi turned back to see the nondescript, well-dressed man who stood next to
the Tommy Sherman Memorial Tree, a warm, calming smile on his face. <br>
<br>
&quot;Who are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Someone who sees two Sandra Griffins,&quot; the man replied. &quot;One
growing bitter and vindictive with each passing day, who has given up on the
simple pleasures afforded her every day because she's so wrapped up in the
fortunes that fate has bestowed on others, and cursing the universe and herself
for not being worthy - or capable - of having those things for herself.&quot;<br>
<br>
The man idly brushed a leaf from his sleeve. &quot;Or so she believes. The
other one - well, I can't see her future. It may end with her in a palatial
manor, surrounded by her loving family as she peacefully passes away - or it
may end today.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sandi didn't move as the man started towards her. &quot;However it ends, though
- it will be a full, rewarding life regardless of what the calendar says. Which
shall you be, Sandra? Which road will you choose?&quot;<br>
<br>
The young woman looked the man over, and noticed something - unusual: even
though it was the noon lunch hour, with the sun high overhead - the man
standing before her cast no shadow. &quot;This is a dream, isn't it?&quot;<br>
<br>
A surprised, yet pleased smile appeared on the man's face. &quot;Correct.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But you&#8230; you're not part of my dream. I mean, you aren't a part of
anything I would dream up.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Continue&#8230;&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't want to,&quot; she yawned. &quot;I think you need to leave, so I
can get back to -&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;To living and dreaming in the shadows of others,&quot; the man finished.
&quot;To being in second place, no matter what the scoreboard or the sash says.
As long as you remain the person you are, you'll always be the runner-up. The
understudy. You're the back-up - just in case something happens. You've got
everything you need to win, Sandra. You've got looks, talent, intelligence -
you even have a soul, because you care about your brother - but it'll never be
enough to put you over the top, because you don't believe that you belong
there.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Get out of my head, so I can wake up, or something.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, I'm sorry - I must have forgotten that I'm here to help you,&quot;
the man responded. &quot;I've got a question for you, Sandra. Which is more
important to you - the way you feel, or the way others feel about you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Sandi remained silent. &quot;Excellent,&quot; the man said. &quot;You can think
before you speak or act. Now - listen closely. Your life literally depends upon
it.&quot;<br>
<br>
The feel of a hot, dry wind jerked Sandi's head up, and she suddenly found
herself upon a lonely, deserted road in the middle of a desert! &quot;Sandra,
listen to me closely, &quot; the man said, walking up to her from behind.
&quot;You can stay where you are. If you do, you will continue as you are now.
You'll care more for what others think about you than you care for yourself -
and that will lead you on a path straight to destruction. Does it really matter
whether you end up pregnant with triplets, or you end up doing three to five
years for drug possession and conspiracy, or you slit your throat on a broken
window in your college dorm room? None of it has to happen&#8230; if you're strong
enough to break the circle.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You have a choice,&quot; the man said, holding up an ornate, antique
hourglass. &quot;Do you really care about others say about you? Can you become
strong enough to know that the only opinion that matters is your own?&quot;<br>
<br>
Sandi looked at her clothing, now streaked and discolored from the dust and
blowing wind.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, no,&quot; she murmured, &quot;I'm a mess, and these clothes are -
&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn your clothes!&quot; the man snapped. &quot;I'm talking about your
soul! THIS is why you hate the Morgendorffer girl so much - because she's worth
something! You, however, are so shallow that you think your outer trappings are
what really matter!&quot;<br>
<br>
Grabbing Sandi by her shoulders, he spun her around to face a huge, full-length
mirror that appeared from nowhere! &quot;This is yourself ten years from
now!&quot; he growled, showing her the image of a strikingly beautiful woman
with waist-long hair and a near-perfect figure. &quot;Yes, you're beautiful,
and sexually appealing, but with all the depth of a dry lake bed!&quot;<br>
<br>
Sandi had barely time to admire herself when she was spun around to see another
image of herself - this one at least ten years older. &quot;Say hello to Sandra
Griffin at forty-two!&quot; the man snarled, and Sandi gasped as she saw
herself - still attractive, but with obvious signs of aging - and obvious
breast implants. &quot;We really do have a need to try and keep what nature's
given us up and running through the miracles of modern science, don't we? Oh,
look at your left hand - isn't that where a wedding band is worn?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, and so what?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Do you see one there?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No - &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And this, of course, comes as a big surprise to all of our guests out in
the studio audience! You're so in love with what you think people think you're
supposed to be that there's not a real Sandra Griffin for someone to discover
and love! Remember that!&quot;<br>
<br>
Sandi felt herself being spun about once again - and she found herself
face-to-face with the man! &quot;Would you like to see how the world sees you
at sixty? Better yet&#8230; why don't we take a look at how you'll see yourself at
that age&#8230;&quot;<br>
<br>
A scream of frustration erupted from the young woman. <br>
<br>
&quot;I see that I've made my point. You are a petulant, unrepentant and
nearly-irredeemable waste deposit of a person. You are a liar, a charlatan, and
a turncoat, incapable of any true and lasting relationships, and singularly
undeserving of the attentions of anyone of worth - let alone the attentions of
a good man. You are the worst in all that can be called woman, and negative
karma swirls about you like a fog bank about the girders of the Golden Gate
Bridge.&quot;<br>
<br>
The man paused for a long moment, allowing the woman before him to wallow in
his verbal cascade of truth and emotional wrath. &quot;And that is the
challenge that we will face together. I will see you through the fire, Sandra.
I will teach you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sandi's face, etched with shame, rose only slightly. &quot;Teach me
what&#8230;?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I will help you remove that which is negative within yourself. Together,
we will be rid of your petty vices and your emotional blocks,&quot; the man
told her. &quot;We will remove the darkness within your spirit, and allow the
purity of your true self to flow forth.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And what's in it for you?<br>
<br>
The man held up the hourglass he had earlier, placed it in a set of old-world
scales - the ones usually seen being held by the blinded figure of Justice, and
watched as it balanced the icon. &quot;Balance,&quot; he replied. &quot;That is
my reward. Now, it is time. &quot;<br>
<br>
He held out his hand. &quot;You can walk away now, Sandra. No repercussions, no
regrets, and this will be just as it is now - a dream. You can walk away - or
you can take my hand. Either way - it must be your choice. Of your own free
will, Sandra. You can have what I offer, but it must be of your own free will.
Make your decision.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What if I choose to stay where I am?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The world will continue to turn,&quot; the man said. &quot;Flowers will
grow, children will play, and water will still run downhill. Things will
continue as they will, and I'm sure that you will find some young man to hold
you close in the dark of night and tell you that he loves you, because that's
what he actually believes. You'll fight to keep those people with different
skin tones and eye shapes out of your little community's stores and homes, and
you'll spend desperate, stolen moments alone with someone, bathed in sweat and
self-loathing as you debase yourself in futile attempts to find meaning in
those endless minutes, and hours, and decades of being what Society wants. But as
you look just beyond your vision, counting the grains falling in the hourglass
of your days and praying for the last to fall - you will always wonder,
Sandra&#8230;&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't want to hear any more&#8230;&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You'll always wonder what it was like to move against the flow,&quot; the
man spoke. &quot;You'll see those people with purpose in their eyes, and wonder
how they managed to turn a deaf ear against the people like yourself. You'll
see them as they strive against hopeless odds, standing up for causes that have
no hope of succeeding, and doing so without a second's thought, or remorse, or
regret. You will see many of them fall, and many more of them broken beneath
the wheels of a world designed to crush them into powder and turn them into
examples - and still, so many more will rise to take their places. You will
always wonder what it would be like to fight for a cause; to protect those who
hate and fear and wish nothing but ill upon you, and yet doing so anyway.
&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Be quiet,&quot; Sandi said, her own voice barely above a whisper. <br>
<br>
&quot;And as you sit in palatial comfort and splendor, you'll wonder what it's
like in their world,&quot; he said, his voice soft against her spirit.
&quot;You'll sit back, a crystal of the finest wines this world can offer at
your fingertips, sipping as you look out the window and wonder&#8230;&quot;<br>
<br>
The man gazed into her eyes. &quot;&#8230;What it was like to raise your hand for
another - and for no other reason, than because it was Right!&quot;<br>
<br>
Sandi looked down at the outstretched hand. &quot;Make your decision,&quot; the
man said, his voice holding finality within. &quot;It is time.&quot;<br>
<br>
And as Sandra Elaine Griffin reached out to take the hand of the man in her
own, she felt an unexpected sensation; she felt a sudden lightness within, as
though a large weight had just been lifted away, and her next breath was sweet
and wonderful, as though she were breathing air untouched by anything but
nature&#8230;<br>
<br>
So this is what it feels like, she said, and a glorious, gentle smile - a smile
she could have never have brought forth before - touched her lips and spread
across her face as she felt herself awash in a sensation that seemed to enfold
her, all soft and gossamer and warm. This is what it feels like; to be&#8230; To be&#8230; <br>
<br>
&quot;It's more than that, Sandra,&quot; the man said, holding her hand until
the last, a smile on his face as she rose beyond his reach, ascending slowly.
&quot;Remember&#8230;&quot;<br>
<br>
I do remember, Sandi thought, as she saw her hand slowly disappear into the
warmth, a warmth that flowed into a brilliant light that wrapped around her and
drew her into itself.&nbsp; I do remember. This&#8230; this is what Love feels like&#8230;
this is what it feels like to be loved simply because I'm me&#8230;<br>
<br>
And Sandi Griffin was no more.<br>
<br>
<br>

AUTHOR'S NOTES:<br>
<br>
<br>
This one was really an example of a story that went into directions that I did
not expect in any way possible. I had intended to use this as a springboard
towards using Sandi as a superweapon against TFJM, having been trained to
handle them - and by the way, eventually leading Daria to the point where 'the
man' wants her. At a certain point, however, I realized that, with the world
that I have Sandi in, that if she ever had the chance, she'd never allow
herself to be used as a weapon. Even moreso, I thought that 'the man' was going
to become her mentor, teaching her that she could just be herself and good
enough as that - and that if she (Sandi) was comfortable with herself, then she
wouldn't have many of the problems she faces. Anyway, one thing led to another,
and I came to a simple conclusion - that Sandi had to die at the end. I don't
see this as bad, however, because she is at peace with herself, and surrounded
by love - the two things she didn't have at the beginning of the piece. This
one definitely goes into the 'experiment' file. &nbsp;<br>
