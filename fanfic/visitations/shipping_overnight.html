always, thanks go out to the folks at MTV who were (a.) intelligent enough to
create a show based around Our Heroine, (b.) brave enough to actually put it on
the air, and (c.) resilient enough to keep it there. Also, set up a big, frosty
one of Guinness for the Canadibrit, whose 'Look-Alike Series' has been the
genesis and primary influence on this series of fanfiction works (as well as
keeping me from looking like a fool by informing me of plot holes the size of
Bajoran wormholes).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

time, a very special acknowledgement goes out to two fanfic writers of
extraordinary talent. Thanks go out to Invisigoth Gypsy - the Queen Mother of
the Shippers - whose works brought me into the world of fanfiction (and whose
'The Disney World Story' is required reading if you're into 'Daria' fanfics).
Also, a 'thank you' to another equally-talented 'Shipper - Diane Long, who I
admit had a very strong influence on how the tone of this fanfic morphed from
its original incarnation. Thank you, ladies - and those headaches you've had
lately were simply my channeling you as I wrote.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a silent moment of thanks: to the memory of Professor Richard Blumenburg, the
best writing instructor I ever had. He said that he didn't want me writing

is Kurt Loder with an MTV Newsbreak,&quot; the image on the television rattled
off with a Peter Jennings-wannabe quality. &quot;Members of the recording
industry have had sharply divided opinions over the issue of downloadable MP3
music files - opinions that have, no doubt, influenced by the recent court
decision against the 'MP3.Com' web service.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

'em right,' Jesse Moreno mused, draining the last dregs of his Killian's Red
beer from its cinnamon-hued bottle and reaching for another. Jesse only drank
his beer from bottles, and was a hard-core purist on the subject. Two years
ago, when he found out that Killian's Red was being marketed in cans while the
Spiral did the bar scene after a gig in Oakwood, Jesse went off on a tearing,
obscenity-laden rant in that got him barred from every single drinking
establishment in the city.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On some
issues, Jesse was a purist. Bottled beer was one - and music was another.
&quot;Listening to someone's tunes is one thing, man, but copying the discs and
putting them online like that -!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

up, man,&quot; Trent Lane said, pulling himself up once again in the worn,
fake-leather recliner that sat in the middle of the room. &quot;They're getting
theirs the right way. The law's taking their cash.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

slammed his beer in several surprisingly quiet chugs, and Trent tossed a
handful of chips at him. &quot;You won't be driving off tonight.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I
know,&quot; Jesse droned, dropping his hand off into the Styrofoam cooler for
another bottle. &quot;Lynn said what she'd do if she heard I was driving - but
she took my keys anyway. She's better than okay, y'know?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Yeah
- I know,&quot; Trent soberly agreed, biting down on a pretzel stick.
&quot;When she came on, I knew we'd be moving to the next level. She makes us
better - she makes me glad that I'm into music.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The
slender young man stretched, and covered his mouth as the near-constant coughs
escaped from him. Got to get that checked, he said to himself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Yeah
- I can see that,&quot; the muscular guitarist agreed, and a bit of a boyish
smirk escaped across his face. &quot;Hey, Trent. Just wondering -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Trent
sobered up in an instant. He had learned LONG AGO that any time Jesse started a
conversation with those words, he was getting dragged into talking about
something that he SERIOUSLY didn't want to talk about. &quot;Lynn's really
cool, and she's smart - the way she was set up with that 'Buck Rodgers' space
chick outfit, she's world-class smoky - and she's hanging with the band even
though she could roll with anybody-&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

you want Lynn to set you up with that Mara chick, that's a done deal,&quot; Trent
said, unconsciously letting out a nervous breath as he got up and went for more
chips. &quot;She wants that leather off you in the worst way.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;No,
I'm wondering why you and Lynn didn't hook up after New Year's in London,&quot;
Jesse replied, freezing Trent in his tracks. &quot;I'm also wondering why you
didn't want to tell me about it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Hey,
I know when somebody's gonna get some,&quot; the answer came after a
half-bottle of Killian's disappeared. &quot;I'm your best friend. I'm just
wondering, man.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Look,
it wasn't right,&quot; Trent spoke, remorseful as he crunched chips. &quot;I
was buzzed into next week and already pissed after I saw -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Daria
and that pale little Techno-weasel guy Lynn's into going up to the roof,&quot;
Jesse finished - and throwing a serious shock into Trent. &quot;What, and I
don't notice stuff because I'm not a bookworm like Daria? You've been into her
since she got here, and you've been kind of down ever since she started hanging
out with him...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>That
got Trent's attention. &quot;Lynn's into that little punk? That's who she's got
a thing for? I knew she wasn't- but him?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Yeah,
and he's hot for her. I knew that, first day I met him. You did, too - guys can
always tell when some other guy's into someone.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Jesse chewed slowly on a soft pretzel. &quot;Unless they're
really young, really old or somebody's gay, guys and chicks can't be just
friends - and he's been around Lynn far too long. It just doesn't work that way
- somebody starts getting feelings, and either people hook up or feelings get
hurt. You ever see that 'Star Trek' show about that blonde robot chick and how
the doctor's helping her learn how to date? He starts getting feelings, and she
smashes him when she tells him that nobody there's good enough for her - &quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Jesse's

he showed up, he just started hanging with her, Daria &amp; Jane without really
even trying to check out the female action around here,&quot; Jesse opinioned,
&quot;and he never talked about being with or being into anyone from his old
school. Every guy talks about some chick he'd like to score on... unless he's
already hooked on one. THE ONE. It just makes sense that he's into Lynn -
probably the reason he moved on Daria like he did.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

paced the floor without answering him. &quot;I just finished off some Jack when
somebody's knocking on the door - and it's Daria, asking if I'm okay. I felt like
God sent her, like he was saying, &quot;Forget the little punk... It's a new
country, a new year - a new start after I screwed up everything at that dance...
and that's when I noticed it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

soulful eyes, those eyes that some guy was going to become so lost in that he'd
never find his way home, or want to...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was so close that if he moved his head, his lips would brush against Daria's

his own, and he could all but taste that unique scent that, over the course of
months, came to mean 'Daria' to him: a blend of scents that reminded him of the

almost 18, and he could think of her in those terms - and he had always known
that she was beyond petty things like jealousy, or gossip, or comparing herself
to other women. He looked into those eyes now, though - at the sadness and
shame that now made up her face - and what he saw was the debris in her soul,
the splintering remains of her faith in him. He saw what was the childlike
belief in something or someone that could only be broken by the rituals of
becoming an adult, and which left some people forever less than what they could
have been - because those rituals stole more than the bliss of childish
ignorance, but also innocence, and wonder, and curiosity. He saw into what
Daria could have been in that moment, and Trent felt the light of his own soul

&quot;Tell me that you really believe that Daria could even compare with her in
bed. Please, try to sound honest - by the way, Lynn's got more than just a
touch of the Crown about her, wouldn't you say? Personally, I've always found
the sexual mores of the Kingdom to be truly profound, especially during the
Victorian era - leg coverings to alleviate sexual innuendo, and yet one-quarter
of the women in London were employed as prostitutes... &quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Oh, pardon me - just reminiscing,&quot; the man said. &quot;You knew that it
was Lynn you were with. That's beautiful. With vengeful malice in your mind and
lust in your heart, you led her to your bed and took her virginity.... Or did
you? Not that she didn't come willingly - the fire in that fair maiden's veins
would burn the hypocrisy out of the Grand Inquisitor himself - but you could
have said 'no'. You could have been a gentleman, but you wanted sex and
vengeance - and you even led yourself to believe you had made a mistake in
making love to the wrong woman.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the young master Andrew Phillip, and the Dame Cullen are all aware of what's
happened - albeit not to what level. They're young, and resilient, and strong,
Trent - but you've taken a piece of their innocence away, and they can never

wanted to commit genocide as I was writing this one. I was also working on my
&quot;Charmed&quot; episode and two other 'Daria' fanfics, as well as my film
script about the flying seal (long story) as well as playing handservant for my
elderly parents (can you say 'Hurling Day', boys and girls? I knew you could!)
and putting together my Workman's Comp case as well. How can being bitten by a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Anyway,
this was about to run my sanity into the sand dunes - and then, I thought to
myself, &quot;Listen to Canadibrit - she gave you good advice on not forcing
things.&quot; So that, and a few extra hours of sleep (I kid you not - my
average is five hours a day) helped me finish this one. I'll finish the next one
up with the help of some Captain Morgan... Memo to all those fanfic writers out
there - ask the lady for help. When you get it, let the 'Ivanova is God' speech
from 'Babylon 5' run in your head, and just substitute 'Canadibrit' for
'Ivanova'. It's motivational, and a good way not to get too full of yourselves
when you think your<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>'Daria' fanfic is
ready to show to the public... (yes, maybe I have seen a episode or two too many
- but c'mon: Lynn's Purple, Daria's Green - am I the only one who sees 'Babylon
5' parallels in TLAS? Does anyone NOT see Jodie and Mr. O'Neill in the
Nightwatch, and I've always seen Helen as a Psi Cop - really, to paraphrase
Wayne Newton from that 'Ally McBeal' episode: 'I can't look at Helen and NOT
think 'riding crop!')<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>One
of the things that I played up in this is one of the reasons why I believe
Daria's attracted to Trent - because he's a little dangerous. I tried to play
up that, but also even it out by putting in genuine remorse. I also decided to
bring in Jesse as the voice of the angels; it gave me a little room to play
with his personality as well (I mean, besides being muscular, a fan of leather
and musically inclined - what else is there to say about the man?) I wanted
there to be no mistake, though: that Trent did wrong (if he did it - after all,
consider the source of the dream - the ultimate bad guy - not to mention that I
don't want Canadibrit nuking my home for making Trent an absolute bastard.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Did
I go overboard with the Trent/Daria scene? I'm going with the standard that
they use in episodic drama (okay, soap operas): no nudity, no groping of
genitalia or buttocks, no overt use of fingers EXCEPT for sucking on (go
figure). Although, I do remember an episode of 'All My Children' where Eva La
Rue and Edward Callahan bend the rules with one inappropriate trip to second
base... Let's be candid here - these are young adults with mature bodies and
(somewhat) raging hormone flows that act like the storm surges off Hurricane
Camille. Clothes are going to be shed. Sex is going to be had. If you can't
accept that... wait until you turn fifteen, or resign from the Republican Party,
or until someone frees you from the Collective and gives you a skintight suit
with five-inch heels. At the very least, kids - safe sex is not a joke... not
anymore. Don't be a statistic. Protect yourself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>On
the other side of the spectrum, comments came up about whether Trent could have
known that AP's always had a thing for Lynn. Two things: (1.) We see in 'Fire!'
that Trent has a 'gift' for detecting emotional shifts between individuals.
(2.) As any guy'll tell you - if a guy's not sleeping with someone, he's <u>planning</u>
on sleeping with someone, and it's probably that girl he always hangs out with.
AP's basically a normal guy, and really - he didn't even TRY to meet any new
girls (when a new animal hits the ground, one of the first things it does is
look for females as potential mates). As one guy I knew told a female
acquaintance: &quot;Look, I wasn't trying to have a relationship - I was just
looking for sex. Don't make any more of it than that.&quot; Let's face it...
we're men. Given the chance - we're dogs. (WHO LET THE DOGS OUT? WOOF! WOOF!
WOOF, WOOF, WOOF!)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
