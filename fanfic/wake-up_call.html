<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>This is a warning. Prepare
yourself for some outrageous and slightly graphic situations, but don’t get
frightened before the end, trust me it’s worth the wait. =) Enjoy. D/T, some
Q/Tom, and who the hell is that?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><u>Wake-Up Call</u></b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>A Daria Fan-fiction</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>By Sadie Knight</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She
woke to the shrill ringing of the telephone, its sharp ring sending small
throbs ricocheting through her skull. Stirring restlessly beneath the covers,
the young woman prayed that whoever was calling might tumble from the face of
the planet for all eternity, allowing her a few more hours of sleep. She didn’t
remember much. She knew she was in bed with a hangover, the dull ache of an
impending migraine sitting just behind her dark eyes. She needed sleep but the
incessant ringing of the phone denied any hope of that occurring.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Groaning,
head pounding, she scoured the floor for her glasses, instead discovering
tattered clothes strewn haphazardly around the room. Mumbling curses under her
breath, she grabbed the phone and in a stiff voice stated, “Morgandorffer,
minion of the dark one, whom you have woken with your ignorance. Prepare for a
slow torturous death. By the way, which would you prefer, the loss of your head
or that of your skin?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She
heard a snicker on the other end. “Twisted, Daria. Just twisted. So, what’s put
you in such a snit?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Sarcastically
she responded, “Well, I don’t know, Jane… Maybe because I thought my friends
knew better than to call me before the sun has risen, especially if they plan
to see tomorrow.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Jane’s cheery
laugh grated on her nerves and Daria got the impression that her friend was
smirking on the other end. “That’s so harsh, D.” Her friend was plotting
something; she could hear it in the slight drawl of Jane’s voice, and she
waited for the punch line. “By the way, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sleeping
Beauty</i>, I should mention that the sun has risen…” Jane chuckled, “and set
again.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Daria rubbed her
aching temples, trying to sooth her quickly fraying nerves. “Jane, while I
appreciate your telling me that I slept through an entire day,” she groaned
tiredly,” I would really enjoy a few more hours of shut-eye.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Well, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>that</i> isn’t completely the reason why I
called…” Daria could almost see the wheels grinding in Jane’s head; imagine the
soft clicking of the gears coming together. Something important was going to be
said, though she couldn’t guess what. Brushing a stray strand of dark hair from
her face, she waited.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Well?” she
asked impatiently after a few seconds of silence. “What is it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Do you know
where Tom is?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Whatever Daria
had been expecting, she hadn’t expected this. She felt her face flush. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tom</i>. Tom, who she had stolen from Jane.
Tom, who she had been dating for almost a year, but never really understood.
Tom, the tall broad-shouldered man who had said only two nights before that he
loved her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>And deep down
inside, she knew. She knew she didn’t love him, couldn’t reciprocate his
feelings. She was fairly certain that their relationship was winding down, and
at its end. Even if <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>he</i> had yet to
realize it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>She sighed. “No,
Jane. I don’t know where Tom is.” They were supposed to have seen each other
that day, she realized, but she had slept through it. Frankly, she was
relieved. Perhaps it would make breaking it off with him easier if he were
angry with her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She suddenly realized
that it was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>his</i> “declaration” that
had driven her to the bottle the night before. She smiled to herself. “You
know, Jane, I’ve just realized that I could care less where he is at the
moment.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>There was a
stunned silence over the phone. “Jane?” she asked concerned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“When did this
realization come to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>head</i>?” Jane
questioned with a small hint of humor behind it making Daria wonder what Jane
found so humorous. She frowned to herself before answering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Only just now.
But God! It’s so obvious that we’re over. It just took me till now to see it!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>She heard soft
laughter and then “Well then…this <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>will</i>
make things so much easier.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Daria was
immediately suspicious. ‘<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>What would be
easier’</i> she wondered. While she knew she was over Tom, she didn’t like the
idea that Jane might be interested. She felt a pang of jealousy, but
immediately knocked herself on her head for being stupid. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>‘God! What is wrong with me’</i> she thought <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>‘if Jane wants Tom, who am I to get in the way.’</i> But she couldn’t
deny that the idea really didn’t sit well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Jane chuckled
knowing <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>exactly</i> what Daria was
thinking. “Daria? You still there compadre?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Embarrassed at
her thoughts, Daria quickly answered, “Yeah, yeah I’m here Jane. Ummm…what
exactly will be easier?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Okay, just
follow me for a second,” Jane spoke quickly. “You don’t know where Tom is and
you don’t care, right?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Yeah,” Daria
stated impatiently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Okay then. Do
you know where <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>I</i> am?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Daria sighed. ‘<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Here it comes,’</i> she thought. “Are you at
Tom’s?” She waited nervously but was startled by Jane’s maniacal laughter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Not even if he
were the last man on earth.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Curious now,
Daria couldn’t help but ask, “Then where are you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Why Daria, I’m
in your room, of course.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>The ache in her
head had suddenly deepened into a roar, and Daria grimaced. “Not funny, Jane. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>I’m</i> in my room and you are most
definitely <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> here.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“I’m really <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> kidding. Your white padded walls and
rumpled sheets will vouch for me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Slightly amused,
Daria decided to play along and asked, “Have you been sniffing paint again?
Walls can’t talk.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“If walls could
talk, D, then yours would. I really am in your room.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Jane’s response
irked her and she snapped, “I’m not kidding, Jane. Really, where are you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Daria heard a
frustrated sigh come from Jane and then, “I’m serious, Daria, I’m in your room.
You can ask you parents if you don’t believe me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>‘What the hell?’</i> Daria wondered before
asking, “Jane. Is there some big cosmic joke playing out right now that I don’t
know about, one where I’m the butt of it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Jane laughed.
“To be honest, no. But you do have a nice ass if I do say so myself.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Daria flushed.
“Really, Jane. I never really thought you swung that way. I guess it’s time we <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>came out</i> and showed the world what we’re
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>really</i> made of.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Jell-O?” Jane
asked jokingly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“No, but I’m
sure Upchuck would appreciate that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Imitating their
obnoxious womanizing schoolmate, Jane went “Rrrrrowwww….feisty.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Daria shivered.
“Wowwwww…I think I’m going to have nightmares now. Did someone just walk over
my grave?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Unfortunately
Daria, you’re not dead.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Depends on who
you talk to.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Jane chuckled
and coughed <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City> style. “Yeah,
good one Daria. But really, D, we’re getting off track. Let me try to clear the
cobwebs from your brain. Do you know where your sister Quinn is?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Daria hissed.
“Yeah, Jane, way to clear the cobwebs,” she said sarcastically. “Why the hell
would I care where that little conniving rat is?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Whoa. You’re
pissed.” On her end of the phone, Jane grinned. “Okay, let’s try this a
different way. Where are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>you,</i> Daria?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Daria clenched
her fists, tolerance at the end of its rope. “Jane,” she growled warningly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Hey, before you
get yourself up in arms and come looking for me, why don’t you put on your
glasses.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Why?” Daria
asked annoyed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Trust me oh
blind one.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Fine. One sec.”
Grudgingly, Daria gave in and started looking while Jane listened to Daria
shuffling and cussing through the phone line. “Shit! When did it get so messy
in here,” she growled. She knew that Jane was probably balling with laughter
listening to her have a mental breakdown, and it only aggravated her more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Jane chuckled.
“Hey, Daria?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Yeah,” Daria
snapped in annoyance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“When are you
going to realize that you’re not in <st1:State><st1:place>Kansas</st1:place></st1:State>
anymore…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“I don’t know. I
f I was of sound state and mind right now, I might be able to respond to that, but
at the moment, I feel completely out of my depths.” Out of the corner of her
eye, Daria thought she saw in the dim light, the blurry outline of her thick
framed glasses. “Hold on a sec. I think I found them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Snickering Jane
asked, “Who? Tom and Quinn?” And under her breath, ’<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>That’s not the only thing you’ll find.’</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Shut up, Jane.
I found my glasses.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>On her side,
Jane smiled. “Well my compadre, why don’t you put them on.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Daria crawled to
her glasses and reached out to grasp them and jumped out of her skin with a
small shriek when the bundle of cloth promptly rolled to the side with a soft
“mmm…Daria,” then filtered into soft snoring. Daria flushed crimson.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Ummm…Jane?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Yesssss…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Don’t freak,
but there’s someone in bed with me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“No shit
Sherlock.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“I’m not
kidding,” Daria said worriedly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Jane snickered.
“Oh I know. I most <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>definitely</i> know,
you little <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>minx</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Daria rubbed her
forehead, sure that thunder was no barreling through her brain. “Jane, this
isn’t something to joke about,” she slowly ground out through clenched teeth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Oh, I’m quite
serious at the moment. And Daria, I was serious when I said I stayed in your
room last night. I told your mother that you had to go back to school early
because of an emergency, and unfortunately that I was locked out of my house.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Sighing, she
asked, “Is any of that true, Jane?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Nope, but I
didn’t think she’d appreciate me telling her that my bed is currently occupied
by another party whom I couldn’t mention for all intensive purposes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“I’m in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>your</i> bed, aren’t I?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Actually, no.
I’d hate to burst your bubble,” Jane laughed, “well, maybe not, but someone is
in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>my</i> bed, and it’s definitely <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Well, are you
going to tell me who?” Daria asked angrily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>On her end, Jane
smirked. “What? Who’s in my bed, or who’s bed you’re in?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Both, damn it.”
Daria was getting really pissed now. “Jane, this is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>not</i> a funny situation. I <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>slept</i>
with someone last night.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Daria, relax.
Things aren’t <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>quite</i> as bad as you’re
making them out to be. Beside, I probably shouldn’t tell you who’s in my bed.
It’s kind of damaging for<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> all</i> parties
concerned.” Jane stopped to think. “Though it would make great dirt for
blackmail. Maybe I should take a picture?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Annoyed, Daria
snapped, “Yeah, why don’t you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Innocently, Jane
asked, “Oh, you don’t mind?” Daria could almost visualize Jane’s eyebrow
quirking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Stop skirting
the issue and tell me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“I don’t know,
D. You might be disappointed in one of the party if I tell you, though I’m not
sure which one.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Jane…” Daria
sneered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Actually, you
might not give a damn whose in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>my</i>
bed, that is to say, once the person whose bed you’re in wakes up. Hell,
especially if he decides to play with you a bit.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Shut up and
tell me. I’ve had it up to here…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Interrupting, Jane
chuckled and said in a lurid manner, “Oh yeah, you definitely had <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>it</i> up.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Jane!” Daria
screeched in embarrassment. “You…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Dropping the
phone with a soft thunk on the bed mattress, Daria was shocked into silence as
the person beside her shot up yelling, “NO! Officer, I swear… I didn’t know she
was…” the voice broke off as the ebony eyes of <st1:Street><st1:address>Trent
  Lane</st1:address></st1:Street> came to settle on Daria then trailed from her
face down to her rather bare breasts. His eyes widened. Realizing what he was
staring at; Daria grabbed the covers and tugged them protectively over herself,
her eyes wide in shock and her cheeks crimson. However, <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>’s
eyes continued down over the blankets and came to rest on his own bared skin as
the situation became clear in his head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Holy shit!” he
exclaimed, face also red.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Uh…yeah, my
thoughts exactly,” Daria muttered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“So….” he
stuttered, “we…” ad trailed off nervously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Embarrassed, she
looked away. “Ummm….yeah looks like it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>She grabbed the
phone off the bed and scooted farther down the bed and asked as calmly as
possible, “Jane, what the hell am I doing in bed with <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Jane smirked on
her end. “I don’t know Daria, what do <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>you</i>
think you’re doing in bed with him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Daria stared at <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>
stared at Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Her blush
deepened. “Ummm…<st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>, I’m sure
it’s not what it looks like…” However, he didn’t answer. “<st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>He eyed her
thoughtfully, unsure how an angel had managed to end up in his bed. She wasn’t
a knockout like Monique, his bitchy ex-girlfriend, but there was something
about her that made a man <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>want</i> to
look twice. She was classically beautiful: big dark eyes you could almost sink
into with pale skin, and long thick brown hair. There was a flush over her skin
which almost seemed to make it glow. He felt an uncomfortable tug within and an
unbearable tightening in his belly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>And he realized
he wanted her…bad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>It was hard for
him not to, considering she was in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>his</i>
bed <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> nude.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“<st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>?”
She looked at him worriedly. He was looking at her oddly, and Daria had a
terrible feeling their friendship might be over. A friendship she wasn’t ready
to let go of. “<st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>His eyebrow
suddenly lifted into a quirk and he practically purred out, “Hey, Daria.” She
felt her heart flutter and wondered what the hell he was thinking. He crawled
towards her like a wildcat ready to pounce, and she nervously clenched the
sheet closer to her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Ummm…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>A slow crooked
smile slid onto his face as pulled her closer to him. “Why don’t we make up for
what we don’t remember last night?” Shocked, the covers slipped from Daria’s
tight grasp and <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City> pulled them
away from her. Pulling her into his lap, he wrapped his arms around her and
nuzzled his face into the crook of her neck. Then slowly spread soft kisses
over her skin, enjoying the shudders running through her as his hands slid over
its softness. He nipped her ear then ran his tongue around it, sending her
pulse beating erratically. Gently <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>
sucked on the lobe, as Daria gasped out in pleasure. “Why don’t you hang up the
phone, Daria,” he spoke softly, as one hand caressed her thigh.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Um, Jane,
something’s come up,” she stuttered out. “I’ll…I’ll talk with you lat…later.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>On the other end
of the line, <st1:Street><st1:address>Jane Lane</st1:address></st1:Street>,
artist extroadinare smiled brilliantly as she heard the click of the phone.
“Yeah, I know <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>exactly</i> what has come
up.” Humming to herself, she wondered what Daria would think about the others
in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>her</i> bed. She smirked. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>‘Oh, yeah. I should go and get my camera,’</i>
she smiled evilly, rubbing her hands together, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>’Blackmail time.’</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Meanwhile, back in Jane’s room…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She
woke feeling his strong arms wrapped around her. Smiling softly to herself, she
shifted in his arms so that she could admire his strong, handsome face. His
dark brown hair was sexily mussed up, and she found her blue eyes wandering
down his toned chest and smirked… last night was a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>really</i> good night. She was even considering keeping him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Running her hand
down his firm chest, she felt her heartbeat quicken when he let out a sexy
growl before popping one eye to look at her. Wrapping a strand of her copper hair
around his finger, he pleasantly smirked and leaned forward to brush a soft
kiss across her mouth. She sighed softly, and he hardened at the feel of a hand
on his &lt;cough,cough *wink*&gt; beneath the sheets. “Hey Quinn,” he drawled
out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>She smiled
languidly, “Tom.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“I like the
feeling of your hands on me, baby. Why don’t you let me do the same.” He
smirked as he felt her hand sliding up and down on his &lt;cough,cough&gt;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>She smiled
coyly. “Yeah, why don’t you…” her voice trailed off as her eyes slowly widened
in horror. Behind him, a body stirred and another head of red hair lifted up so
that a matching set of pale blue eyes stared back at her. Questioningly, Tom
turned to look, face paling white in shock, the hand around his
&lt;cough,cough&gt; slid sensuously back and forth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Well, hello
there…” the red head grinned, “last night was…was wonderful.” A lick of the
bottom lip and the red-head spoke again. “Why don’t we go another round?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Quinn screamed,
flying naked in all her glory off the bed, pulling the sheets with her. Tom
shifted slowly away, forcing the hand to release his &lt;cough,cough&gt;, and
moved behind Quinn, who backed into him nervously. He grimaced embarrassed at
what must have transgressed the previous night, and spoke one word with
finality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>“Upchuck.”</p>

I’d appreciate reviews and stuff as long as it’s constructive. I think I’ll
eventually post this on my site. **shrugs** Well, once I get the site up.
**sigh** I’m such a disorganized person, you know. Well, you do now. </p>
