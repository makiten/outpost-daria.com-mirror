<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:16.0pt;
font-family:Verdana;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>Daria looked
down at the tight fitting uniform she now found herself in. '<span
class=SpellE>Damnit</span> where the hell have these warped <span class=SpellE>fanfic</span>
writers dropped me now?' she thought to herself as she recognized the emblem
pinned over her heart and let out a groan. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>&quot;<span
class=SpellE>WHAT's</span> the <span class=SpellE>PROblem</span> <span
class=SpellE>AMigaaa</span>?&quot; <span class=GramE>Came from behind her.</span>
She turned and took in what looked to be the bridge of the Starship Enterprise.
&quot;I am <span class=SpellE>gonna</span> shoot AP and Lynn for making me
watch that Star Trek marathon.&quot; She muttered as she slowly took in the
scene before her. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>Jane sat
sideways in the seat normally held by Capt. James T Kirk, looking very
comfortable. She lazily petted a <span class=SpellE>targ</span> with one hand
and had a satisfied smirk on her face. &quot;What you thought you'd be captain?
Apparently someone recognizes my leadership abilities, and wanted me in the
driver’s seat.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>&quot;<span
class=SpellE>Uhh</span> Jane, I'm sitting where the actual driving takes
place.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>&quot;Oh shut
up you, can't let me bask in the glow of accomplishment even a moment.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>&quot;Perhaps
they recognized your skills at overacting.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>&quot;Perhaps,
but then again that was the old Jane... the Jane from this reality. She was
weak and pathetic, two things I am not. Security, seize her.&quot; </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'><a
href="http://www30.brinkster.com/quadstar/Daria-Online/TVDB/DeWittClintonTed.htm">Ted</a>
and <a href="lhttp://www30.brinkster.com/quadstar/Daria-Online/TVDB/Robert.htm">Robert</a>,
dressed in very tight Starfleet uniforms, moved towards her. Daria took a
closer look at Jane and her outfit, noting the decidedly <span class=SpellE>slutty</span>
look to it and the scar running down the side of her bare mid-drift. &quot;OH
MY GOD THEY DROPPED ME IN THE MIDDLE OF MIRROR, MIRROR AGAIN. <span
class=GramE>NOOOOOOOO!&quot;</span></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>As she was
being dragged away she kept muttering to herself, &quot;Somebody already did
this <span class=SpellE>fic</span>, somebody already did this <span
class=SpellE>fic</span>, <span class=GramE>somebody</span> already did this <span
class=SpellE>fic</span>…&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>------------------------</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>Author's
Notes:</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>1. AP &amp;
Lynn are of course <span class=GramE>belong</span> to <span class=SpellE>Canadabrit</span>
and if there is someone out here who hasn't read <a
href="http://www.outpost-daria.com/fanfic_series_tlas.html">The Look-alike Series</a>
then you definitely should. Both of her characters, Lynn and AP were
established to be <span class=SpellE>trekkies</span> somewhere round the middle
of the series.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>2. Also to
note that the 'already been done' <span class=SpellE>fic</span> was called
(duh!) <a href="http://www.thepaperpusher.com/mirror_mirror_intro.html"><span
class=GramE>Mirror, Mirror by <span class=SpellE>Paperpusher</span>.</span></a>  <a
href="http://www.outpost-daria.com/fanfic/through_a_closet_darkly.html">Through
a Closet Darkly by Brian Taylor</a> is another take on the ‘evil alternate
universe’  </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>3. Last but
not least, if you believe I own any rights to the Daria characters, then I have
a bridge and some nice swampland for sale.</span></p>
