<div>Rated: TV-PG for language<p><b>Short summary:</b><p>Daria and Tiffany
separately cope with jobs and parental expectations. Meanwhile the expanded
Fashion Club holds elections and Quinn and Sandi have to adapt to the new
members or lose their offices.<p>Chronology: This story marks the fifth episode
in my version of Daria's senior year, falling between <i>Is It Fall Yet?</i> at
the end of the fourth season and the beginning of the fifth.  The individual
stories have a sequence, and events in one depend on the previous stories, but
each story stands alone and can be read individually.  The sequence
is:<p>Temple of Gloom - 1 - Daria and Jane explore a tomb under Lawndale High. 
Very loosely connected to the others, and my first Daria story. Contains some
foreshadowing of Stacy's rebellion.<p>Breaking Strain - 2 - Daria gets a job.
Stacy stands up to Sandi.  Jodie hangs out with Daria and Jane.  The first of
four stories focused on the members of the Fashion Club.<p>Strange Bedfellows -
3 - A school trip to a ski lodge results in farce, and a better understanding of
Sandi. A Romantic Comedy.<p>Love's Labours Undone - 4 - The school puts on a
play.  Quinn and Sandi compete, and discover that they really are friends. Daria
gets involved, despite her better judgment, but has problems in her
relationships with both Jane and Tom, who seem to be getting along with each
other.<p>Welcome to the Rat Race - 5 - This story.<p>Daria (and associated

			<p><b>Intro, with title 'Daria, in
"Welcome to the Rat Race"':</b><p><b>ACT I</b><p><b>Interior.  Ms. Li's
Office, Lawndale High School - Day.</b><p><b>Ms. Li sits behind her desk,
shuffling papers.  </b><p><i>Superimposed title: Two Months
Ago.</i><p><i>There is a knock on the door.  Ms. Li stops rearranging papers,
and looks up.</i><p><b>MS LI:</b> (with enthusiasm) Enter!<p><i>The door
opens, and Jodie enters, followed by Daria, who closes the door behind
her.</i><p><b>MS LI:</b> (cordial) Ms. Landon, Ms. Morgendorffer, please be
seated.<p><i>Ms. Li waves to a pair of chairs in front of her desk.  Daria and
Jodie sit.</i><p><b>MS LI:</b> (businesslike) Congratulations.  The two of you
have the highest overall grade averages in the senior class.  Because of this,
you have been selected to represent Lawndale High in an experimental internship
program the county schools are conducting with Middleton
College.<p><b>DARIA:</b> (annoyed) I don't recall volunteering for an
internship.<p><b>Interior. Morgendorffer Living Room - Evening.</b><p><b>Daria
and Stacy are studying, as Sandi pushes past Quinn at the door to confront
Stacy, while Tiffany remains standing in the doorway.</b><p><i>Superimposed
title: Two Months Ago.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> (faux polite) Gee Stacy, this is a
surprise.  I thought you were working on your English paper.  Instead, you're
socializing with Quinn's unpopular cousin.<p><i>Stacy rises from the couch,
dropping her book, and turns to face Sandi.  She begins to breathe rapidly. 
Daria remains seated, watching the drama unfold.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b>  (to
Daria, not polite, working herself up to a tantrum) And you, Quinn's cousin,
you're so unpopular you don't have any friends, so you need to steal mine and
turn them into brains!  First it was Quinn, now Stacy!  I suppose you'll be
taking Tiffany next?<p><i>Daria scowls, and leans forward as if she's about to
stand up.  But Stacy speaks first.</i><p><b>STACY:</b> (still breathing hard,
but now angry rather than panicked, she speaks quickly, her emotion almost
outpacing her ability to speak) Leave her out of this!  This isn't about
her!  She's tutoring me because I asked her to!  Because I need her to, or I'm
going to fail English!  Haven't you been listening to anything I've said all
week?<p><i>Startled, Sandi turns slightly, and switches her offensive to
Quinn.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> Well, whatever the reason, Quinn's still been lying
to us!  Undercutting my leadership!  As if she could be a better president than
me!<p><i>Quinn looks angry, like she's finally had enough of Sandi's paranoia,
and starts to speak, but Stacy's still going strong and overruns whatever she
might have said.  In the background, Daria smiles and sits
back.</i><p><b>STACY:</b>  (yelling) You?  It's always about you, isn't it? 
The rest of us don't really exist to you, do we?  We're just "Sandi's
followers"?  You don't care what we want!  Just what you think we should
want!<p><i>Sandi's face, turned towards Quinn, goes blank with shock, and she
turns back to face Stacy.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> (defensive and upset, real
emotion, not her usual facade) Stacy!  That's not true!  Everything I do for the
fashion club is for all of us!  To keep us number one!  How can you say I
don't care?<p><b>STACY:</b>  (still yelling) If you care, then why
doesn't my failing English matter?  What you care about is that you're number
one!  No matter what it does to the rest of us!<p><b>SANDI:</b> (choked voice)
No!  I... No!<p><b>STACY:</b> (no longer yelling, but still angry and speaking
sharply) Well, I've had enough!  I only stayed this long because of Quinn and
Tiffany!  You and I used to be friends, but I don't know you anymore!  I don't
like who you've turned into!  It's over!  I'm quitting the fashion club, and you
can just go to hell!  I never want to see you again, now get out of here and let
me finish my English paper!<p><b>Interior. Ski Lodge -
Evening.</b><p><b>Students are gathered on couches and chairs around a
fireplace.  The room is lit by the fire, and by scattered oil lanterns.  Sandi
and Tiffany are sitting together, talking.</b><p><i>Superimposed title: Six
Weeks Ago.</i><p><i>Jamie walks up.</i><p><b>JAMIE:</b> Excuse me,
Tiffany?<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Yes, Jamie?<p><b>JAMIE:</b> Hey, you remembered my
name!<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Of course I remembered your name; it's not that
confusing.  What do you want?<p><b>JAMIE:</b> Well, I was going to ask you if
Quinn... Never mind, uh, can I get you a diet cola?<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Thank
you, but why don't we go get something together, that way you won't have to
carry drinks back across the room in the dark.  (to Sandi)  Catch you later,
huh?<p><b>SANDI:</b> (smiling) Sure.<p><i>Tiffany rises, and walks off towards
the bar at the far end of the room with Jamie. </i><p><b>Interior. Cafeteria -
Day.</b><p><b>Sandi, Stacy, Tiffany and Quinn are eating lunch and talking.
</b><p><i> Superimposed title: Three Weeks Ago.</i><p><i>Tiffany reacts to
something Quinn just said with an outburst.</i><p><b>TIFFANY:</b> (irate) His
name is Jamie!  Not Jerome!  Not Jeremiah!  How can you be so dense?<p><i>Quinn
is taken aback by Tiffany's vehemence, and looks at her in
surprise.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> What does his name matter?  He's just the third
guy with a soda.  And why do you care so much, anyway?<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> (still
irate) 'cause he's my damn boyfriend, that's why!<p>
<b>Interior. Hospital Room
- Day.</b><p>
<b>Quinn is sitting up in bed, leaning on a large pillow, with her
ribs bandaged. Sandi stands beside the bed, with a concerned look on her
face.</b><p><i>Superimposed title: Last Week.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> Have you
seen Stacy or Tiffany today?  I was hoping they'd come to
visit.<p><b>SANDI:</b> They'll be over later.  I told them I wanted to talk to
you alone first.<p><i>Sandi pauses, looking thoughtful.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b>
What is it, Sandi?<p><b>SANDI:</b> Well.  I've been thinking.  How would you
feel about putting the club back together?<p><b>QUINN:</b> Fine by me, but
Stacy and Tiffany were the ones who quit.  They're the ones you need to
convince.<p><b>SANDI:</b> They said okay, on three conditions.<p><b>QUINN:</b>
Oh.  What conditions?<p><i>Sandi ticks off the three points on her
fingers.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> One, you have to agree; two, we need to admit
Brooke and any others who want to join; and three, we need to hold an election
for club officers after we admit the new members.<p><b>QUINN:</b> But we won't
be exclusive if we let just anyone in.  And what if people who don't know
anything about fashion want to join?<p><b>SANDI:</b> I think that's their
point.  Besides, those of us who've been doing this for years will have an
advantage.  We can give seminars on color coordination, or makeup, and show the
new members how to be fashionable.  If we prove we know our stuff, we can
probably get our old jobs back even with an election.<p><b>Establishing shot:
Exterior.  Lawndale High School - Day.</b><p><i>Superimposed title: The Present
(late November, Wednesday morning)</i><p><b>Interior.  Hallway -
Morning.</b><p><b>Sandi, Quinn, Stacy and Tiffany are standing in front of the
lockers talking, while Stacy sorts through a pile of Waif magazines in her
locker. There is a visible bulge under Quinn's tee, where her ribs are still
bandaged from the recent accident.  She moves stiffly, and with careful,
deliberate movements.  Other students are walking about in the background,
taking off coats and pulling books from their lockers.</b><p><b>STACY:</b> I
know that article is here somewhere. I just saw it last week.<p><b>QUINN:</b>
Don't sweat it, Stacy.  It'll turn up.<p><i>Tiffany makes a disgusted
face.</i><p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Eww, Quinn, sweat.<p><i>Quinn turns to Tiffany,
with an amused grin on her face.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> I thought you were done
with the dumb act.<p><i>Tiffany grins back.</i><p><b>TIFFANY:</b> I am, but
old habits are hard to break.  Besides, I really don't like sweat; it's
gross.<p><i>Sandi watches the three with a thoughtful expression.  Her gaze is
distant, as if her thoughts are elsewhere, but a brief smile crosses her face at
Tiffany's last statement, so she's obviously listening.</i><p><b>STACY:</b>
Here it is, "How to explain fashion basics to the unfashionable".  It's part of
their "Beginners Guide to Fashion" issue.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Perfect, that's just
what we need. Right, Sandi?<p><i>Sandi returns from wherever her thoughts had
taken her, and focuses on Quinn.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> Right.  We'll need to set
up several training sessions, so we can all show how much we know to the new
members.<p><i>Stacy frowns.</i><p><b>STACY:</b> I thought the reason for this
was to teach the new members fashion, not to show off how smart we
are.<p><b>QUINN:</b> It is, Stacy, but we're also showing them that we're
qualified for our offices because we understand fashion better than they do. 
There's nothing wrong with doing both, is there?<p><b>STACY:</b> I suppose not.
But being club Secretary has more to do with taking notes and organizing the
meetings than it does with knowing fashion.  And I don't really think I want to
try teaching people anyway.  The first time someone asks me a question, I'll
panic, even if I know the answer.<p><b>SANDI:</b> It won't be that bad, and one
of us can sit in with you and help.<p><b>STACY:</b> No... I really don't think
I want to do it.<p><i>Quinn glances at Sandi, then turns to
Stacy.</i><p><b>QUINN: </b>You don't have to if you don't want to, the rest of
us can run the sessions.<p><i>Stacy hands the issue of Waif to Sandi, who tucks
it under her arm.</i><p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Well, actually, it'll be just you and
Sandi doing them.  I have to go to work right after school, remember? I'm not
going to be running for office anyway.<p><i>The other three react with
surprise.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> Not running? Why not?  You've always enjoyed
being Coordinating Officer.<p><b>STACY:</b> Yeah, and you do the best on the
mix-and-match tests of any of us.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Right.  Don't you want to
keep your office?<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Now that I'm working evenings for the
Christmas season, I don't have any time to put into coordinating outfits for all
of us, especially with so many new members to keep track of.  I'm not sure we
even need a Coordinating Officer any more.<p><b>QUINN:</b> But Tiffany, all the
new members are going to need extra help picking out outfits, at least at first.
Most of them haven't shown much fashion sense in the past.  That kind of advice
is what we need a Coordinating Officer for, even if you don't do a three-day
forecast for all of us like you used to.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> I don't think you're
giving the new people enough credit.  Most of them understand the basics, they
just haven't spent as much time on fashion as we have, so they aren't as good at
the details.  Remember back before the club broke up, when Brooke and Lisa beat
us to the new styles at the sale?  They knew what to get.<p><b>SANDI:</b>
Knowing that something is good, and knowing that it's good on you, or how to
accessorize for it, isn't the same thing.  The salespeople can help anyone pick
out good styles, but expertise is in knowing what's right for you.<p><i>Tiffany
quirks an eyebrow at Sandi, who looks embarrassed.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> Um, I
didn't mean you, I meant the other salespeople.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Well, anyway,
if we're going to have a Coordinating Officer, it's going to be someone other
than me.  I just don't have the time for it.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Very well, I'm
sure we can find someone who knows fashion well enough to do the work (she looks
at Quinn).<p><i>Stacy begins to glance nervously between Sandi and
Quinn.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> (looking back, sharply) Right, we can make it part
of the Vice President's job, then you can do it after I become President,
Sandi.<p><i>Stacy shows signs of impending panic: a strained expression, quick
glances between Quinn and Sandi, and short, shallow
breaths.</i><p><b>STACY:</b> (emotional) Guys, you're doing it again.  Do you
have to fight all of the time?<p><b>QUINN and SANDI:</b> Yes!<p><i>Stacy
flinches slightly, but stands her ground.  She appears calmer now, though still
not relaxed.</i><p><b>STACY:</b> Why?<p><b>QUINN:</b> Because we don't like
losing...<p><b>SANDI:</b> ...and we enjoy the arguments...<p><b>QUINN:</b>
...as well as the competition...<p><b>BOTH:</b> ...especially when SHE
loses!<p><i>The two of them dissolve into laughter, as Stacy and Tiffany look
on bemusedly. Stacy seems to have recovered from her
nervousness.</i><p><b>STACY:</b> I just don't understand how you can be friends
and still fight all the time.<p><i>Sandi chokes back her laughter to
reply.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> But we are, Stacy.  It's just how our friendship
works.  Quinn and I figured that out when we did the play.  You'll just have to
get used to it, we're not going to change.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Yeah.  It's not like
we're yelling or anything, and we're only doing it to each other, not to you or
Tiffany.  Don't stress over it, huh?<p><b>STACY:</b> Well, I'll try, but it
still seems weird.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Yeah, I'm with Stacy.  That's not a normal
friendship.<p><b>SANDI:</b> I won't argue with that, but it's the friendship
we've got, and we like it.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Yeah.  So, anyway, it sounds like
it's just Sandi and I doing the orientation sessions, maybe we should get one of
the new people to do one, so it's not just us.<p><i>The class bell rings, and
the other students drift off or into classrooms.  The four girls continue
talking as if they hadn't heard the bell.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> Good idea.  Lisa
has a good sense of style, we could ask her to talk about assembling
outfits.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> That's good. She'd like that.<p><b>QUINN:</b> We're
going to have elections for three offices: President, Vice President, and
Secretary.  Do we need a Treasurer too?  With all these new members, it's going
to be a lot more work to keep track of the budget.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Well, I
don't think Ms. Li is going to release any school money to us this year.  I'm
pretty sure she gave our money to Ms. Barch for the Science Club's field trip
after I dissolved the Fashion Club. And she was really annoyed with me too; she
was looking forward to income from our fashion show.  We were lucky to get
permission to hold the meetings during study-hall period, and that only happened
because the cheerleaders were already busy after school and wanted to join the
club too. She isn't going to do any more for us.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> We'll have
to collect dues if we want to have any money, and we'll need to be careful how
we spend it.<p><b>QUINN:</b> We've got lots of people who want to be members,
so we shouldn't need that much per person.  But somebody will need to keep track
of it.  I think we should add a Treasurer.<p><b>STACY:</b> Yeah, I sure don't
want to get stuck doing that.  Buying snacks for the meetings is complicated
enough.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Okay, we'll add Treasurer to the list.  That also gives
us one position someone new can take, without needing to know fashion.  It'll
help stop it from looking like we're trying to keep control of the
club.<p><b>STACY:</b> Even if you are.<p><i>Quinn turns to Stacy, with an
exasperated expression.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> (briskly) Well, someone who knows
what they're doing needs to be in charge, and that's one of the four of us.  If
you two don't want the job, it's got to be Sandi or me.  You can't have people
who aren't experts on fashion making decisions that affect everyone in the
club.<p><b>STACY:</b> (subdued) I understand, but I hope this doesn't mean
we're going back to the old fashion club (she looks pointedly at
Sandi).<p><b>SANDI:</b> (defensive)  No, we're not.  I promise.  When I am
elected President, I'm going to pay attention to what everyone else wants.  You
don't need to worry about that.<p><b>QUINN:</b> (smug) Besides, I'll be
President anyway.<p><i>Sandi looks like she's about to respond.  Stacy closes
her locker, loudly.</i><p><b>STACY:</b> Okay, that's it.  You two stay here and
fight if you want, I'm going to class.  Even listening to Mr. O'Neill is better
than watching you two try to outdo each other.<p><i>Stacy walks away, and the
other three trail after her, with Quinn and Sandi hanging back, talking to each
other. The camera remains in position, and we hear them talking as they walk
away.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> (to Sandi) I'll talk to Lisa about doing a session on
outfits.  Do you have time to update the list of offices and duties and make
copies before study hall?<p><b>SANDI:</b> Sure.  Chuck showed me how to use the
word processor in the computer lab, so I just have to make the changes and I can
print out a dozen copies right there.  That should be enough. There aren't that
many fashionable girls in the school.<p><b>Establishing shot:  Halcyon Hills
Corporate Office Park - Morning.</b><p><b>Halcyon Hills is a complex of
concrete and glass office buildings, of several stories each, set in carefully
manicured landscapes and surrounded by parking lots full of cars.  The sun
glares brightly off the glass of the buildings.</b><p><b>Interior. 
Hallway.</b><p><b>A featureless office hallway, lined with closed doors.  Next
to each door is a plate bearing the number ("407", etc) with last names on the
plates below the number.</b><p><i>Daria appears around a corner.  She's wearing
jeans and a faded orange t-shirt, and her usual boots, but not her jacket.  A
white badge bearing her picture hangs around her neck on a chain.  She's
carrying a sheet of paper in her left hand. Daria proceeds down the hallway,
until she comes to an open door to room 415, with no name on the plate. 
</i><p><b>The camera pans to look over her shoulder into the office as Daria
knocks on the doorframe.</b><p><i>The office is a small, windowless room,
holding four tables being used as desks, with little room to move between them. 
Computers sit on each of the four tables. One dark-haired woman sits with her
back to the door, working at a computer.  She doesn't react to the knock,
apparently deeply intent on her work.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Excuse me. Did you
call technical support about a network problem?<p><i>The woman stops typing,
and turns to face the door.  She is an Asian woman in her mid/late thirties,
wearing a conservative skirt and blouse. A matching jacket lies in a heap on a
nearby chair.</i><p><b>WOMAN:</b> (apologetic, but cheerful) I'm sorry; I
didn't hear you there.  That was fast; I only called an hour ago.  Come on in.
Welcome to my closet.<p><i>Daria walks in, looking around the
office.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> They really pack you in here, don't they?  I'm
Daria, by the way.<p><i>The woman speaks quickly, not pausing before changing
topics, as if the words are trying to get out faster than she can talk. She
projects an air of cheerful intensity.</i><p><b>WOMAN:</b> Pleased to meet you,
Daria, I'm Laurel.  They don't waste office space on a temp.  At least I have a
door.  I've worked places where they put a desk in the hall and told me to share
it with someone else.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Nice. I guess this is upscale by
comparison. (she leans back against a desk, looking around) So, what's the
problem, the report only says (reading from the paper in her hand) "network
broken".  They don't even have your name or phone extension listed, probably
because you're new. Can you be more specific?<p><b>LAUREL:</b> Well, I can't
print, which is what I really need to do, but I also can't get to the company
website, or my email, either, so I think it's safe to say the whole thing's
busted.<p><i>She ends with a faint shrug, and a quick grin, as if apologizing
for the computers misbehavior.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Fair enough.  Did it ever
work?<p><b>LAUREL:</b> I don't think so, but today's my first day. The computer
was already set up when I got here.  It's possible somebody was using
it.<p><i>Daria walks over, and looks at the computer, pulling a cable up from
behind it, and following the cable to a receptacle on the
wall.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Well, it looks like a good cable, and it's plugged
into the right jack on the wall.  That's always a good sign.  Can I look at your
computer?<p><b>LAUREL:</b> Let me save this first. (types briefly) Okay, it's
all yours.<p><i>Laurel rolls her chair away from the desk, and Daria pulls a
chair over from one of the other desks, and sits down at the keyboard.  She
opens windows and types for a couple of minutes.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Everything
looks fine, but it's definitely not working.  I'll go down to the wiring closet,
and make sure everything's connected properly there.  I'll be back in a few
minutes.<p><b>LAUREL:</b> Okay, great.  I'll get back to work. Let me know if
you need to use the computer again.<p><i>Daria stands up, and walks out of the
room.  Laurel rolls back into position, and begins typing.</i><p><b>Fade out
and back in.</b><p><i>Daria walks back into the room.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b>
Okay, try it now.<p><i>Laurel types briefly, and then turns around with a
smile.  Meanwhile, Daria has sat down on the edge of one of the unoccupied
desks, and is scribbling some notes on the piece of paper she's been carrying
around.</i><p><b>LAUREL:</b> Yes!  You fixed it, I can print! Now I won't have
to keep flipping between windows to check the source material. I hate small
screens. What was wrong with it? How did you fix it so quickly?  Was it
something I did wrong?<p><i>Daria shrugs, looking vaguely
embarrassed.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Whoever set up your computer forgot to call
us; this room wasn't wired at all.  I made all of the jacks in here live, so
when your fellow prisoners move in, they should be all set.<p><b>LAUREL:</b>
Thanks.  It's nice to meet someone who cares enough about her job to think ahead
like that.  It usually takes me several days at a company before they figure out
how to get whatever computer they dug up for me to socialize with the nearest
printer.  Don't take this the wrong way, but you look a little young.  Are you
an intern?<p><i>Daria stands, and puts her right hand on her
hip.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> (affecting a haughty attitude) I'll have you know I'm
a fully qualified Technical Support Assistant.  (she relaxes, and continues in a
normal voice) Which means, yeah, I'm an intern, and I've read a book about
networks, and spent one day a week playing with them for the last two months. 
That's hardly a lot of experience.  You were just lucky this time, and it was an
obvious problem.<p><b>LAUREL:</b> Well, maybe, but you seem to know your stuff.
Say, do you know if the cafeteria's open yet? I need caffeine.  And do you know
how late it closes?  I tend to work late, and having coffee is important. I lose
focus when I run out of energy, and just stare at the screen...<p><i>Daria
gives up waiting for her to run down, and just speaks over her to answer the
question.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> They're open from eleven to two for food, but the
coffee is self-serve and free all day.  My office-mates drink it by the gallon,
well into the evening. It's pretty bad even fresh, and they say it's high-grade
paint remover by late evening, although I'm not here that late, so they could be
exaggerating.<p><b>LAUREL:</b> Sounds like my kind of fuel.  Writing is hard
work, and I need all the kick I can get.<p><i>Daria sits back down on the desk,
looking at Laurel with interest.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> What kind of writing do
you do?  I thought this company sold software.<p><b>LAUREL:</b> Why don't you
walk to the cafeteria with me, and we can talk while I get some coffee.  By the
time I get back, my printing should have finished.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Okay, I
don't have any urgent problems to deal with.<p><i>Laurel and Daria get up and
walk out of the office.  The camera pans to reveal a photograph taped to the
wall, where it was blocked from view by Laurels computer screen.  The photograph
shows Laurel standing next to Tiffany.  The camera holds on a close-up of the
photograph briefly.</i><p><b>Cut to: Daria and Laurel walking up a bare
concrete stairway with metal railings. It's a typical interior fire escape
stairwell.</b><p><b>LAUREL:</b> Anyway, to answer your question, I'm a tech
writer.  Right now I'm working on the user manual for the next release of their
software.  The company brings temps like me in a month or two before they're
ready to ship, long after they should have started thinking about a new manual,
and we write like crazy.  The hours are insane, but I get paid by the hour, so I
don't mind.  I'm saving to put my daughter through college; extra hours are
always welcome.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Well, you must have plenty of time to save; you
look to be just over thirty.  How old is your daughter?<p><b>LAUREL:</b> Bless
you! But I'm thirty-nine, and she's seventeen.  I married young, and wasn't much
older when we divorced.  It hasn't been easy, putting enough aside for her
schooling, but I've done it.  By next year, she'll be able to go to a good
school.  Not a great one, her grades aren't good enough for one of those anyway,
but something better than the community college I went to. <p><b>DARIA:</b> So,
what is technical writing like?  I'm a writer, but just of essays and
fiction.<p><i>Laurel pauses before replying, as the exit through a fire door
into a hallway, and begin walking towards the cafeteria at the end of the
hall.</i><p><b>LAUREL:</b> Well, I'm not sure I'd recommend it as a career
choice.  There aren't that many permanent positions available, and as a temp you
have to compete with all the people who can't find work in their usual
profession, and turn to technical writing because they think it's easy.  Some of
them are just incompetent, but the people who do the hiring often can't tell the
difference between a good writer and a bad one until it's too late.  The actual
writing is fascinating.  I love learning a whole new subject each time. Usually
I have to drag information out of the technical staff, because nobody ever
writes the details down.  Discovering what I'm documenting is as much fun as
figuring out how to write it down so someone who's new to the subject can get
what they need out of the manual.<p><b>DARIA:</b> It sounds like you really
enjoy what you're doing.  That's the kind of job I'd want, and writing is
something I'm good at.<p><i>Laurel glances at Daria, with a skeptical
look.</i><p><b>LAUREL:</b> But you know computers.  You can make a lot more
money doing that.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Well, I don't really know that much, and I'm
not sure that I want to learn more.  It's a pretty sterile field, and the only
human interaction seems to consist of people yelling at me because I didn't
solve their problem fast enough.  I'd rather have a job where I did something I
enjoy.  Money doesn't matter that much.<p><b>LAUREL:</b> Oh? What line of work
are your parents in?<p><i>They enter a self-serve cafeteria, empty except for a
counter bearing a coffee maker, and a couple of canned soda vending machines.  A
larger area to the rear is closed off with a security grating.  Laurel heads for
the coffee, and pours herself a large cup.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> My parents? 
Mom's a lawyer, and Dad's a consultant, mostly because he can't deal with
authority, so he's never been able to keep a real job for any length of
time.<p><b>LAUREL:</b> But both of those are fairly high-paying jobs, aren't
they?<p><b>DARIA:</b> I suppose, although I'm not sure Dad manages to hold on
to his clients long enough to make much off them.<p><b>LAUREL:</b> But my point
is that you're used to a standard of living based on those jobs.  Adapting to
something less is harder than you'd think.  When my husband left me and I had to
work, without much of a marketable skill, it took ages to become comfortable
living on a tight budget.  Don't underestimate the adjustment you'll have to
make if you're on an income where you have to scrimp to afford cable TV, or a
new computer when the old one dies.<p><b>DARIA:</b> I hadn't thought of it like
that.  I guess I do take some things for granted.<p><b>LAUREL:</b> That's
hardly surprising, if you're still a student.  You don't really think about
money problems until you have to deal with them.<p><i>Laurel leans back against
the counter, sipping her drink.  Daria stands nearby,
thinking.</i><p><b>LAUREL:</b> Anyway, I don't mean to frighten you away from
writing as a career.  If you're good, and a bit lucky, there are real writing
jobs out there, and if you've got the right personality, and the economy is
doing well, temping is great.  But you're probably better off using writing as
an adjunct to something else, rather than as an end in itself.  That way you
have something else to fall back on, and a writer who is also an expert in the
subject is more valuable than a writer who's learning as she
goes.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Yeah.  Thanks.  You've given me something to think
about.<p><b>LAUREL:</b> No problem, I enjoy talking, when I have time.  Drop by
my palatial office some day at lunchtime and we can go eat together and talk
some more.  I'll be around for the next month or so. Maybe longer, if they have
another job after this one.<p><i>Laurel refills her now-empty coffee cup. She
takes another sip, and makes a disgusted face.</i><p><b>LAUREL:</b> Your
friends were right, this is paint remover.  If it were any stronger, it would
eat through the cup. (smiles)  I love it.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Just don't blame me
when you get an ulcer.  I warned you.<p><b>LAUREL:</b> I'll be sure to tell my
lawyer to go easy on you.<p><b>Interior. Classroom - Day.</b><p><b>The room is
a typical Lawndale High classroom.  Quinn, Stacy and Tiffany sit behind the
teacher's desk.  Sandi is standing beside the desk, speaking. About a dozen
girls, and a couple of boys, sit facing them.  Among the students are Brooke,
several of the cheerleaders, and a small cluster of girls with decidedly
unfashionable clothing, multiple piercings, and tattoos.</b><p><b>SANDI:</b>
So, those are the bylaws, any questions?<p><i>She waits, but nobody speaks. In
fact, nobody even moves.  If they weren't all looking at her, they would appear
to be asleep.  Apparently, it's been a long, dull, meeting.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b>
Okay.  Next on the agenda: elections.  We have four offices: President, Vice
President, Secretary, and Treasurer.  The duties of the Coordinating Officer
have been merged into the Vice Presidents office. Anyone who wants to run for
office, sign up by Friday's meeting with our Secretary, Stacy.  After that,
you'll have to be a write-in candidate.  Questions?<p><i>Robby, one of the
pierced girls, dressed all in black, who looks like a younger version of Andrea,
with light brown hair, stands up to speak.  A few of the other audience members
watch the resulting conversation with interest.</i><p><b>ROBBY:</b>
(challenging) Yeah, I got one. What's to keep you from stuffing the ballot box
and re-electing all your friends?<p><i>Sandi appears irked at the question, or
perhaps just at the argumentative tone in which it was asked, but replies
calmly.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> Elections will be by paper ballot during our
regular meeting, in one week, and we'll have someone from the student council
here to supervise the election.  Anyone who wants to can check the ballot box
before we start, and the ballots will be counted in the meeting.  This is a real
election.  We're not trying to fool anyone.<p><b>ROBBY:</b> And what're you
going to do if you lose, quit and form another club?<p><i>Sandi is clearly
holding herself back from a sharper reply, but continues to speak
calmly.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> No, as long as the club continues to be about real
fashion, we're going to be a part of it.  Now, if there aren't any further
questions, we'll move on to the next agenda item.<p><i>She pauses briefly, and
continues without really leaving time for any other questions.  Robby seems
about to speak, but sits down instead.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> Next up is Quinn, to
explain our fashion orientation sessions.  Quinn?<p><i>Sandi sits down, as
Quinn steps up beside the desk.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> Since some of you are new
to the world of fashion (she looks at Robby and her friends) we've organized a
few sessions to explain the basics: outfits, color coordination, and
accessorizing. I'll explain how to accessorize tomorrow, then Friday, Lisa will
explain how to pick an outfit, and Monday, Sandi will talk about color
coordination.  We'll be meeting in this room, after school.  I hope you'll all
be able to attend.<p><i>Quinn sits down, and Sandi steps back
up.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> That's the end of the agenda.  Does anyone want to
raise any issues for the meeting?  (she looks around, but nobody responds) 
Okay, that's it then.  Our next meeting is during study hall on Friday, in this
room.<p><i>The meeting members stand up, and begin walking out the door.  A few
come up to talk to the four at the front of the room.  Robby and her friends
leave with the others.</i><p><b>Interior. Technical Support
Room.</b><p><b>There are several desks around the edge of the room, and a large
pile of cardboard boxes in the middle.  Computers sit on three of the desks, and
what appears to be a disassembled computer sits on another desk.  A couple of
desks are piled with tools, wires, and paper.</b><p><i>Daria is sitting with
her feet up on a desk, reading, as her coworkers, Ben and Jerry enter. Ben is
about thirty, tall, and overweight, Jerry is about 25, thin, with a narrow face,
and about as short as Daria.  Both are wearing jeans and t-shirts bearing
illegible corporate logos.  Both are carrying paper coffee cups with steam
rising from them.</i><p><b>BEN:</b> Careful.  Work much harder and you'll have
a heart attack before you're thirty.<p><i>Daria looks up from her book, amused,
and closes the book, holding her place with a finger.  Her conversation, and
that of the other two, is entirely in a serious tone, although it's clear that
none of them take it seriously.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Well, I could run around
like a headless chicken, but then I'd need to take a management position, oh
fearless leader.<p><i>Jerry chalks a mark on an imaginary scoreboard in the
air.</i><p><b>JERRY:</b> Workers, one; Management, zero.<p><i>Ben turns to
Jerry with mock severity.</i><p><b>BEN:</b> Don't you have something useful to
do?<p><b>JERRY:</b> Yeah, but I decided to come to work anyway.  Why, do you
need something to do?  I think there's a union rule against that
somewhere.<p><b>BEN:</b> We're not unionized.  If we were unionized they'd have
to pay us overtime, and then we could retire young.<p><b>DARIA:</b> So instead,
you slave away for ten or twelve hours a day on a straight salary.  And I used
to think you were smart.<p><b>BEN:</b> Speaking of work, is there anything
happening out there today?<p><b>DARIA:</b> The usual crop of self-inflicted
injuries.  I handled most of it, but I left a couple of calls for you guys. I
didn't want to spoil your fun.<p><b>JERRY:</b> How can we ever thank
you?<p><b>BEN:</b> I don't know, but I think it involves surgical
instruments.<p><i>Ben walks over to a pile of paper, skims it, and hands
several pages to Jerry.</i><p><b>BEN:</b> Here, you take these, and I'll handle
the others.<p><b>JERRY:</b> Got it.<p><i>Jerry walks out, still carrying his
coffee in one hand.  Ben flips through his papers, while Daria looks on. 
Eventually he looks up at her.</i><p><b>BEN:</b> Come with me.  You can tell me
about the ones you fixed while I work on these.  And there's something I want to
talk to you about.<p><i>Daria sets her book down, places a bookmark that was on
the desk in it, swings her feet to the floor, and stands
up.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> What's up?<p><i>The two walk out into the hall,
walking side by side once they are through the door.  The camera keeps pace,
with a medium shot from in front of them, so we see their faces as they
talk.</i><p><b>BEN:</b> Your internship is over in a couple of weeks.  Looking
forward to returning to school full time?<p><b>DARIA:</b> I'm not sure "looking
forward" is exactly the right phrase.<p><b>BEN:</b> (chuckles) Okay, point
taken.  You've done some good work here.  I don't expect much from interns, and
that's usually what I get.  You've actually been useful on more than simply
clerical stuff.  That's rare.  I've already passed my comments along to your
principal, and you should be getting an excellent grade for the internship,
although I don't get to set the actual grade.<p><i>Daria is clearly embarrassed
by his comments, and mumbles something inaudible in reply.</i><p><b>BEN:</b>
You don't need to be embarrassed about doing a good job.  It's something to be
proud of.  Anyway, Jerry and I both appreciate the way you've been handling the
routine things before we get in.  It gives us that much more time to focus on
the serious problems.  I know you have to go back to school during the day, but
would you consider a part-time evening job?<p><i>Daria stops walking with a
stunned look on her face.  Ben stops and turns to face her.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b>
A job?<p><b>BEN:</b> Yeah.  Four or five hours a night, two or three nights a
week.  You know enough now to be useful on some of the routine maintenance we do
in the evenings, and there'll be days when we don't get through all of the
problem reports, and you could handle some of those too.  I can't promise you
great pay, but it beats flipping burgers, and I can pay at least as much as they
can.  I'd pay more, but HR controls the purse strings, and they're of the
opinion that all warm bodies without credentials are identical.<p><b>DARIA:</b>
I don't know.  I like working with you guys, but it is work, and I'm not sure I
can afford to lose two or three nights out of my week.<p><b>BEN:</b> Well,
think it over.  Let me know in a couple of weeks what you want to do.  Just
don't make a decision until you've given it some thought. 
Deal?<p><b>DARIA:</b> Yeah, okay, I'll think about it. But I don't think I'll
go for it.<p><b>BEN:</b> Just give it some thought, that's all I'm
asking.<p><b>Interior. Jake's Car - Night.</b><p><b>Jake is driving.  Jodie is
in the front seat, and Daria sits behind Jake.</b><p><b>JAKE:</b> How was your
day, Jodie?<p><b>JODIE:</b> Oh, the usual: file this, take notes on that.  I
could do it in my sleep.  I'll be glad when this internship is over; it's pretty
dull.  Daria has a much more interesting job, and she's really impressed her
boss.<p><i>Daria is looking at Jodie, shaking her head in negation, trying to
get her to shut up, but Jodi is looking forward, and doesn't see
her.</i><p><b>JAKE:</b> She did?  (over his shoulder, to Daria) That's great,
kiddo.  How'd you do that?<p><b>DARIA:</b> (quiet monotone) It's nothing,
Jodie's exaggerating.<p><b>JODIE:</b> Hey, being offered a part-time job isn't
nothing.  They wouldn't have done that if they didn't think you were something
special.<p><i>Daria gives up, and flops back in her seat.</i><p><b>JAKE:</b>
They offered you a job?  Jodie's right, you must have really impressed them. 
When do you start?<p><b>DARIA:</b> I'm not sure I want to start.  I've got
senior year to get through.<p><b>JAKE:</b> Oh.  Well, I suppose that does take
a lot of your time.  But a job would mean extra money for
college.<p><b>DARIA:</b> I thought you said we were all set for college,
between the money you and Mom set aside, and Grandma Barksdale, and some student
loans?<p><b>JAKE:</b> Well, yeah, but it's still going to be tight if you get
accepted by one of the more expensive schools.  Every dollar helps, even if it's
only a little extra for textbooks or spending money.<p><b>DARIA:</b>
Oh.<p><b>JAKE:</b> I'm not saying you should take the job if you don't want to,
just that it would be a good thing to do.  If you wanted to do it, that
is.<p><i>Daria scowls, unspeaking but plainly indicating that she doesn't want
the job. However, Jake can't see her since she's directly behind
him.</i><p><b>Interlude (a video montage with music):</b><p><i>Daria meets
Laurel.</i><p><i>Sandi presides over the Fashion Club meeting.</i><p><i>Robby

Break</b>
			<hr>
			<p><b>ACT II</b><p><b>Interior.  Morgendorffer Kitchen -
Breakfast.</b><p><i>Helen and Jake are seated at the breakfast table. Jake is
reading a newspaper, and Helen is picking at a grapefruit. Daria enters,
collects a bowl and cereal box from the kitchen cabinets, fills the bowl, and
takes the milk from the refrigerator. </i><p><b>DARIA:</b> (looking at milk
carton) Whole milk?  Who bought this?<p><b>HELEN:</b> Your father, who
else?<p><i>Jake looks up briefly from behind the paper.</i><p><b>JAKE:</b>
(whining) I don't like that other stuff; it tastes like water.<p><b>HELEN:</b>
But it's much healthier for you than whole milk, dear.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Yeah. 
Isn't one heart attack enough?<p><i>She pours some milk over her cereal, and
returns the carton to the refrigerator. Jake ducks back behind the
paper.</i><p><b>JAKE:</b> You're ganging up on me!<p><b>DARIA:</b> Well, what
do you expect?  We prefer you alive. If we wanted to kill you off, we'd leave
skateboards at the top of the stairs in the morning.<p><i>Helen glances at
Daria with a frown, not exactly approving of this approach.</i><p><b>HELEN:</b>
Honey, we care about you, that's why we want you to watch what you
eat.<p><i>Daria walks over to the table with her cereal, and sits
down.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Speak for yourself.  I just like picking on
him.<p><b>HELEN:</b> (mildly exasperated) Daria!  That's no way to talk about
your father!<p><i>Jake sets the paper down, and looks at
Daria.</i><p><b>JAKE:</b> So, have you told your mother about the job
offer?<p><b>HELEN:</b> Job offer?<p><i>Daria looks up at
Jake.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Touche. (turning to her mother) It's nothing, Mom,
the folks at my internship have an opening for an evening job, and offered it to
me, but I turned them down.<p><b>HELEN:</b>  Why?  You like working there, and
you can certainly use the money for college.<p><i>Jake retreats behind his
paper.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> I won't get to college if I don't finish senior
year, and I need my evenings for schoolwork.<p><b>HELEN:</b> You spend most of
your evenings reading and watching television.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Right, and if it
comes to a choice between that and schoolwork, I know which loses.  Besides, I
won't get to see Jane once we leave for college, so I want to spend time with
her while I still can.  I won't be able to do that if I'm working.<p><b>HELEN:
</b>Daria, I'm not going to force you to take the job if you don't want it, but
you really ought to give it more thought before you turn it down.  Aside from
the money, it's good experience, and it will look very good on your college
applications to continue it after the internship.<p><i>Daria finishes her
cereal, and carries the bowl to the sink.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> I'll think about
it, Mom, but I'm fairly sure of my decision.<p><i>She picks up her pack, and
walks out of the kitchen.  We can hear the front door open and
close.</i><p><b>HELEN:</b> (to Jake) So, when were you going to tell me about
this?<p><i>Jake puts down the paper.</i><p><b>JAKE:</b> She's old enough to
make her own decisions, Helen.  If she really doesn't want to do it, there's no
point in us pressuring her.<p><b>HELEN:</b> (defensive) I am not pressuring
her!  I said it was her choice, didn't I?<p><b>JAKE:</b> Yes, and so did I when
I pointed out the money aspect to her yesterday.  It's still pressure.  But I
was hoping she'd tell you on her own.  She does listen to you, even if it
doesn't seem that way.<p><b>HELEN:</b> I know.  I suppose I was just like her
as a teen; I'd never admit what I was thinking to my parents.  Somehow, I
thought it would be different with our girls.  We've avoided the mistakes our
parents made, but they still treat us as if we couldn't understand them if they
talked to us about their lives.<p><b>JAKE:</b> She did come to you when she had
that problem with Jane and Tom.  Would you have talked to your mother about
something like that?<p><b>HELEN:</b> God, no.  She'd just have used it as an
excuse to tell me to act more like Rita.<p><b>JAKE:</b> So, the two of you
already have a closer relationship than you and your mother.  Don't push. She's
going to have to start making her own decisions soon enough. It's best if she
gets used to it while we're still in a position to watch. She's heard both of
us, and she'll make the decision that's right for her.<p><i>Helen reaches over,
and takes his hand.</i><p><b>HELEN:</b> I hope so, Jake.  I really hope
so.<p><b>Interior. Classroom - Day.</b><p><b>Quinn is standing at the front of
the classroom.  Most of the students who were at the Fashion Club meeting are
present, except for Sandi, Stacy, and Tiffany.</b><p><b>QUINN:</b> So, an
accessory is anything that works with your outfit; a purse, a belt, or a pair of
earrings, for example.<p><b>ROBBY:</b> Why a pair of earrings?  Why not one, or
three?<p><i>A look of annoyance crosses Quinn's face.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b>
Because fashionable earrings come in pairs.<p><b>ROBBY:</b> Lots of people wear
them in other numbers.<p>
<i>Quinn's answer is abrupt.  Not angry, but she
speaks as if she were explaining the obvious to someone who ought to know better
than to ask.</i><p>
<b>QUINN:</b> That's a fad. Just because lots of people do
it, doesn't make it fashionable.<p>
<b>ROBBY:</b> So, a fad is something people
do because it's popular, and fashion is something popular people do?  What's the
difference?<p>
<i>Quinn adopts a calm, instructor's voice.</i><p>
<b>QUINN:</b>
Real fashion is based on principles like balance, and complementary colors. 
It's like art.  A fad is just something that catches on for a while because it's
different, and then disappears when people get used to it.<p>
<b>ROBBY:</b> But
the rules change.  Pants weren't fashionable for women a hundred years ago, now
they are, and bow ties used to be fashionable for men, and now they're just
silly.  How do you know which principles matter?<p>
<i>Various students nod as
Robby speaks.  It appears that she's asked a question many of them
share.</i><p>
<b>QUINN:</b> We know because experts like the Waif magazine
editors keep track of what's fashionable, and explain why, and then we can use
those explanations to guide what we choose.<p>
<b>ROBBY:</b> So, we should
follow rules set by people who figure out the rules by watching what people like
us do?<p>
<b>QUINN:</b> Right.<p>
<b>ROBBY:</b> But isn't that kind of circular
reasoning?  You can't prove something's true by assuming it's true to begin
with.<p>
<b>QUINN:</b> (emotional) This isn't math!  This is
art!<p>
<b>Interior.  Junior Five - Night.</b><p>
<i>Tiffany is working,
straightening clothing on racks.  Stacy enters, shopping, but doesn't see
Tiffany, although she can hear her working on the opposite side of the rack
she's examining.  Stacy pulls out a top, and looks at it, then she looks around
for someone to help her.</i><p>
<b>STACY:</b> (speaking over the top of the
clothing rack in front of her) Excuse me, do you work here?<p>
<i>Tiffany stands
up and looks back at Stacy.</i><p>
<b>STACY:</b> Eep!  Tiffany, I didn't realize
it was you.  Have you seen Theresa? There doesn't seem to be anybody in this
department.<p>
<b>TIFFANY:</b> Actually, I'm running the department tonight.
Theresa has the night off.  Did you want to try that on?<p><b>STACY:</b>
(excited) They're letting you run the department?  That's so cool! 
<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> (amused) Yes.  That's a nice top, but I saw one you might
like even better over on the sale rack.<p><i>Tiffany points to another rack of
clothes.  Stacy turns to look.</i><p><b>STACY:</b> But aren't those old
fashions?  I don't want to wear something that's gone out of
style.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> It's just stuff that hasn't sold in a while, maybe
because it wasn't stylish, or maybe because it just wasn't right for anyone.
There's a blue one that would probably look good on you. Take a look and see
what you think.<p><i>Stacy runs over, and begins sorting through the clothing. 
Tiffany finishes what she was doing, and walks over to join her.  Meanwhile,
Stacy has pulled out a blue top that looks exactly like the one she's wearing,
and is holding it up in front of her.</i><p><b>STACY:</b> This is great!  And
it's sixty percent off, wow!  Can I try it on too?<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Of course,
I'll unlock the dressing room for you.<p><i>They walk over to a corner where
there's a dressing room door, and Tiffany takes a key from her pocket and opens
the door.  Stacy walks in with the two tops she's found, and emerges a short
time later wearing the first one.</i><p><b>STACY:</b> What do you
think?<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> I like it. I didn't think it would work when you found
it, but it does.  You have a good eye.<p><b>STACY:</b> Thanks.  So, have any of
the others stopped by to visit you at work?<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Well, a few girls
from school have seen me, but you're the first of my friends to come by.  I only
started this week, you know.<p><i>Stacy walks back into the dressing room and
closes the door.</i><p><b>STACY:</b> (off screen) Why are you working here,
anyway? I was wondering, but I didn't want to ask in front of the
others.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Well, Theresa said they needed people for Christmas
season, and my Mom's been working really hard to save money so I can go to
college, so I thought I should earn some too.  Maybe she won't have to work so
much overtime if I can save enough.  Also, she's been bugging me because I spend
so much time on clothes and makeup. This should show her that I can make money
from it, so maybe she won't get on my case as much.<p><i>Stacy walks out, now
wearing the new blue top (we can tell by the tag on the sleeve), which is
otherwise indistinguishable from her usual blue top.</i><p><b>STACY:</b> How
does this look?<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> That's nice too, but if you were only getting
one, I'd go with the other one, it's something different, and this is closer to
what you usually wear.<p><b>STACY:</b> Yeah, I think you're right, but with
this one on sale, I can afford both.  If I was only going to get one, I'd get
the other one.  Was your mother happy?<p><i>Tiffany seems confused by the
question.</i><p><b>TIFFANY:</b> About what?<p><b>STACY:</b> About you getting
a job.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Oh.  I haven't had a chance to tell her yet. She's
been working really long hours this month.<p><b>STACY:</b> But didn't you need
her permission? You're not eighteen yet.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Well, I lied about
my age.  They wouldn't let me work alone unless I was eighteen, so I wouldn't
have been able to get as many hours.  Don't tell anyone.<p><b>STACY:</b> Jeeze,
you could get in big trouble.  What if she finds out and gets
upset?<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Nah, she's not like that.  She's trusted me to take
care of myself when she was working for years, she won't mind this.<p><i>Stacy
goes back into the dressing room.</i><p><b>STACY:</b> (off screen) Well, okay. 
My Mom would freak if I did something like that.<p><i>Stacy comes back out in
her usual attire (no tag) holding the two items.</i><p><b>STACY:</b>
(mischievous) Well, miss, I think I'll take these two items, can you wrap
them?<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> (grinning) Of course, Madam, will that be cash or
charge?<p><b>STACY:</b> (giggling) Put it on my Mom's store credit card, I
think you know her name.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> (still grinning) Of course,
Madam.<p><b>Interior. Pizza Place - Evening.</b><p><b>Jane and Daria are
sitting in a booth, with the remnants of a pizza between
them.</b><p>
<b>DARIA:</b> She's so predictable; I could replace her with a tape
recorder.  Job offer: "gee, Daria, that would look good on your college
applications."<p>
<b>JANE:</b> Your mother never said "gee" in her
life.<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> Probably true, but irrelevant.  What matters is her
knee-jerk reaction to any opportunity for my self-promotion.  Hasn't she figured
out yet that I'm not the self-promoting type?<p>
<b>JANE:</b> Yes.  That's why
she feels it necessary to push you.  She knows you won't push
yourself.<p>
<i>Daria cocks an eyebrow at Jane in a questioning
gesture.</i><p>
<b>DARIA:</b> Do you think I should be taking this job
too?<p>
<b>JANE:</b> You're not going to draw me into this.  I don't have an
opinion on the job.  Take it if you want to, or don't.  But don't ignore an
opportunity just to spite your parents.<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> No... That's not it. 
I'll admit the job is tempting, but I really don't have the time for it.  I want
to enjoy my last year of high school, not waste it in a corporate maze.  That
comes after college, not before.<p>
<b>JANE:</b> Listen to yourself: "enjoy"
high school? Do you remember where you go to school?<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> Oh God,
kill me now.  I did say that, didn't I?<p>
<b>JANE:</b> Yep.  And I would, but
I'm eating, and the blood would ruin my appetite.<p>
<i>Jane takes a slice of
pizza, and bites into it, chewing with gusto.</i><p>
<b>JANE:</b>  (somewhat
mumbled, around the food) Hmm.  Good pizza.<p>
<i>She swallows and, still
holding the pizza, looks at Daria.</i><p>
<b>JANE:</b> I don't know what your
problem is.  So your parents want you to think about the job.  They're not
forcing you to take it, are they?<p>
<i>Daria, her mouth full of pizza, shakes
her head: no.</i><p>
<b>JANE:</b> Hell, I'd be happy if my parents paid that
much attention to me.  Benign neglect is fine, up to a point, but it would be
nice if they cared what I did.  Be thankful yours do.<p>
<i>Jane goes back to
eating her pizza.  The two eat in silence for a while before Daria
replies.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Well, I am glad they care.  I just don't like the
way they tell me to think for myself, and then question every decision I
make.<p><b>JANE:</b> Maybe they only question the wrong ones.<p><b>DARIA:</b>
Thanks.  Your support is duly noted.<p><b>JANE:</b> Hey, it's what friends are
for, or so I'm told.<p><b>DARIA:</b> So, friend, do you think I should take the
job?<p><b>JANE: </b>As I said, I don't have an opinion.  But if you like the
work, and the pay is good, why wouldn't you take it?<p><b>DARIA:</b> Because I
don't have the time for it.<p><b>JANE:</b> Bull.  Ten or fifteen hours a week? 
You spend more than that reading my father's back issues of national geographic
while I paint.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Right, and I don't want to give up my social
life for work.<p><b>JANE:</b> You don't have a social life.<p><i>Daria appears
to have been stung by that comment.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> (defensive) What about
eating pizza with you, or movie night with you and Jodie?<p><b>JANE:</b> We can
still fit in movie night, and both our waistlines would benefit from less
pizza.<p><i>She picks up another slice and begins to eat.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b>
Right.  I can see how concerned you are about that.<p><b>JANE:</b> Look, if you
didn't want my opinion, why did you ask?<p><b>DARIA:</b> Because I wanted you
to tell me I was right.<p><b>JANE:</b> Are we back to that supportive thing
again?<p><b>DARIA:</b> Okay, okay, I give up.<p><b>JANE:</b> So, you're going
to take the job?<p><b>DARIA:</b> No, I'm going to stop asking you for advice.
(grins briefly)<p><b>JANE:</b> Works for me.<p><b>Interior. Junior
Five.</b><p><b>Tiffany is working in the clothing department, returning
clothing from the dressing room to the racks. Theresa can be seen in the
background, working at the counter.  A young girl walks up to her, as she speaks
we see her face: it's Robby, carrying a gray blouse on a
hanger.</b><p><b>ROBBY:</b> Excuse me; can I try this on?<p><i>Tiffany turns
to face her, and Robby gives a start of recognition.</i><p><b>TIFFANY:</b>
Sure.<p><i>Robby steps into the dressing room, while Tiffany returns to racking
clothing.  A short time later Robby emerges, wearing the blouse, and looks at
herself in the mirror.  Tiffany walks over to her.</i><p><b>TIFFANY:</b> That
looks good.  It complements your skin tone better than pure black.<p><i>Robby
seems surprised.</i><p><b>ROBBY:</b> How about the earrings?<p>
<i>Tiffany
looks in the mirror briefly.</i><p>
<b>TIFFANY:</b> Hmm.  You should really wear
gold.  Your skin's too pale for silver.<p>
<i>Robby turns to face
her.</i><p>
<b>ROBBY:</b> You don't think three earrings in one ear are
unfashionable?<p>
<b>TIFFANY:</b> It's not what I'd wear, but I'm more
traditional than you are.  Three is fine, if you're going for a less
conservative look.  What matters is that your accessories reinforce the look you
want.<p>
<b>ROBBY:</b> Uh, yeah.  But that's not what Quinn was saying the other
day.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Quinn's even more conventional than I am.  They look
fine on you.  They'd look silly on Quinn.<p><b>ROBBY:</b> (smiles briefly)
Yeah, they would. Thanks.  I'll take the blouse.  And then I'm going to go find
some gold earrings.<p><b>Interior. Classroom - Day.</b><p><b>This is the same
classroom as the previous Fashion Club meeting, and the original four members
are once again behind the desk, with Sandi standing and talking.  The same
students are seated at the desks as before.</b><p><b>SANDI:</b> So, we have
four candidates for President, two for Secretary, and three for Treasurer. 
Unfortunately, nobody (she looks pointedly at Quinn) is interested in running
for Vice President.<p><i>Stacy looks up from the notes she's
taking.</i><p><b>STACY: </b>Um, so do we extend the nomination
period?<p><b>SANDI:</b> No.  I talked it over with Jodie, and she suggested
that whoever got the second largest number of votes for President could be the
Vice President.  (she looks pointedly at Quinn, again).<p><b>QUINN:</b> And I'm
sure you'll make a good VP, Sandi.<p><b>ROBBY:</b> What about write-in
candidates?<p><b>SANDI:</b> Well, since nobody is running for Vice President,
it's not going to be on the ballot for a write-in, but you can still write in
for the other positions.  I'm surprised you're not running for office, you seem
to have a lot of ideas on how we should run things.<p><i>Robby looks around the
room, where more conventional students are clearly in the
majority.</i><p><b>ROBBY:</b> Yeah, well I don't claim to know enough about
fashion to run the club. I just have some ideas about how not to run
it.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Okay, but you could always run for Treasurer, or Secretary.
(Stacy glances up)  If you decide you want to be on the ballot, just let Stacy
know by the end of the meeting.<p><b>ROBBY:</b> No thanks. Politics isn't for
me.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Very well, next on the agenda, Tiffany has an announcement.
Tiffany?<p><i>Tiffany stands up to speak, and Sandi sits back down while she's
talking.</i><p><b>TIFFANY:</b> I just wanted to let everyone know that Cashmans is having a fashion show at the mall tomorrow to display their new winter line, and they need teen models. If anyone's interested, you can signup at the Junior Five counter tonight. Participants get a coupon good for ten percent off of one day's shopping. I'll be there, and I hope some of you will too. It's good experience if you're thinking about modeling, and ten percent off your Christmas shopping isn't too bad a deal either.<p><i>Tiffany sits back
down, and Sandi rises, but she holds off speaking as there's a buzz of
conversation in the room after Tiffany's announcement.  After a while, she bangs
on the desktop with her knuckles to get everyone's
attention.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> Okay everyone, if you're interested, go and sign
up.  In the meantime, we need to get back to our meeting.<p><b>Interior.  Mall
Food Court - Day.</b><p><b>Daria and Laurel are sitting at a table off to one
side of the food court, eating.  Laurel has a salad, and Daria a hamburger. 
Laurel is wearing the same outfit as when we first saw here, complete with
rumpled coat.</b><p><b>LAUREL:</b> Thanks for inviting me to lunch. It's good to get out of the building sometimes when the sun is out, even if it's just to go to a mall where you can't see it anyway. Oh, that smells so good. I hate my diet. How did you get them to cook it rare? Nobody does that anymore; they're all afraid of being sued. Aren't you worried about bacteria?<p><i>She finally
pauses to eat a bit of salad.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> You're welcome, and to answer
your questions in order: the chef's one of my sister's boyfriends, and I told
him I'd put in a good word for him if he cooked it my way, and no, I'm not
worried about bacteria.  I ate rare hamburgers for years without getting sick,
and statistically I'm no more at risk now than I was then, which is not
very.<p><b>LAUREL:</b> I do tend to talk on, don't I?  I guess I'm just used to
talking for two.  My daughter doesn't talk much.  That was nice of the chef. Are
you actually going to put in a good word for him with your
sister?<p><b>DARIA:</b> Probably not.  But it won't matter, she thinks all boys
are valued on the type of car they drive and their desirability to her peers. 
She doesn't actually care if they're thoughtful or not, as long as they appear
to be in front of her friends.<p><b>LAUREL:</b> That's horrible.  But my
daughter's the same way.  Her current flame is better than most of her boys, but
he's still fairly empty-headed.<p><b>DARIA:</b> How many seventeen-year-old
males have you met who weren't?<p><i>Laurel laughs, a quick, sharp, bark, while
Daria smiles briefly.</i><p><b>LAUREL:</b> True enough.  But there are some.  I
just don't want her to marry someone as shallow as her father.  You've heard of
men leaving their wives to marry their secretaries, right?<p><i>Daria
nods.</i><p><b>LAUREL: </b>Well, usually they wait until they have middle-age
as an excuse.  Mine left me after two years.  He was twenty-four.  His secretary
was younger than me, by about a year.<p><i>Daria, her mouth full of hamburger,
makes a commiserating noise.</i><p><b>LAUREL:</b> I console myself with the
thought that it's better that he left then, than taking off after I'd had a
chance to get used to him.  Except for the effort of raising Tiffany on my own,
I'm not sorry to see him go.<p><b>DARIA:</b> (surprised) Tiffany! She's your
daughter?<p><b>LAUREL:</b> Yes.  Didn't I mention her name before?  Do you know
her?<p><b>DARIA:</b> No, you didn't, and no, I don't really know her.  She's
one of my sister's friends.<p><i>Laurel pauses briefly for
thought.</i><p><b>LAUREL:</b> Oh!  You're that Daria.  Quinn's sister.  Funny,
from her description of you, I always pictured you as some kind of rebel in a
leather jacket or with a pierced nose or something.<p><b>DARIA:</b>
(incredulous) Quinn said I had a pierced nose?<p><b>LAUREL:</b> No.  She said
you didn't care about your appearance, and that you always had to be different
from everyone else.  But you don't really look any different from most
people.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Ah, but I don't wear makeup, obsess about how my
handbag clashes with my shoes, or change my dress three times a day.  I don't
even own a handbag, shoes, or a dress.  By the Fashion Club's standards, that
makes me a rebel, or possibly an alien.<p><b>LAUREL:</b> Yes, I think that
describes my relationship with my daughter, too.  One of us is an alien, but we
disagree on which one. She lives for boys and clothing, and I was a bit of a
nerd in high school, and haven't really changed. I'll never understand her
obsession with her appearance, and she'll never understand why I'm so concerned
about money and school.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Yeah, my Mom and I sometimes seem like
that.  She's a workaholic lawyer, and work is something I can't get excited
about.  That's why I wanted to talk to you.  The network group at the office
park has offered me a part-time job when my internship is over. I can't decide
if I should take it or not.  Mom and Dad think I should, but their reasons seem
to have more to do with money than anything else.<p><b>LAUREL:</b> Well, that
is why most of us work.  Welcome to the rat-race. (smiles)   Is the reason they
are concerned about money school, or about you being
self-sufficient?<p><b>DARIA:</b> Hmm.  I'd thought it was about school, but it
could be...  They have been leaving more decisions up to me lately.  Maybe
they're trying to get me ready to leave home for school in the fall.  I hadn't
thought of it that way.<p><b>LAUREL:</b> Well, put yourself in their shoes. 
Speaking as a mother, I worry about how my daughter will cope when I'm not
there. Her values seem so different from mine, and she doesn't appear to have
any direction in her life. I don't know how she'll react to unexpected
circumstances.  I'm afraid she won't be able to deal with problems. Your parents
may have the same fears.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Yeah, and if I know them, it's
compounded with guilt that they may not have spent enough time being parents.
Although, to be fair, I think they did a decent job of it, on the
whole.<p><b>LAUREL:</b> Yeah, I know that guilt, too.  I have so many jobs with
heavy overtime, I rarely see Tiffany after school, and we don't get in much talk
over breakfast.  Her obsession with her appearance started years ago, and now I
wonder if I had spent more time with her, could I have somehow changed that?  I
wish I could spend more time with her now, but I really need the hours at
work.<p><b>DARIA:</b> What about weekends?<p><b>LAUREL:</b> Well, she's
usually busy with her friends. I don't want to be the heavy, telling her she has
to spend time with me when she wants to do something else.<p><b>DARIA:</b> I
don't know.  It seems to me you should set aside time to be with her when you
can.  It's not like you'd be telling her she can't spend any time with her
friends. If you don't understand what she wants from life, if the two of you
keep thinking of each other as aliens, how are you ever going to be able to
trust her when she goes away to school?<p><b>LAUREL:</b> That's true. (stares
off into the distance with an abstracted look for a while) Yes, you're right, I
need to spend more time with her.  Now I just need to convince her of that.  So,
what about you?  What are you going to do about the job?<p><b>DARIA:</b> Well,
if this is my parents trying to get me to try my wings, they're probably going
to be upset if I say no, even if they claim it's my decision.  But I really
don't want to lose time I could spend with Jane.<p><b>LAUREL:</b> Well, just to
throw another monkey wrench into the gears, consider this: a job is a way to
meet people you wouldn't ordinarily meet.  If you want to write fiction, the
more different people you know, the more material you'll have.  Hanging out with
your friend is satisfying, but there are other kinds of
satisfaction.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Damn.  You make a convincing
argument.<p><b>LAUREL:</b> So, are you going to take the job?<p><b>DARIA:</b>
I need to think some more, but it's not as clear-cut as it was
before.<p><b>LAUREL:</b> (chuckles) Sorry, it's the mother thing, we can't help
making simple decisions complex.  Now that I've thoroughly derailed you, I
should be getting back to work.  Shouldn't you be in school now,
anyway?<p><b>DARIA:</b> Yep. I can ditch lunch with impunity, but I'm going to
catch hell for being late for economics.  That is, if the teacher has noticed
I'm missing.  She can be single-minded in her pursuit of scholasticism, to the
point where she forgets there is anyone else in the room.<p><b>LAUREL:</b> I'll
give you a ride.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Thanks. As long as you drop me by the woods
out back of the school, I can get in without anyone noticing.<p><i>The two
rise, and walk away.</i><p><b>Interior. Quinn's Room - Night.</b><p><b>Quinn
and Sandi are sitting cross-legged on the floor, looking at piles of Waif
magazines.</b><p><b>SANDI:</b> This Robby is really starting to get to me.  If
she doesn't want to be fashionable, why is she even in the damn
club?<p><b>QUINN:</b> I think she wants to be popular, without giving up her
idea of fashion.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Well, that's fine.  If she wants to dress like
someone in a vampire movie, that's her business.  What bugs me is her assuming
that we're some kind of control freaks, who want to rule the club at all
costs.<p><b>QUINN:</b> But Sandi, we are trying to rule the
club.<p><b>SANDI:</b> But we're not going to cheat to do it.  Damn her, I'm
going to win because I'm the best. (looks at Quinn) Or you are, whichever.  But
we don't need to cheat to beat out someone whose idea of color coordination
involves different shades of gray.<p><b>QUINN:</b> We don't need to beat her;
she isn't running for office anyway...<p><i>The phone rings, cutting off Quinn.
Quinn stands up to answer the phone.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> Hello,
Stacy?<p><b>Split screen: Medium shots of Quinn on the left and Laurel in her
kitchen on the right.</b><p><b>LAUREL:</b> No, Quinn, this is Laurel, can I
speak to Tiffany?<p><b>QUINN:</b> Oh, hi Mrs. Blum-Deckler.  She's not here. 
Did you try Stacy's?<p><i>Laurel looks worried.</i><p><b>LAUREL:</b> Stacy's
studying; her mother thought Tiffany might be with you.  Thanks.<p><i>Laurel
hangs up, and the screen returns to Quinn.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> Isn't Tiffany
working tonight?<p><b>QUINN:</b> I thought so, but her mother wouldn't be
calling us if she was, would she?<p><b>SANDI:</b> I guess.  Maybe she's out
with Jamie.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Yeah.  Anyway, I don't think there's anything we
can do about Robby.  There's nothing in the bylaws that would let us throw her
out for being unfashionable.  And, even if there were, the others would probably
see it as us trying to keep control.  We're better off just letting her vent. 
She'll get tired of it eventually if we don't respond, especially once she sees
we really are being fair.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Maybe, but if the little brat comes
that close to calling me a liar again, I swear I'll pound some sense into
her.<p><i>Quinn looks worriedly at Sandi.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> Um, you are
kidding, right?<p><b>SANDI:</b> Yeah.  If I thought violence solved anything,
I'd have killed you long ago. (smiles)<p><b>QUINN:</b> (nervous smile) Uh,
yeah.<p><b>Interior. Blum-Deckler Living Room - Night.</b><p><i>Laurel is
sitting on a couch, typing on a laptop balanced on her knees.  She wears an
intent, irritated expression, and her typing comes in quick, machine-gun bursts
punctuated by pauses while she scowls at the screen.  A cordless phone sits on
the couch next to her.  In one of her pauses, the door opens, and Tiffany
enters, looking tired. She's wearing a jacket over her usual
clothing.</i><p>
<b>TIFFANY:</b> (surprised) Mom!  You're home
early.<p>
<b>LAUREL:</b> (irritated) Early?  Young lady, it's nearly ten, where
have you been?<p>
<b>TIFFANY:</b> (tired) Out. Why?<p>
<i>Laurel sets the laptop
aside, roughly, and stands up, walking over to Tiffany.  She is clearly angry. 
She talks rapidly and emphatically; not yelling, but forceful, on the verge of
yelling.</i><p>
<b>LAUREL:</b> Why?  I'll tell you why!  I came home three hours
ago so we could spend some time together, and you're nowhere to be found!  I
called all of your friend's houses, and you weren't there!  I even called that
good-for-nothing boyfriend of yours, but his mother said he was out partying
with the other football players!  Were you with him? I've been worried
sick!<p>
<b>TIFFANY:</b> If you wanted to spend time with me, why didn't you
mention it at breakfast?<p>
<b>LAUREL:</b> That's no excuse!  I asked you a
question, were you with that good-for-nothing idiot?<p>
<b>TIFFANY: </b>His
name's Jamie!  And no, I wasn't with him, although I don't see what the problem
would be if I was.  You've never cared how I spend my evenings, as long as I get
my homework done and get to bed by eleven.<p>
<b>LAUREL:</b> I don't give a damn
what his name is, he's an empty-headed loser, just like your father was! And how
are you planning to do your homework in the next hour?<p>
<i>Tiffany has finally
become angry herself, although she's still clearly tired, and her outbursts lack
Laurel's energy.</i><p>
<b>TIFFANY:</b> It's Friday Mom, I'll do it over the
weekend, and who I date is none of your damned business!  Now, if you don't
mind, I'd really like to go to bed before I fall asleep standing here. 
Goodnight.<p>
<i>Tiffany turns to leave, taking the jacket off and hanging it on
a coat-rack by the door. Laurel continues talking to her back, still angry but
not quite as close to yelling.</i><p>
<b>LAUREL:</b> Oh, no you don't.  I want
to know where you were tonight, and what you've been doing that has you so
exhausted.  Are you doing drugs?<p>
<i>Tiffany turns around to face her, with
her Cashmans nametag clearly visible on her chest.</i><p>
<b>TIFFANY:</b> God,
Mom, no, I'm not on drugs, unless it's the same drug you've been doing all my
life.  I was at work, okay? And after six hours on my feet, running the
department single-handedly, I'm ready to drop, so if you're done with the third
degree, I'm going to bed now, okay?<p>
<i>Laurel stops talking, with a shocked
and breathless expression, as if she'd been punched in the gut.  Tiffany looks
at her with a concerned expression.</i><p>
<b>TIFFANY:</b> Mom? You
okay?<p>
<i>Laurel sits down, hard, on the arm of an easy chair, still looking
incredulously at Tiffany.</i><p><b>LAUREL:</b> Work?  You have a job?  When did
you get a job?  When were you going to tell me you had a job?  Why do you have a
job? Where are you working?  What are you doing?<p><i>Tiffany leans against the
wall, tired, but apparently having decided she's not going to get away from her
mother any time soon.</i><p><b>TIFFANY:</b> I'm working at Cashmans for the
Christmas rush.  I'm a clerk in the Junior Five department.  I'm doing it to
make money for college, so you won't have to work as hard. I just started
Monday. And I was going to tell you when I had a chance, but you've been talking
non-stop about the user manual you're working on all week, so I never had a
chance, okay?<p><b>LAUREL:</b> Oh.  I'm sorry dear. I have been rather excited
about work lately, haven't I?  But you should have said something anyway. You
know I'll talk for hours if you don't.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Yeah, well, I kind of
wanted to surprise you with my first paycheck.<p><b>LAUREL:</b> Oh, you've
surprised me all right. (chuckles weakly)<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Mom, you're not mad
I got a job, are you?<p><b>LAUREL:</b> I'm extremely upset that you didn't tell
me where you were going to be at night, but I'm not mad that you have a job. 
I'm proud of you, dear. That's quite a step to take.  And it's good to see you
putting your knowledge about clothing to good use.<p><i>Tiffany appears taken
aback by Laurel's approval, although she's still leaning on the wall and doesn't
react much.</i><p><b>TIFFANY:</b> You don't think I should be doing something
more serious?<p><b>LAUREL:</b> Tiffany, you know I think you spend too much
time on superficial things like clothing, but if that's really what excites you,
well, I can't complain too much.  I'd rather see you in a job where you have to
use some skill, even if it is about clothing, than in a menial job flipping
burgers at the food court, and there aren't that many skilled jobs for high
school students, anyway.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Flipping burgers actually pays
better, but I couldn't handle the thought of all of that grease.  Thanks.  So,
am I like grounded or anything?<p><i>Laurel walks over and hugs
Tiffany.</i><p><b>LAUREL:</b> Dear, do you have any free time you're not
spending at work or school?  I'm not sure grounding you would mean anything
right now.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Well, not much, no, but I have weekends off,
usually.<p><b>LAUREL:</b> I'm not going to ground you, anyway.  I don't think
you'll forget to tell me where you are in the future, will you?<p><i>Laurel
releases Tiffany from the hug, and smiles at her.  Tiffany smiles back,
tentatively.</i><p><b>TIFFANY:</b> No, I don't think so.<p><b>LAUREL:</b>
Fine, then, let's forget this evening ever happened.  I do want to spend some
time with you. How about tomorrow?<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Um, don't you work on
Saturday?<p><b>LAUREL:</b> I can afford to take one day off, especially if
you're earning money for school now.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Yeah, well, I have to
work this Saturday.  The store is putting on a winter fashion show in the
mall.<p><b>LAUREL:</b> Can't you get out of it?  You've been working all
week.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Um, not really.  I volunteered to run
it.<p><b>LAUREL:</b> (surprised, and approving) You did?<p><b>TIFFANY:</b>
Yeah.  It's extra hours, and I can get the kids from the Fashion Club to help in
exchange for discount coupons, so the store saves money they would have spent on
professional models. The manager's really happy about that.  He said it's cheap
advertising if your customers are giving the show themselves.<p><b>LAUREL:</b>
As long as they're doing it voluntarily.  I wouldn't want you forcing them to do
it as part of your club.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> No, they're all volunteers.  Only
about half the club signed up, but we've got nearly twenty people in the club
now, so that's plenty of models.  Um, I really need to go to sleep, Mom. I'm
dead on my feet.<p><b>LAUREL:</b> Okay, dear, we'll figure out some way to
spend some time together later.  Good night.<p><i>Tiffany turns, and walks

III</b><p><b>Interior. Mall Courtyard - Day.</b><p><b>A stage has been set up
in one of the side corridors of the mall, with overhead lights on a metal rail,
and curtains on the side and rear.  In front, several rows of folding chairs
face the stage, which is raised about two feet above the floor.  A scattering of
people, mostly students from Lawndale high we've seen in the background, sit in
the audience.  </b><p><i>Tiffany is off to one side of the stage, struggling
with some kind of electronic console as her mother walks
up.</i><p><b>LAUREL:</b> How's the show going, dear?<p><i>Tiffany starts, and
turns to her mother.</i><p>
<b>TIFFANY:</b> Mom!  What are you doing here?  I
thought you were going to work today.<p>
<b>LAUREL:</b> I did.  But I left early
to come watch your fashion show.  Aren't you supposed to have started by
now?<p>
<b>TIFFANY:</b> Yeah, but the technician called in sick, and I can't
figure out how to make the spotlight work.  It's supposed to be able to follow
people as they walk onstage, but I can't figure out how.<p>
<b>LAUREL:</b> Let
me see, I used to be a theatre nerd in high school.  This equipment's different
from what I used, but there's only so many things it needs to do, so I ought to
be able to figure it out.<p>
<i>Tiffany steps to one side, and Laurel begins to
flip switches, turning lights on and off above the stage.</i><p>
<b>TIFFANY:</b>
Great, see what you can do.  I'm going to start the show, if the lights don't
work, we'll just have to live with it.<p>
<b>LAUREL:</b> Good
plan.<p>
<i>Tiffany walks up onto the stage, and starts to talk.  After a few
words, her voice gets louder, as Laurel turns a knob on her panel and the PA
system starts to work.</i><p>
<b>TIFFANY:</b> (quiet) Ladies and Gentlemen,
welcome to the Cashmans winter fashion spectacular, (voice gets louder) up
first, we have Lisa, modeling an outfit for the ski season.<p>
<i>Tiffany walks
off stage, as Lisa walks on in darkness.  As Lisa approaches the front of the
stage, the spotlight comes one, and pans over to light where she's standing. 
Tiffany walks over to stand next to her mother, who is working the lighting
board with intense concentration.</i><p>
<b>TIFFANY:</b> (to Laurel) You got it!
Thanks, Mom.<p>
<b>LAUREL:</b> Hey, no problem.  This is fun.  I wish we'd had
one of these when I was in school.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> I'm glad you came, and not
just because of the lights.<p><i>Laurel glances over at her daughter with an
affectionate smile, then quickly returns her attention to the
controls.</i><p><b>LAUREL:</b> Thanks, Tiffany, I'm glad too.<p><b>Interior.
Morgendorffer Kitchen - Morning.</b><p><i>Daria is at the table, eating cereal,
when Helen walks in.  She pulls a half of a grapefruit from the refrigerator and
brings it to the table.</i><p><b>HELEN:</b> Good morning,
sweetie.<p><b>DARIA:</b> (muffled through a mouthful of cereal) 'mrning
Mm.<p><b>HELEN:</b> What?<p><i>Daria swallows.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> I said,
'Good morning, Mom', haven't you learned to interpret cereal English
yet?<p><b>HELEN:</b> No.  I persist in the hope that someday my daughters will
learn to swallow their food before they start talking.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Hah! I
thought lawyers were supposed to understand human nature.<p><i>Helen looks at
Daria with a tolerant smile.</i><p><b>HELEN:</b> It's a mother's prerogative to
hope, even when she knows better.  Speaking of which, have you decided what
you're going to do about your job offer yet?<p><b>DARIA:</b> Nope.<p><i>Daria
takes a bite of cereal, and chews it, glancing over at her mother.  Helen sighs,
but doesn't rise to the bait. Daria finishes chewing, and swallows the
cereal.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Mom, what's your real reason for wanting me to take
this job?<p><b>HELEN:</b> (defensive) I didn't say I wanted you to take it. 
It's your decision.<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> (addressing an invisible personage above
the table) Objection, your honor!  Defense is evading the
question.<p><b>HELEN:</b> Oh, very well.  I told you my reason: it would be
good to have some extra money, and it will help your college
applications.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Mom, would you try something that thin on a jury?
If I worked from now until summer, and saved every penny, I might have a couple
of thousand dollars.  That's not chicken feed, but it's hardly going to make a
big difference compared to the cost of the schools we've been talking about.
And, as for my applications, I already have the experience from the internship;
this job doesn't really change anything.<p><b>HELEN:</b> Two thousand dollars
would be enough to get you a used car for school, or do you want to spend the
entire semester without seeing us?<p><i>Daria looks at her mother with a
speculative glint in her eye.</i><p><b>HELEN:</b> Spare me the cheap shot,
that's a serious question.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Oh, all right, take away all my fun.
Yeah, it would be nice to be able to come visit.  I need someone to do my
laundry, after all.  But are those your only reasons?<p><b>HELEN:</b> Well, no,
I also think it's important for you to get out and meet other people, and the
internship has been good for that, from what you've said.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Yes,
although that will be less true of a night job. (sighs)  There is something to
what you say. (Helen looks up from her grapefruit with surprise) I want to be a
writer, and a writer needs to understand people.  I can't do that without
meeting them, however much I might want to.<p><i>Helen looks at Daria, her
grapefruit forgotten, blinking in surprise.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Hello?  Earth
to Mom, are you there?<p><b>HELEN:</b> Daria, I'm...  I'm...<p><b>DARIA:</b>
Stunned? Catatonic? Pining for the fjords?<p><b>HELEN:</b>
Surprised.<p><b>DARIA:</b> (embarrassed) Yeah, well, don't tell anyone.  I
don't want to ruin a perfectly good reputation as a sociopath.<p><b>HELEN:</b>
You have too much of a conscience to be a sociopath.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Damn
conscience. (looks at Helen accusingly) It's all your fault.<p><b>HELEN:</b>
(amused) Well, your father shares the blame, but I'll plead guilty with
pleasure.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Bet that doesn't happen too often.<p><b>HELEN:</b>
(smiling) I think this is a first.  So, are you going to take the
job?<p><b>DARIA:</b> I'm still thinking, but your position is making
headway.<p><b>HELEN:</b> Then I can go to work with my conscience
clear.<p><b>DARIA:</b> I thought lawyers were required to leave those at home
in the morning?<p><b>HELEN:</b> (amused) I should know you'd find a way to get
in the last word.<p><b>DARIA:</b> (smiling) You should, yes.<p><b>Interior.
School Cafeteria - Lunchtime.</b><p><b>Robby is sitting at a table with several
other girls from the Fashion Club meeting.  None of the original four FC members
is present.</b><p><b>ROBBY:</b> So Tiffany says to me that my earrings are
fine, but I should wear gold ones instead of silver because of my skin
tone.<p><b>GIRL1:</b> But Quinn said we needed to balance
them.<p><b>GIRL2:</b> Yeah, like art.<p><b>ROBBY:</b> Well, what I remember
from Art class is that different people have different ideas of what makes good
art, and one group's rules aren't always obeyed by another group of artists. 
Tiffany said that Quinn was conservative, but that didn't mean that you had to
be conservative to be fashionable.<p><b>GIRL2:</b> I suppose. I saw Tiffany at
the store the other day, and she certainly knows what she's talking
about.<p><b>ROBBY:</b> Right.  That's why I'm going to write her in for
President when we have the election.  We need someone in charge who doesn't
think that their way is the only way.  Even if we only get enough votes to make
her Vice President, that will help bring some sense to the club.  So, can I
count on you to write her in too?<p><i>The group nods in agreement, talking
quietly to each other.</i><p><b>Interior. Technical Support

a paternal tone) Now son, if your sister wants to fill her head with all these
strange notions, that's her business.<p><b>DARIA:</b> (mock annoyed) And just
what is so strange about Voltaire?  I suppose you think I should be reading Star
Trek novels?<p><b>BEN:</b> Heaven forbid!  That's so last century.  Star Wars
novels are the in thing now.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Oh, there's a
difference?<p><b>JERRY:</b> (to Ben) Can we stone the infidel now,
huh?<p><b>BEN:</b> (to Jerry) Now, now, she's free to have her own opinions,
even when they're wrong.<p><b>DARIA:</b> That's what I like about you two:
you're so open-minded.  I guess that's why I decided to take the
job.<p><b>JERRY:</b> (emotionless) Cool.<p><b>BEN:</b> (approving) Yeah, what
he said, only with feeling.  Glad to have you back aboard.  What made you change
your mind?<p><b>DARIA:</b> The sudden realization that I needed to meet more
people.<p><b>BEN:</b> And that has exactly what to do with crawling around
empty offices in the middle of the night trying to find broken
wires?<p><b>DARIA:</b> I'm still not too clear on that part.  It made sense
yesterday.<p><b>JERRY:</b> I want some of what she's having.<p><b>BEN:</b> (to
Jerry) No, you're confused enough already.<p><b>DARIA:</b> So, to celebrate, I
finished off all the trouble calls.  Who's up for a game of

Okay, Jodie, that's everyone.<p><b>JODIE:</b> Very well, you and Robby open the

you go.<p><i>Jodie turns to Robby.</i><p><b>JODIE:</b> You agree with this
count. (Robby nods, unhappy about something, but agreeing) Okay, so let's see. 
For President, we have four votes each for Sandi and Quinn, two for Lisa, and
eight write-in votes for Tiffany.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> But I wasn't running for
office!<p><b>JODIE:</b> Well, that's what a write-in vote is for, to elect
someone who isn't running.<p><b>ROBBY:</b> We voted for you because we think
you can do the job best, Tiffany.  You're the only one who understands that
there's more than one kind of fashion.<p><b>JODIE:</b> You can decline the
position, of course, in which case we'll need to have a run-off election to
decide between Quinn and Sandi.<p><i>Tiffany pauses briefly before
replying.</i><p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Uh, no, if people want me to be President that
badly, I'll give it a try.<p><b>JODIE:</b> Okay, we still have the minor
problem that Quinn and Sandi are tied for Vice President, so I guess we'll have
to have a run-off anyway.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Or, we could share
it.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Share it?  How?<p><b>SANDI:</b> Well, we could take turns.
One week I'd do the Vice Presidential stuff and you'd do the Coordinating
Officer stuff, and the next week we'd switch.<p><b>JODIE:</b> Well, it's a
little irregular, but there's nothing that prohibits doing that, if you both
agree.<p><b>QUINN: </b>Sure, this should be interesting.  So, who got the other
positions?<p><b>JODIE:</b> Well, Stacy took Treasurer with seventeen votes
against one for her competitor, Brooke.<p><b>STACY:</b> (stunned) Seventeen? 
But that's everyone...except Brooke.<p>
<b>BROOKE:</b> Well, I couldn't very
well vote against myself.  What can I say? Congratulations, you've been a good
Secretary so far, and everyone can see that.<p>
<b>STACY:</b> (still stunned)
Thanks.  (looks around, emotional) Thanks, everyone.  I'm so
happy.<p>
<b>JODIE:</b> And finally, Treasurer goes to Robby, on a write-in,
with seven votes, against six and five for your two
competitors.<p>
<b>ROBBY:</b> But, I wasn't running.<p>
<b>TIFFANY:</b>
(smiling) I tried that excuse; it doesn't work.<p>
<i>One of the girls Robby was
plotting the Tiffany write-in with earlier speaks up.</i><p>
<b>GIRL1:</b> Well,
we figured if we could write Tiffany in for President, we could write you in for
Treasurer.  You really care about keeping the club honest, and that's important
for the Treasurer.<p>
<b>ROBBY:</b> But...<p><b>SANDI:</b> Oh, give it a rest,
now you'll get to see how much work it is on this side of the
desk.<p>
<b>TIFFANY:</b> Yep, if I have to be President, you'll have to be
Treasurer.  If you don't take the position, I'll resign, and Quinn and Sandi can
duke it out for the Presidency.<p>
<b>ROBBY:</b> (annoyed) Oh, hell... all
right, I guess I won, dammit.<p>

			<p><b>Author's Notes:</b><p>
Gah!  I'm done!  I
set out to write a story about Tiffany's relationship with her mother, against
the backdrop of the rebuilding of the Fashion Club.  It turned out to be harder
than I expected.  Creating Laurel was easy, but creating a convincing tension
between the two, and resolving it, took a lot of work.  At least, I hope it was
convincing.  Of all my stories, I think this one went through the most changes
from original conception to finish.  Not big changes, just adding and dropping
scenes, and one wholesale restructuring of the sequence to pack what had
sprawled over three weeks into one (believe me, it's much more readable now).
<p>
One of the problems with this story (or maybe it's its strength, but it sure
made the writing hard) is that there are too many threads woven together.  We
have the two mother/daughter elements, the fashion club politics, and the two
jobs, which are really part of the mother/daughter elements, so there's really
only three plots lines.  The last time I used three plots in one story (<i>The
Butterfly Storm</i>) I swore I'd never do it again, yet here I am, and with more
complexity this time.  You'd think I'd learn.  But that was the way the story
came together, and trying to remove any of the three would make it a weaker
story, I think, so I persevered.  I hope the result was fun to read.<p>By the
way, lest the above make it sound like I didn't enjoy writing this, I did.  I
wouldn't spend this much time doing something if, in the end, I wasn't enjoying
myself.<p>Robby - She was fun to create.  I thought about using one of the
existing non-speaking characters (there's a dark-haired Goth in Quinn's English
class I considered), but finally I decided it was better to avoid the baggage an
existing character might bring.  Since we've only seen a couple of Quinn's
classes, and there are bound to be students in the same grade who don't have the
same classes anyway, it shouldn't be surprising for someone previously unseen to
appear.<p>Tiffany - Just in case anyone's noticed that Tiffany's character in
this story isn't much like her character in the TV show, you're right.  As
established back in <i>Breaking Strain</i>, she was actually smarter than she
let on, and kept to herself to avoid Sandi taking her intelligence as a
challenge (as Sandi did Quinn's) and throwing her out of the club.  Once the
club broke up, she felt she could be herself, and eventually (by <i>Love's
Labours Undone</i>) began to get along with Sandi anyway.  The other three
should be fairly close to their show characters, although Sandi has become less
domineering, and Stacy tends to stand up for herself more (although she's still
fairly timid).  Quinn, alone, hasn't really changed, but her relationship with
Sandi is less strained.<p>Laurel - One of my goals in defining Laurel was to
come up with someone who might explain why Tiffany tends to hang back, and not
talk too much.  Being an only child of a single parent who was always working
(leaving no one at home to talk to), and who talks non-stop when she is home,
seemed like a logical explanation.  I also wanted someone Daria could relate to
(hence making her a tech writer) so that I could tie the Daria/Helen and
Tiffany/Laurel bits together.<p>Technical Writing - I'm not a tech writer by
profession (although I've done technical writing), but I've worked with a
variety of them, both temps and full-time professionals, with backgrounds
ranging from English majors to ex-Computer salespeople.  Laurel's comments on
the field reflect my observations: it's not a bad job, usually, but it's not
particularly respected either; job security is very low, because there's a
never-ending stream of warm bodies waiting to take the work, even if many of
them are barely literate.  There are companies that hire full-time tech writers,
but when times turn bad they're among the first to be laid off, so job security
isn't much better than being a temp.<p>Other notes:<p>The events recapped at
the beginning are from the three preceding stories: <i>Breaking Strain</i>,
<i>Strange Bedfellows</i>, and <i>Love's Labours Undone</i>.<p>"Remember back
before the club broke up, when Brooke and Lisa beat us to the new styles at the
sale?" - Tiffany is talking about an incident that was mentioned in <i>Breaking
Strain</i>.<p>Coordinating Officer - Tiffany's duties, including the three-day
forecast, come from Sandi's list of Fashion Club Job Descriptions in <i>The
Daria Database</i> (Pocket Books, 1998).<p>"Well, I don't think Ms. Li is going
to release any school money to us this year." - After Stacy and Tiffany quit the
club, Sandi had to tell Ms. Li that they weren't going to be doing a Fall
Fashion Show after all.  Ms. Li had already printed tickets, and was very
annoyed at losing the money.  She made Sandi work as a guide on a school hiking
trip to make up for the spent money. This all occurred at the beginning of
<i>Strange Bedfellows</i>.<p>"Chuck showed me how to use the word processor in
the computer lab" - He doesn't show up in this story, but Upchuck (Chuck) has
been Sandi's boyfriend since <i>Strange Bedfellows</i>.  I wanted to work him
and Jamie (Tiffany's boyfriend since the same story) in, but there didn't seem
to be any place where they fit, so I settled for just mentioning the two of
them.<p>Ben and Jerry first appeared in <i>Breaking Strain</i>.  I received
several requests to bring them back.  I hope you're happy. :-)<p>"Well, I lied
about my age." - I don't recommend this course of action.  Employers check ages,
and getting caught lying on a job application usually results in being fired. 
Most stores won't let a minor work a register unattended for insurance reasons,
so it was a dramatic necessity if I wanted Tiffany working on her own, but it
wouldn't be a good idea in the real world.<p>"Pining for the fjords?" - From
the Monty Python parrot sketch, about a man trying to return a dead bird to a
pet store, and the salesclerk telling him the bird's not dead, just "pining for
the fjords."  I didn't really need to explain that to anyone, did I?<p>The
future - Well, after I finished the previous story in this series, I said I was
done with it.  Then I got the idea for this one.  I don't have a sequel in mind,
and I'm presently working on two other Daria stories, so there won't be a
successor any time soon, but I've learned not to say "never".<p><b>THE
