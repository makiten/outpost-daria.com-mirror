<P>Daria sat on the front step in the moonlight reflecting on the fact
that it had been a bad day.</P>

<P>She'd been on a short fuse ever since she got up this morning. She'd
snarled at Jane at school and, when Quinn had commented on the fact that
her coat needed cleaning, she'd snapped her head off.</P>

<P>The neighbour's dog howled. Dammit. No wonder she'd been having an off
day. She looked at Quinn's head where she'd left it on the driveway and
scratched at the screen door with her paw. She was on heat. </P>
