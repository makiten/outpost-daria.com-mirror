 Where we last left off. Uki tutu told his pal Yikki Uni they had to find the
 magical... Oops wrong story.

 Seriously where we last left off. Sandi Griffin was raped by a guy. She seeked
 Joanna for help, then tried to commint suicide. After talking her out of it.They
 try to talk to her mom once more, but at the site of two Sandi's; Linda faints.

 Now on to Part 2:

 Scene 1: We see Sandi, and Joanna around Linda.

 Sandi: Like what are we going to do?

 Joanna: Hmm... well just say we look alike.

 Linda stirs, groans.

 Linda: What happened?

 Joanna: Nothing Mrs G.

 Linda: Sandi?

 Sandi: No I'm Sandi.

 Linda: (Snaps) Wait a minute how come you two so damn alike? Sandi is this a
 cheap trick?

 Joanna: None at all. We just look alike. Rest assured that we have hardly
 anything in common.

 Linda: Will Sandi did you come home to realize that this so called "Rape" thing
 was all in your head?

 Sandi: (Starts crying) Mom I don't see why you have to be my mom.

 Joanna: She was raped.

 Sandi: And how would you know?

 Joanna: (Fuming) Look Mrs. "I'm so damn fucking high and mighty that I can't
 realize if my own flesh, and blood daughter has something wrong with her, cuz I
 have my damn fucking head stuck up my ass"! You're daughter was raped. Alright?

 Linda: (Startled) I umm...

 Sandi: Mom I need to go get some tests.

 Joanna: Yeah see ya. (They walk off.)

 Scene 2: In Joanna's car which happens to be a sting ray convertable.

 Sandi: I'm scared.

 Joanna: Just chill everything will turn out o.k. I hope.

 Sandi: But what if I'm pregnant, or have an STD?

 Joanna: Hmm good question. Will here we are.

 (The car pulls up to the parking lot of Unplanned Parent Hood. Sandi, and Joanna
 step out, and walk in.)

 Scene 3: Inside the building.

 Receptionist: O.K which one of you?

 Joanna: Her.

 R: And you're name?

 Sandi: Sandi Griffin.

 R: I didn't know you had a twin sister.

 Joanna: We just look alike.

 R: O.K will be with you in just a moment.

 Sandi: "Sigh" Alright.

 Scene 4: We see a shot of Neil's house. Pan to a room where we see him looking
 at a computer screen. He clicks off of it. We see a detailed look of him. He has
 dark brown crisp hair, perfectly cut. A pretty good face, broad shoulders, and a
 200 lb build at 6'2.

 Neil: You bitch Sandi. I'm going to get you again. It's going to be worse
 though. Now I have more ideas. Oh yeah you damn bitches love that stuff.

 Scene 5: Back to Unplanned Parent Hood.

 After 5 hours the doctor walks in.

 Doctor: Sandi we got the pregnancy test, and the results are negative. However
 on the STD's the results show that you may have genital herpes. Will give you
 more accurate results in a week.

 Sandi: You mean I could have?
 (She starts crying. Joanna pats her.)

 Joanna: Come on.

 Sandi: *sniff* Alright.

 Scene 6: Show the Lawndale Prison. Inside one of the cells we see Evan, Knife,
 and Brad.

 Knife: Hey we hear that another girl got raped.

 Brad: You a part of it pretty boy?

 Evan: No sir.

 Knife: O.K we believe ya kid, but we're keeping close tabs on ya.

 Brad: Yep.

 Evan: *sigh*

 Scene 7: We see Jane in her room with Brandon. They're into some pretty heavy
 making out when Mystyk Spiral walks in.

 Trent: Hey Janey..

 Max: Like damn! They're hot and into it!

 Jesse: We should come back later.

 Jane: (Looks embarressed.) Umm what did you want Trent?

 Brandon: Umm who are they?

 Jane: This i Trent, and his stupid friends. I used to date Jesse.

 Jesse: You take care of her man.

 Brandon: I will.

 Trent: We're sorry about you friends rape.

 Jane: Yeah it just tears me up that this crime is still going on.

 Brandon: Jane eventually that jerk will pay.

 Scene 8: One week later Sandi gets the results of the test. She opens them up,
 and looks. In moments she's sobbing.

 Joanna: Get the results?
 (Sandi hands her the paper. Joanna reads it.)
 Genital Herpes. That bastard going to pay.

 (They walk inside the house. When inside Joanna picks up the phone.)

 Sandi: You're not calling the police are you?

 Joanna: One way,or another the bastard going to pay.
 (Picks up phone, and dials. We only hear her end of the conversation.)
 Hello police?---I'd like to report a rape-----On Sandi Griffin.----By Neil
 Hobbes.-----What!?----You think I'm lying?-----Oh! Neils all so wonderful!. He
 makes straght A's. He's oh so fucking perfect! So he can rape whoever he

 to go.(She runs out the front door.)

 mens restroom, a pair of hands grab her, and drag her in.

 Sandi:(Whimpers)

 Neil:Heard you called the police? They wouldn't help you. Right?

 Sandi:(Whimpers)

 Neil:Right?

 Sandi:(Nods her head.)

 Neil: Want to know why they wouldn't help? Because everyone knows you deserved
 what happened to you.

 Sandi:(Gives out a muffled scream.)

 Neil:Now, now. No need to get freakish. I hope you realize I was only teaching
 you a lesson. That you can't treat people like shit. I still love you, but I had
 to teach you. (Kisses her.Walks off.)

 Sandi:(Frozen) Somebody HELP ME!!

 Britney:Mmm, Daria I'm like sorry about that girls rape.

 Daria:Yeah. Umm thanks for your support.

 Kevin: But dude I heard that she's just saying he raped her; so that way they
 can run away, and create little demons.

 Jane:Where the hell did you hear that from?

 (While he's thinking Joanna twists, and breaks his arm that has the gun in it.
 The gun drops to the floor.)

 Neil:Oh I can do that with one hand. (He reaches for the gun, but Sandi kicks it
 away.)Dammit!

 Trent:Give up man.

 Daria:He's dead. How?

 Joanna: Broke his brainstem.

 Sandi:It's over?

 Jane: Hopefully. Unless...
 (They wait for him to pop up again, but he doesn't.)

 Joanna:It's over. Come on go home. It's over.

 Sandi: I really thought he loved me. Before he raped me. (Starts sobbing.) I'm
 never going to fall in love again.

 Joanna:Yes you will. One of these days you will.

 Scene 14: We see Sandi walk in her house.

 Linda:Sandi is that you?

 Sandi: Yeah.Mom here. (Hands her the tests, and a tape.)

 Linda:(Reads thing) Oh Sandi you have genital herpes?

 Linda: What's this tape? (puts it in a player. We hear the whole terryifying
 convo in the bedroom.)Oh my God Sandi. I'm so sorry. I've been in denial.

 Sandi: (Sobs.) That won't be enough. Next to him you hurt me the most. I don't
 know if I'll ever forgive you.

 Linda:Please Sandi try?

 (Sandi walks away.)
