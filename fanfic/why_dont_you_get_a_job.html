<P>"You're Standing On My Neck" begins to play, but the title sequence will be 
as follows:</P>It is night. Camera sweeps over a rooftop. Stop on Mara, who nods 
her head and says: "All right. If we're gonna do it." She turns her head to the 
right and continues: "Let's do the bloody thing right" . Music begins now.
<P></P>Mack and Damien are in Shakespearian costumes. Mack has his head shaved. 
He looks absolutely <B>PISSED</B> he grabs Damien and pushes him into a 
rectangular pool of water at the front of the stage.
<P></P>Daria and Darren are standing in what looks like a fast food kitchen. 
They are wearing rather embarrassing uniforms that have the American Flag design 
on them. There is an older man standing between them. He grabs his head and 
falls over backward. Daria and Darren look at him, look at each other, and 
shrug.
<P></P>We see O'Neill standing, in the auditorium, next to a middle aged woman. 
Suddenly, Damien runs into the shot and tackles her.
<P></P>Total Darkness. Then a light shines on what looks like a ladder. We see 
two figures drop in front of the camera.
<P></P>Mara is sitting in a conference room. She looks bored as all hell. She 
then pulls out a book called: "Vaseline, gasoline, and five hundred other ways 
to make plastic explosives".
<P></P>Miranda is standing on stage at what looks like a school dance of some 
kind. She is playing a guitar, In the background, Darren is playing bass, Damien 
is playing drums, and a male Kinsington relation is on the other guitar. Darren 
is wearing a dress shirt, unbuttoned, a white t-shirt underneath, black slacks, 
and black Doc Martins. Damien is shirtless. Miranda is playing what looks like a 
very complicated solo. Trent is staring at her in awe
<P></P>Upchuck is accosting Daria and Jane in the theatre. Miranda grabs him and 
pulls him off camera. Daria and Jane look in their direction, then exchange 
looks of nausea.
<P></P>Our heroes are standing in front of a bulletin board reading a notice. 
Camera moves down the line. Daria looks impassive, Jane looks shocked, Damien 
has a scowl, Darren looks angry, Miranda looks absolutely <B>pissed.</B> She is 
breathing heavily, gnashing her teeth, and her left eye is twitching. she closes 
her eyes and screams something.
<P></P>Stacy is running down the halls of Lawndale High, with Sandi running 
after her holding a bloody Chainsaw.
<P></P>Close up on Daria, who smirks as the Daria Logo comes up over a blue 
background.
<P></P>
<P>Daria in: Why Don't You Get A Job?</P>
<HR>

<P></P><B>EXT:</B> Lawndale High
<P></P><B>Music:</B> "The World Is Not Enough" By Garbage
<P></P><B>Scene 1:</B> The theater. Damien and Mack are standing on stage, 
rehearsing. Miranda is in the front row of the house, translating
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> But Iago, what lights come yonder.
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> (worried) Those are the raiséd father and his friends. You 
were best go in. (he tries to hustle Mack offstage. Mack stops him)
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> (Defiant) Not I. I must be found. My parts, title, and 
perfect fortune shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?
<P></P>Damien looks offstage. Enter Kevin and the guy playing the solder. (Who, 
for the purpose of the series, we'll call James)
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> (looking relieved) By Janus, I think no.
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> (happy) Servant of the Duke, and my lieutenant. The goodness 
of the night upon you friends. What is the news?
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> (confused) Like, why would I read the newspaper, bro. 
That's what brains do
<P></P>James rolls his eyes, Mack puts his head in his hands.
<P></P><B>CUT TO:</B> O'Neill
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> That was a very good...um...entrance, Charles. But your 
line is (looks at the script. starts overacting) "The Duke doth greet you, 
general. And he requires your haste post-haste appearance, even on the instant.
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> Oh, (pause) O.K.
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> Now, lets try that again
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> (sarcastically, to himself) Take fourteen
<P></P><B>James:</B> (sarcastically) Fifteen
<P></P><B>Scene 2:</B> Later that day.
<P></P>The cast is sitting in the house. O'Neill is giving them some bad news.
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> Um, Guys? I have some good news, and some bad news
<P></P><B>CUT TO:</B> Daria and Darren
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> He's getting someone more competent to direct?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> What do you mean <I>more</I> competent
<P></P><B>CUT BACK TO:</B> O'Neill
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> I just found out that the budget for the play is a little 
less than I expected.
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> What is the budget?
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> Well, (looks at a sheet of paper) Ms. Li has given us 
$1000 of the school budget for this.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> That's <I>it</I>?!
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> That's pretty generous. (Darren looks at her) Well, for her 
anyway.
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> (turns happy) But, I found a way to remedy the situation. 
I just found out that Five Banners Grand Country has a program that lets people 
work there as a fund raiser. (excited) And I signed us up to work there next 
Saturday.
<P></P><B>CUT TO:</B> OH's who have a look of abject horror
<P></P><B>Scene 3</B> Lawndale High Parking Lot, Night
<P></P>Damien, Darren, Miranda, and Daria are walking towards Darren's Car
<P></P>Music: "Pure Morning" by Placebo
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> I'm going to go up to him, calmly explain why is a 
phenomenally bad idea, and very slowly kill him.
<P></P><B>Daria</B> (deadpan) You need help?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Yeah, you hold him down, I'll perform the death of a 
thousand cuts.
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> Just out of curiosity, what the hell <I>is</I> "Five 
Banners Grand Country" anyway?
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> It's an amusement park in Leeville.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (sighs) Oh well, at least I won't have to suffer alone. 
(stares at Damien)
<P></P>Damien looks at Darren. He looks confused and kind of scared
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> (to Miranda) Why is he looking at me?
<P></P>Miranda explains to him
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> Oh. I...kind of...got out of that.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> What?! (surprised, slightly angry) How'd you manage that?
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> There's this huge international deaf social in Oakwood on 
Saturday
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (under his breath) Great.
<P></P>They get to Darren's car. a near mint condition black 1967 Ford Shelby 
Mustang GT500
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> Holy Crap. is that yours?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Yup. Our uncle Desmond gave it to us when we turned 18.
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> Us?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Yeah, Damien and I. You...<I>do</I> know we're twins, 
right?
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> (nods her head) How did your uncle afford it?
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> (shrugs) He's sort of a curator. Anything you want, he'll 
get for you within 24 hours.
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> How?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> We don't know. and none of us have the bollocks to ask 
him.
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> Mafia?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Well, that's my theory (smirks)
<P></P>Darren opens the drivers side door and gets in. Miranda gets in the back 
seat, Damien is riding Shotgun
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> So, you need a ride home?
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> No thanks. I'll see you tomorrow. (walks away)
<P></P><B>CUT TO COMMERCIAL</B> Stinger: Darren looking surprised when O'neill 
explains the budget problem
<P></P><B>Scene 4:</B> The bus ride to hell
<P></P><B>Music:</B> The opening keyboard riff to "The Thing I Hate" by Stabbing 
Westward
<P></P>Daria and Darren are sitting together. Brittany and Kevin are making out 
in the seat in front of them. Quinn and the three J's are sitting together. 
Quinn is talking on a cell phone. O'Neill is at the front, speaking to the cast
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> (enthusiastic) Good morning class. I hope you all had a 
restful sleep last night
<P></P>Everyone groans rather loudly. O'neill is taken a bit aback. He was 
hoping that the other students were as stupidly optimistic as he.
<P></P><B>CUT TO:</B> Daria and Darren, who look REALLY tired. Daria also looks 
like she's going to throw up
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (groans) It's too early in the day for this. (looks at 
Daria) What's wrong?
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> (looking very sick) I'm going to be sick. Could you open a 
window?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Oh, I got some Dramamine in my bag if you want it.
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> It's not motion sickness, it's the fumes. It smells 
like...like...
<P></P>Darren looks at Kevin and Brittany in the seat in front of them. He taps 
Kevin on the head
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (to Kevin and Brittany) Um, could you two lovebirds not do 
that here?
<P></P><B>Brittany:</B> (to Kevin) Ugh, He's been spying on us!
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> Yeah, what a...um...what's the word?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (sarcastically) Pervert? Yes, well when you're shagging 
each other on a bus carrying about forty other people, I don't think that 
there's much you can keep private.
<P></P>Kevin and Brittany look around and realise where they are
<P></P><B>Brittany:</B> (like a deer in headlights) Eep (or Eap, whatever)
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (to Daria) Better?
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> (still sick) Not really
<P></P>Darren reaches into his backpack and pulls out an air sickness bag.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Here, if all else fails...
<P></P>Enter Upchuck
<P></P><B>Upchuck:</B> Well, what have we here. Is our precious Daria unwell? I 
have just the cure, but be careful it doesn't cause a fever (growls)
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> (bluntly) Upchuck, Go away. I'm really not in the mood
<P></P><B>Upchuck:</B> (growls again) Well, how 'bout we meet after work and...
<P></P>Darren grabs him with his (Darren's) right hand so they are face to face. 
Darren's left hand is in his backpack.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Listen you stupid $#!7, I want you to think back to the 
worst pain you've ever felt. Now, (as he's saying this, he pulls out a rather 
painful looking probe from his backpack) imagine something (shows Upchuck the 
probe, he whispers) <I>ten times worse</I>
<P></P>He lets go of Upchuck.
<P></P><B>Upchuck:</B> (trying to save face) Well, You can't resist me forever. 
I'll get you yet, my pretty (walks away)
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> And your little dog too
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Feeling better?
<P></P>Daria gives him a semi-pathetic look.
<P></P><B>Scene 5:</B> The employee parking lot of "Grand Country"
<P></P>We see Mack get off. followed by Kevin and Brittany, who look like they 
have been making out again. Then Darren gets off and deposits a rather full 
air-sickness bag into the trash. Daria follows him, rinsing her mouth out with 
water. She spits and gives Darren a water bottle, which he puts it in his 
backpack.
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> What don't you have in there?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Just the technology that could, singlehandedly, cause a 
global thermonuclear holocaust. But I'm working on that. (grins)
<P></P><B>Scene 6:</B> The employee office
<P></P>The cast is sitting around a big conference table. A rather annoyingly 
perky supervisor (who we'll call PHB) is talking to them. In the background is 
an easel. on it is a big paper pad with the words "How does this help the park" 
written on it.
<P></P><B>PHB:</B> (To Daria) Yes, before you even do <I>that</I>, you must 
first ask... (goes to the easel, points to each word as he says it) "How does 
this help the park?"
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> (deadpan) By confining all bodily fluids to the toilets
<P></P>The PHB laughs nervously
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> What exactly are we gonna be doing all day?
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> (excited) Yeah, I hope we get to run the games. I like the 
"Whack a Mole"!
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> I figured as much (authors note: This probably sounds much 
naughtier than it really is)
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> "Whack a Mole?" American Football player? What's the 
difference?
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> (deadpan) Both have taken one too many hits to the head
<P></P>Darren tries to stifle a laugh
<P></P><B>Darren</B> Good one, Michael
<P></P><B>PHB:</B> (to Kevin) Wow! I really like you're enthusiasm, but no. 
You'll actually be working in the food service today
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> Great, I've always wanted to wear the lingering smell of 
fried chicken
<P></P><B>PHB:</B> (missing the sarcasm) Great! Now, let's you get into your 
uniforms
<P></P><B>Scene 7:</B> the Men's employee locker room
<P></P>Darren is trying to stuff his backpack into a locker. Mack is changing 
into a rather embarrassing "American Flag" designed uniform.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Um, Michael? Could you help me with this? (to the 
backpack) Get in there, Damn You!
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> Sure, and call me Mack, please
<P></P><B>Darren</B> Oh. Erm, sorry
<P></P>They both push the backpack into the locker and close the door. An 
employee comes up to Darren, hands him a straight razor and a small cup of 
shaving cream, and walks away
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Is my goatee that visible?
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> Kinda, yeah
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (under his breath) Great, Just what I've always felt I 
needed. Shaving cuts. 
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> Don't worry. Just don't jerk it and don't go side to side.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Right, thanks
<P></P>He walks offscreen. about a minute later, we hear him scream...
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> OW! BOLLACKS!
<P></P><B>Scene 8:</B> Inside the park
<P></P>The Cast is walking to the various kitchens where they'll be working. 
Everyone has the same uniform on, along with navy blue visors with the park 
name. Quinn is looking it at in utter disgust. Darren has a large piece of gauze 
taped to his cheek.
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> (referring to his bandage) So, how many health violations 
do you think that'll break?
<P></P><B>Darren</B> Well, I think that their theory is that, as long as they 
keep me out of sight, they won't have any problems. (shakes his head) I'll bet 
Damien's having the time of his life right now.
<P></P><B>CUT TO:</B> The gym at Oakwood high. Camera pans left, showing a bunch 
of people sitting around looking excited. Stop on Damien and Miranda, who both 
look bored as all hell. Everyone around them get up and waves their hands in the 
air. Damien reaches into his backpack and pulls out a huge book called "The 
Complete Unified Field Theory." Miranda pulls out a book called "Die Broke." 
Offscreen, we hear a young male voice.
<P></P><B>Voice:</B> I take it he's been to one of these before?
<P></P>Miranda taps Damien on the shoulder and relays the guy's question.
<P></P>Damien looks to his right and signs something
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> He said "The trick is to bring a book big enough"
<P></P><B>Voice:</B> Got anything else in there?
<P></P>Damien reaches into his backpack, pulls out another large book and hands 
it offscreen
<P></P><B>Voice:</B> "How to get Anything on Anybody"?
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> Volume 2. Take a gander at the section on auto tailing
<P></P><B>Voice:</B> (after a couple of beats) Oh man, Can I show this to 
someone?
<P></P>Damien nods. A couple beats later, he and Miranda both look offscreen 
right, look at each other, and shrug. Damien goes back to his book
<P></P><B>CUT BACK TO:</B> "Grand Country"
<P></P>Daria, Darren, Mack, Kevin, Quinn, and Upchuck are standing in a kitchen. 
A "cute" (as Quinn would put it) supervisor is explaining their jobs. he motions 
Quinn to follow him and they both exit through a door. Camera follows them
<P></P><B>Supervisor:</B> Now Quinn, You're gonna have a very important job. 
You'll be here (points to a booth in an enclosed picnic area) distributing ice 
cream.
<P></P><B>Quinn</B> (Shocked) You mean I'll be out in <B>public</B>?! I can't. 
if any of my friends see me in <I>this</I>, I'll...
<P></P><B>Supervisor:</B> (puts a reassuring hand on her shoulder) Don't worry, 
this is a private area. You have to have a special ticket to get in.
<P></P>He opens the freezer in the booth and continues instructing Quinn.
<P></P><B>Supervisor:</B> Now, when people come up, Ask them if they have a...
<P></P><B>CUT TO:</B> inside the kitchen. Daria looks out the window. from her 
POV, we see the supervisor leaving. Almost immediately afterward, a huge line of 
children gather in front of the booth. Quinn has a very happily surprised look 
on her face.
<P></P><B>CUT TO COMMERCIAL</B> Stinger: Darren trying to stuff his backpack in 
a locker
<P></P><B>Scene 9:</B> Still in the Kitchen
<P></P>Daria and Darren are just standing there. Mack comes out of the freezer 
with two large boxes of something. Kevin and Brittany...who knows where they 
are? Upchuck is hitting on one of the female (obviously) employees, who just 
looks at him confused. We hear "Jeremy" by Pearl Jam coming from a radio, which 
one of the internationals turns up full blast.
<P></P><B>Upchuck:</B> And so, my fair maiden, Why don't we have a rendez-vous 
after our shift and break some outdated laws. (growls) 
<P></P><B>Employee:</B> (in a very thick french accent) Why would you want to 
meet me and commit a crime?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (points to Upchuck, speaks to her) Il demande, si tu se 
veux baiser. (he's asking if you want to f*** him)
<P></P>The girl looks at Upchuck, who still has his little grin. She turns back 
to Darren
<P></P><B>Girl:</B> Is it true?
<P></P>Darren nods. The girl glares at Upchuck, then backhands him. he falls to 
the ground
<P></P><B>Upchuck:</B> (weakly) Grr, feisty
<P></P><B>Girl:</B> (to Darren) Thank you
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Pas de problem
<P></P>The girl looks over his shoulder and gets a look of mild fear
<P></P><B>Girl:</B> Uh oh, The...the...(can't translate the word for "boss" 
gives up) Uh...Le patron
<P></P>Darren turns around. A slightly overweight, middle aged manager and a 
security guard come up. The manager pats Darren on the shoulder, and talks to 
him
<P></P><B>Manager:</B> Hey Darren. Listen, We have a policy for the 
internationals. To help them improve their english skills, we have mandated that 
all employees must speak english on the job.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> And what happens if we don't?
<P></P><B>Boss:</B> Well, Normy here (pats the guard on the back) gives you a 
ticket, which says that we take $10 out of your paycheck for every non-english 
word said
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (with a "Let's think through this logically" tone) So, 
your company policy is to punish people who have anything less than a perfect 
command of english, by fining the people who try to help them with something, 
and making them feel more comfortable by speaking their own language?
<P></P><B>Manager:</B> (Kind of gets what he's saying) No, we're trying to help 
them learn English. Full immersion, that sort of thing. (pats him on the 
shoulder again) Capisce?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (sarcastically) Perfectly
<P></P><B>Norm:</B> (hands the manager a ticket) Italian, ten dollars.
<P></P><B>Manager:</B> (To Darren) goo... (turns to Norm) What?!!
<P></P><B>Norm:</B> Capisce, Italian, ten dollars.
<P></P>Darren smirks at the ensuing argument
<P></P><B>Manager:</B> Oh c'mon, that was just a faux pas
<P></P><B>Norm:</B> (Really excited now) Ooh, french. that's another ticket!
<P></P><B>Manager</B> (Really pissed off now) KEEP THIS UP AND YOUR JOB IS 
KAPUT!!
<P></P><B>Norm</B> (unfazed) Ah ah ah, German, German
<P></P><B>Manager:</B> NOW LOOK HERE!!
<P></P><B>Norm:</B> LOOK. YOU TOLD ME TO FINE ALL NON-ENGLISH WORDS. HAVE YOU 
BEEN USING NON-ENGLISH WORDS OR NOT?!!!
<P></P>The manager looks at him, then turns around and stalks off. All of the 
employees are laughing
<P></P><B>Manager:</B> Gah! Merda!
<P></P><B>Norm:</B> (Excited again. Walks after the manager) Ooh ooh ooh, 
Spanish, that's another one.
<P></P>Daria smirks as she watches the two leave. The same supervisor who was 
helping Quinn comes up to Daria.
<P></P><B>Supervisor:</B> You look like you could use something to do.
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> (trying to get out of it) No I don't
<P></P><B>Supervisor:</B> Sure ya do.
<P></P>He takes her over to the deep fryers. They've all been emptied of oil. 
The only thing in it are the (many) burnt food particles that got out of the fry 
baskets.
<P></P><B>Daria</B> Please tell me I don't have to clean these out
<P></P>The manager hands her a spoon and leaves. She stares at it, gets a 
resigned look, and sighs
<P></P><B>Scene 10:</B> The employee cafeteria.
<P></P>Darren, and Mack are standing in a serving line. Darren is looking at a 
throughly unappealing hot dog. He's speaking to a male employee behind the 
counter.
<P></P>Music: "Grab yourself a gun (Theme song to the Sopranos)" by A3 (I think)
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Excuse me, (points to the hot dog) Which animal part was 
that?
<P></P><B>Clerk:</B> Um... (Doesn't really know)
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Just...point to the spot on your own body.
<P></P>Camera stays on Darren, who gets a look of mild nausea
<P></P><B>Clerk:</B> (with a slight German accent) Do you want one?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (takes a salad) Nein. Ich denke, daß ich mich entschlossen 
habe, Vegetarier zu werden. (No, I think I've decided to become a vegetarian)
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> (amazed) How many languages do you speak, anyway?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Fluently? English and ASL. I'm taking french in school, 
and what I just said I got from this really weird book on German slang.
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> Oh. At least you're honest.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (faux dejected) So I'm not going to hell? Damn
<P></P>Mack smirks at this. They both sit down at Daria's table. The cafeteria 
is fairly large and pretty crowded. The walls are adorned with large cardboard 
cutouts of various cartoon characters. There are also several t.v.'s that are 
showing "Dexter's Laboratory" Daria has her head in her hands.
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> (to herself) I've got several small burns from cleaning out 
the friers, My head hurts, I smell like fried chicken, and if I hear any more 
Pearl Jam, I'm gonna kill someone
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Well, it's nice to see you're also having a good day. Look 
on the lighter side. At least Trent isn't here to see you
<P></P>Daria gives him a look of death.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Oh c'mon, Don't think we haven't noticed
<P></P>She just stares at him. then she goes back to her own thoughts.
<P></P><B>Darren</B> But you don't have to get so defensive about it
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> I'm not defensive
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Yes you are. Look, at least you're not working with Kevin 
this time. (to Mack) Speaking of which, where is that little moron anyway?
<P></P>Mack just shrugs
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> How did you know about that?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Jane told me. Think of it this way...
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> At least I can tell when I hate something, rather than 
trying to rationalize it in order to make it seem less degrading than it really 
is
<P></P>Darren lets those words sink in a bit
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Touché amiga. Look, we've endured for four hours. I think 
we can survive another round
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> Don't tell me you've actually bought into that bunk
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (shrugs) it's all I've got left
<P></P><B>Scene 11:</B> Outside the kitchen of hell
<P></P>The group is gathered outside, waiting to be taken to another kitchen to 
work. The main supervisor is leading them along the roads within the employee 
area of the park. They go through a gate and into the park itself. Quinn looks 
in horror at the prospect of being in public in her work uniform. Some unnamed 
characters are wearing their visors backward. A manager pulls them over behind a 
fence. A couple beats later, the kids come out wearing the visor the right way.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> What was that about?
<P></P><B>Kid 1:</B> We were "Out of Costume." as that guy put it
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> You had this (points to the visor) turned the wrong way, 
and you're considered "Out of Costume?"
<P></P><B>Kid 1:</B> Yeah, I guess you could consider this a costume
<P></P><B>Kid 2:</B> What, the clown outfit?
<P></P>The first kid smirks at this.
<P></P>They continue walking. Along the way, they pass the fashion club, who 
have their backs turned to the group. Quinn tries to hide behind Daria, Mack, 
and Kevin.
<P></P><B>Sandi:</B> Like, didn't she say that she was going to be working here 
for today
<P></P><B>Tiffany:</B> (in her typical daze) Something like that
<P></P>Stacy looks and sees Quinn. Stacy gets a look of pity. She looks like 
she's going to tell Sandi, but she stops once she realises what Sandi would 
probably do if she saw Quinn in <I>that.</I> The group continues walking. Along 
the way, they pass the Z-93 van. Bing and the Spatula man are being their normal 
horse's ass selves
<P></P><B>Bing:</B> (Talking about the group) I'll bet that these people know 
how to <I>Par-tay Cray-zay</I>
<P></P><B>Spatula Man:</B> (To Darren) Hey you. Why don't you tell us where at 
work you love to get <I>Cray-zay</I>
<P></P>Darren just looks at them, then he gives them the finger
<P></P><B>Bing:</B> Ooh, I don't think that'll look good on his performance 
review, Spatula Man
<P></P>The supervisor glares at Darren
<P></P><B>Scene 12:</B> The exterior of "The Lone Star Shack," a country-western 
themed restaurant
<P></P>The group walks into a back entrance.
<P></P><B>CUT TO:</B> Inside the kitchen. One of the supervisors is giving out 
jobs. Kevin, Brittany, Quinn, and Mack are bussing tables. Daria and Darren are 
washing dishes. One of the employees turns up the radio, which is playing 
"Evenflow" by Pearl Jam. All the other employees cheer. Daria gets a rather 
annoyed look. The music continues through the following montage:
<P></P>Daria puts a pan through a very large, carwash style dishwasher.
<P></P>Mack is bussing tables. He glares at Quinn, who is flirting with a bunch 
of guys at one table
<P></P>Daria and Darren are both running dishes through. A man in a shirt and 
tie comes up and points to the sink, indicating that they need to pre-rinse them
<P></P>Upchuck is flirting with some ladies. I think you can guess what happens
<P></P>Darren is standing on a counter. literally hosing down a dish. Another 
man in a shirt and tie stops them. We can tell that he's telling them that they 
don't have to prerinse
<P></P>Kevin is looking at the same group of girls that Upchuck was looking at. 
Brittany pulls him over and slaps him.
<P></P>Darren and Daria are doing the dishes again. the first man in the tie 
comes up and points to the sink again. We can tell he's angry. He puts one of 
his hands to his head and falls over backwards. Daria and Darren just look at 
him.
<P></P>Darren is mopping floors. Daria is scrubbing countertops. Mack is putting 
away some dishes.
<P></P>The second man in a tie is filling out Daria's, Darren's, and Mack's time 
sheets. They're all visibly tired. They all exit the kitchen door.
<P></P>Darren comes out of the men's locker room, dressed in his normal clothes. 
He looks at his time sheet, which he should have put in his locker. He gets a 
"Not again!" look as he storms back into the locker room.
<P></P>Daria and Darren are on the bus going home. It's dark out. Daria is 
leaning against the window, sleeping.
<P></P>End Montage
<P></P><B>Scene 13:</B> Outside the Kinsington residence
<P></P>Darren gets out of the car and goes into the house.
<P></P><B>CUT TO:</B> inside the kitchen.
<P></P>Miranda and Mara are sitting at the kitchen table, looking over some 
documents. They look up at Darren
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> (tauntingly) Hey Darren, How was work?
<P></P>Darren gives her a look of death, but he makes an unintelligible grunt. 
He goes upstairs
<P></P><B>Miranda</B> (Slightly concerned, to Mara) Should I ask?
<P></P><B>Mara</B> I wouldn't. I think he'll bitch about his day when he's ready
<P></P>They go back to whatever they were doing
<P></P><B>Scene 14:</B> Inside the Morgandorffer house
<P></P>Daria walks in the door. Jake, who's up, sees her
<P></P><B>Jake</B> Hey kiddo, How was your day?
<P></P>Daria doesn't stop or answer. Instead she walks up the stairs.
<P></P><B>CUT TO:</B> The door outside the upstairs bathroom
<P></P>Daria goes into the bathroom and closes the door. A couple beats later, 
we hear the sound of the shower running.
<P></P><B>Roll Credits</B>

<HR>
<BR><B>THANK THE DEITY, IT'S FINISHED!!!!!</B> This one was almost the death of 
me. Seven rewrites, a <I>lot</I> of changes of ideas, and things like that. And 
it seemed to take forever to write the damn thing once I decided exactly how I 
wanted to do it. And to think, this one is based on actual events. (emphasis on 
"based on" heeheehee) Anyway Here are the
<P></P><B>Endnotes</B>
<P></P><I><U>The Opening Sequence</U></I> Yes, these are teasers for the 
upcoming "season." I got inspired by CN's "The Magical Mystic Spiral Tour" 
series. (Well, not exactly inspired, but I <I>did</I> get the idea for the 
teasers)
<P></P><I><U>James</U></I> Yes, that's me. I was that officer. I had two lines, 
but I got to draw a sword. So it all evened out
<P></P><I><U><B>O'Neill:</B> Well...Ms Li has given us $1000 of the school 
budget for this</I></U> You may think that this is a lot, but you have to 
realise that most plays require at least four to five times this much just to 
break even
<P></P><I><U>Seven Banners Grand Country</U></I> This is based on a local 
amusement park. (Well, it's not exactly "local," but it is within about ten 
miles of where I live) They have a fund raising program where you work for eight 
hours a day and you get about $9.00 an hour. I was a part of this for our 
production of Othello, after which I vowed that I would never work in the food 
service ever again
<P></P><I><U><B>Damien:</B> Oh, I...kind of...got out of that</U></I> The reason 
that I barely included Damien in this was because I figured that the park might 
not really want him. It would be kind of awkward for others if they had to talk 
to him through another person. And knowing his personality like I do, he 
wouldn't be one to fight to be a part of something he would really hate. 
(Confidentially, the real reason was because the other characters were 
complaining about the Kinsingtons getting most of the attention. Damn actors)
<P></P><I><U><B>Darren:</B> WHAT?! (surprised, slightly angry)</U></I> See, The 
Kinsingtons aren't really all that Daria like. Except Darren. (although, for 
those of you who read Canadibrit's fics, he may seem to come off as slightly 
Cullenesque) I'll reveal more on their individual personalities as the series 
progresses. Anyway, to make a long story short (too late) See, Damien and Darren 
are not only Brothers, they're also like best friends. Damien is rather wacky 
when he's on his own. ( For example, if he could hear, and he was in a record 
store that was playing Boy Band music; he would probably grab his throat and 
pretend to choke and collapse, stuff like that) And Darren likes that. So his 
sense of humor is what usually helps Darren get through a really bad (or just 
weird) situation. And I figured that since he (Darren) doesn't have that source 
of humor, he may feel a bit lonely. (God, I'm trying to analyze characters that 
I created)
<P></P><I><U><B>Darren</B>...You do know we're twins, right?</U></I> I got a 
couple e-mails from people asking me if they were twins. There's your answer
<P></P><U><I><B>Darren:</B> Anything you want, he'll get for you within 24 
hours</I></U> The answer to the question of how their uncle gets the stuff is to 
be left to your own imagination, where it's bound to be more outrageous. In 
reality, how he gets it doesn't interest me.
<P></P><U><I>Daria also looks like she's about to throw up</I></U> A reference 
to the episode "Malled." In that episode, Brittany's cheap perfume caused Daria 
to eventually throw up.
<P></P><U><I>Dramamine</I></U> Medication that some people take to combat motion 
sickness, vertigo, that sort of thing. It's an antihistamine, which means it 
doesn't combat motion sickness (which is caused by an imbalance of fluid in the 
middle ear) itself. instead, it makes you too drowsy to notice the dizziness
<P></P><I><U>Eep (or Eap, whatever)</I></U> Some people spell it "Eap" some 
spell it "Eep"
<P></P><I><U><B>Upchuck:</B> I have just the cure, but be careful it doesn't 
cause a fever</U></I> Upchuck said that line in some other fic. I can't remember 
which one, so whoever wrote it: I'm sorry I plagiarized you, please don't sue
<P></P><U><I>An employee...hands him a straight razor and a cup of shaving 
cream</U></I> I had to shave my goatee when I worked there. I didn't cut myself 
(thank god) But I think that if I did, I'd still have to work
<P></P><I><U>The Complete Unified Field Theory</U></I> The unified field theory 
is a physics problem that stumped Einstein (as well as every other physicist 
that has come along) It tries to find a connection between the seemingly 
different forces of Gravity, Magnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. 
(at least that's what I'm told)
<P></P><I><U>Die Broke</U></I> A book by Stephen Pollen and Mark Levine. It's a 
book about managing your money.
<P></P><I><U>The Magic Voice</U></I> And just <I>who</I> was that person talking 
to our heroes? I'll tell you later
<P></P><I><U>How to get Anything on Anybody</U></I> A book by Lee Lapin. It's 
basically an encyclopedia on espionage techniques and technology. If you want to 
know what it says about auto tailing, <A 
href="http://www.anarchyrules.com/departments/anarchy/misc/autotail.txt">Click 
here</A>
<P></P><I><U>The international's fondness for Pearl Jam</U></I> I worked in a 
kitchen that was made mostly made up of internationals. they seemed to have a 
fondness for Pearl Jam. As much as I like Pearl Jam, it really got annoying 
after about four hours
<P></P><I><U>Quinn's first duty</U></I> That was my first job. It only got worse
<P></P><I><U>The english fine</U></I> It's based on a cartoon I saw in my french 
class one day. No real reason for my inclusion of it, other than the fact that I 
thought it was funny
<P></P><I><U>Daria cleaning out the friers (sp?)</U></I> That was my second job, 
Yuck
<P></P><I><U><B>Darren:</B> What I just said I got from this really weird book 
on German slang</U></I> That book, incidently, is called "Wicked German for the 
Traveler" It's really funny, even if you don't speak German. There's also a 
version in Japanese, French, Italian, Spanish, and Irish Gaelic
<P></P><I><U>The Kids who were "Out of Costume"</U></I> that happened to a 
couple of kids. and yes, the management did refer to our uniforms as costumes
<P></P><I><U>Bing and the Spatula Man</U></I> Two rather annoying radio D.J.'s 
from the episode "Jake of Hearts"
<P></P><I><U>The Montage near the end</U></I> Everything that happened to Daria 
and Darren happened to me. (except for the guy passing out, dammit)
<P></P><I><U>Daria goes into the bathroom and closes the door...shower 
running</U></I> This was the first thing I did when I got home from that hell
<P></P>Finally, there was a small error in the footnotes of "Casting Call" I 
stated that the name of one of Damien's dogs came from the third book of the six 
book "Hitchhikers Trilogy" As someone pointed out, there are only five books. 
Sorry
<P></P>Well, as I've said before, this thing was rather difficult to write. 
(Jeez, now I have to start all over again for the next one) It is for this 
reason that I hope you enjoy it. As usual, you know where to send your comments, 
criticisms, flames, rants, virii, and birthday presents (July 12, if anyone 
cares)
