<b>WHY YOU SHOULD NEVER HIRE BRITTANY TAYLOR</b><br>
<br>
<br>
(The time: December of 2006. The place: Cashman's gift box section. Sandi approaches the gift wrapping desk, manned by Brittany Taylor.)<br>
<br>
Brittany: Like, can I help you?<br>
<br>
Sandi: Like, I want seven gift boxes to wrap presents in for, like, my family.<br>
<br>
Brittany: Gift, huh?<br>
<br>
Sandi: Right. I want seven of them, one large, three medium, and three small.<br>
<br>
Brittany: OK, one medium, three large and three small.<br>
<br>
Sandi (sounding testy): No, no, one large, three medium and three small....<br>
<br>
Brittany: OK, seven gift boxes, three small, three medium and one large--er, how do you spell gift box?<br>
<br>
Sandi (sighing in frustration): G-I-F-T, B-O-X.<br>
<br>
(Brittany picks up a pen and a notepad and writes down on it.)<br>
<br>
Brittany: OK, G-I-F-T, B-O-S........<br>
<br>
Sandi (frustrated): X, X, B-O-X!!<br>
<br>
Brittany: Sounds like a new cheer. (Jumps up, doing her splits and her Lawndale High cheerleader routiine) X, X, B-O-X!! X, X, B-O-X!! GOOOOOOOOOOOOO, BOX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
(Sandi is livid--up to the point of grabbing Brittany by her blazer and sticking her red face in the cheerleader's.)<br>
<br>
Sandi: Just give me my gift boxes before I stick a rocket in your out of style blazer and aim you towards Russia!! GRRRR!!<br>
<br>
Brittany: OK, OK, you got your boxes, hang on!!<br>
<br>
(Sandi lets go of Brittany, who consults her note pad.)<br>
<br>
Brittany: Seven gift boxes, one large, three medium and three small...... gift box...... G-I-F-T, B-O-X.... uh, how do you make a B?<br>
