Disclaimer:
        All Daria characters are trademark and copyright of MTV
networks.  Blah, blah, blah.  This story was based on what I think
should happen to Daria.  If anybody has a problem with that you can
just go kill yourself, cause I am not changing my ways (please don't kill 
yourself for real, that's just sad if you do, I'll cry).

Summary:
In my story Daria is forced to get a job by her parents, fortunately
for Daria, Trent gets a job too only they are working at very
different places.   Daria then finds out Trent has another girl.  UH OH!!!

Scene one:
Takes place in Daria's room.  Outside it's sunny and the skies are
blue.  Daria is inside of course.  It is during summer vacation and
Daria is bored out of her skull.  In the background the song "I will
wait" by Hootie and the Blowfish is playing.

Knock on the door

Daria:          (DEADPAN) who goes there?

Helen:          Daria, don't you think that you should be-

Daria:          Hold it right there mom, is this another one of your
speeches that involves me going out and doing something, cause if it
is you will be-

Helen:          Daria, that is exactly right, your father and I have
been thinking.

Daria:          Hey, hold on a minute, Dad...Thinking?

Helen:          OK it was my idea.

Daria:          Was that so hard to admit?

Helen:          I know that school is out and you haven't been very
active lately, so I thought that you could go out and get a job.

Daria:          You know that I won't work in your Kathy Lee
sweatshop down in the basement.

Helen:          You are going to work for my friend, his name is
Jonathan, and you will work at the movie theater.  He's already agreed.

Daria:          But I haven't even accepted yet!

Helen:          There are no buts Daria, (sounding angry) JUST DO IT.


Scene 2

Over at Jane's house in her bedroom.  Jane is painting a picture of a
vase with four dead roses in it.  Daria is looking through of Jane's
CD's and complaining.

Daria:          I just can't believe it, I have to start tomorrow.

Jane:           It's too bad you don't work at the Pizza Hut, cause
that's where Trent is working now.

Daria :         Hold on a sec, did you just say that Trent got a job?

Jane:           I sure did.

Daria:          That's amazing, how is it interfering with his
sleeping schedule?

Jane:           It's really cutting into him.

KNOCK ON DOOR

Jane goes to the door and opens it then Trent falls over face first
onto Jane's floor.

Jane:           See what I mean.  (helps Trent up)

Daria:          I heard the news Trent.  How you holding up.

Trent:  (squints his eyes to see who said that) Oh, hi Daria  (Looks
more awake and active)  They have me working six hours a day at a
Pizza Hut.

Jane:           Yeah, so that must be why you actually smell good for
a change.

Daria:          So what exactly do you do at Pizza Hut?

Trent:          I'm delivering pizzas.

Daria:          Well at least you don't have to give overpriced popcorn and 
candy to people.

Jane:           Daria has to work at the movie theater.

Trent:          Fun Daria, too bad that we couldn't both work at the movie 
place, we would be able to see each other.

Daria:          Remind me again why you got a job?

Trent:          I am saving up for a new amplifier.  The other one blew up 
when Jesse had it on full blast.

Jane:           Speaking of Jesse.. (Jane looks out her window and
sees the Tank pulling into the driveway.)

Trent:          Gotta go.

Jane:           Where?

Trent:          Over to Jesse's, we're gunna practice.

Daria:          Or sleep.

Trent:          (Laugh/cough) Yeah, or sleep.


Scene 3:
At Daria's house.  In her room.  Daria is alone and watching
Friends,  (NOT, think about it, would our loyal Daria watch that
show?  She is watching Sick Sad World duh!!

TV:             They say that they are computer geniuses but are they
really just downloading cartoon pornography??  Next on SICK SAD WORLD!

Daria:          OK that just kinda freaks me out.  (turns off the TV)

Helen:          (knocks on the door)  Daria! You're going to be late
for your first day of work!

Daria:          Uh oh, I better get ready then.  (stays still,
sitting on her bed)

Helen:          (comes inside her room) Daria, Jonathan wants you to
work there.

Daria:          Has he even met me?

Helen:          Daria,  I will give you the keys to my car and you
can drive.

Daria:          Oh, now you're thinking that if I have a job then if
I crash the car I can pay for it right?

Helen:          (Frustrated)  Daria...


Scene 4
Movie theater, Daria is behind the candy counter and getting a bag of
Skittles (which by the way are a whopping $2.25)  for a man with no
teeth.

Daria:          That will be $7.50, (the man has popcorn too) (Just
then Daria looks over to the theater entrance only to see that Trent
is there, WITH ANOTHER GIRL!!!! GASP)

(Trent and his lady walk up to the counter.)

Trent:          Hello Daria, we would like a medium popcorn and two  small 
Cokes.

Girl:           Diet for me, and no ice.

Daria:          OK hold on a minute. (Daria turns around and begins
to fill a bag with popcorn.  Her eyes are getting somewhat watery.
She holds back from crying though.  She then fills up the cups with
the coke and diet coke, no ice.)  There you go that will be. (types
everything into the register.)  eight dollars and twenty-seven cents.

Trent:          (Gives Daria a ten-dollar bill and Daria makes change for 
it.)  So is this your first day?

Daria:          Actually no, it's my second.

Trent:          You do this like a professional, (realized the stupid 
comment he just made) I guess.

Daria:          Thanks.

Girl:           Come on Trent, we're going to be late!  I love seeing
the previews.

Trent:          All right, come on.

Daria:         (turns to the cashier standing next to her)  Brad, I am going 
to take my break now.

Brad:           Sure thing, Daria.

(Daria then runs out of the theater and goes into her mother's car)

Scene 5
(Daria rushes into the house and is heading up the stairs when Helen
stops her)

Helen:          Daria!, Jonathan said that you left work ear-(noticed
Daria's red eyes and tears) Oh, Daria.  What happened?

Daria:          Nothing!  Nothing happened.

Scene 6
In Daria's room.  Daria is lying on her bed her eyes now dry.  She
looks deep in thought.

(Daria sits up and picks up the phone.)

Daria:          (dials Jane's number and waits for answer)

Trent:           Hello?....(silence)...... um hello?

Daria:          (realizes that she needs to say something)  Oh, um
hi, this is Daria.

Trent:          (sounds very tired) Daria.  Hey.

Daria:          Um is Jane there?

Trent:  No, actually she just left with Jesse.  They were going to
the theater to see you.  I guess that they didn't know that you got
off work.

Daria:          OK thanks. Bye.

Trent:          Bye.

(Trent hangs up the phone then falls asleep)
(Daria hangs up the phone and looks like she is going to cry but then
regains her composure.)

Helen:          (knocks on the door)  Daria!  Daria I know that you
are in there and I think that we need to talk.

Daria:          OK mom, come on in.

Helen:          (shocked that Daria is willing to talk to her)  Well
Daria, why did you leave work early today?

Daria:          Well because I was afraid that if I stayed there any
longer I would have to kill myself.

Helen:          OK,(doesn't believe Daria) why were you crying?

Daria:          I wasn't crying.

Helen:          You weren't?

Daria:          No, I wasn't.

Helen:          Then why were your eyes red.

Daria:          (Looks panicked for an answer) Well I um… squirted
butter in my eye (THINKING: where the hell did that come from?!?!?!)

Helen:          (Looks suspicious but then realized that Daria
doesn't want to talk)  OK, I understand.

Daria:          (Looks at the door then looks at Helen)(THINKING:
maybe if I punch her in the stomach I could have just enough time to
get out of here before she starts saying "when I was your-)

Helen:          You know Daria

Daria:          (THINKING: here it comes)

Helen:          When I was your age and something happened to me at
work-

Daria:          I know, I know, you wouldn't have let it affect you
and you would continue working

Helen:          (says jokingly) Well actually I would mess up 'till I
was eventually fired.

Daria:          So you want me to get fired?

Helen:          (realizes that Daria though that didn't think that
what she said what a joke.)  What I mean is, I would think of
something else that made me happy.

Daria:          You want me to do that?

Helen:          Well yes.

Daria:          You're talking to me here.  What possibly could make me 
happy?

Helen:          Think of the opposite thing that makes you sad.

Daria:          (Thinks for a minute then smiles)  (THINKING:  I will
just thinks of what life was like before Trent started dating someone)

Daria picture the two of them frollocking through a meadow.  Daria
then pushes that picture out of her mind.  She then thinks of when
Trent hugged her and was happy to know that she was OK in "Daria!"
(the musical.)


Scene 7
Jane and Jesse at the Movie theater.  The movie just got out.

Jesse:           Where was Daria?

Jane:            (looks around the concession stand to try and find her.) I 
don't know.  Probably found some guy.

Jesse:  Are we talking about the same Daria?


Scene 8:
Jane is in her bedroom.  She just got dropped off by Jesse who has
left to go home and study the geometric patterns of the German snail
collection he has had since the second grade.  (That is what he does
to go to sleep instead of counting sheep, pretty cool huh?)  Anyway
it is about 4:30 (Jane and Jesse went to an early movie)  Jane is
curious to why Daria wasn't at the movie theater.

Jane picks up phone and calls up Daria.

Jake:           Hello?!?!?  Hello?!?!?!? You aren't going to hang up
are you?!?!?!?

Jane:           Ummmm.. is Daria there?

Jake:           Yeah hold on.  (covers up the phone)  DARIA!! PHONE!!

(cut to Daria who is inside her room)

Daria:          Jane?

Jane:           Yeah, how'd ya guess it was me.

Daria:          Well, you are the only one who ever calls me, but other than 
that, I have psychic abilities beyond your mortal comprehension.

Jane:           Jesse and I went to see a movie today.

Daria:          Well then your not the only one.

Jane:           What are you talking about?  You sound a little out
of it.

Daria:          Jane do you know who Trent was with today?

Jane:           What do you mean?  A girl?

Daria:          Yeah, he came to the movies with some girl.

Jane:           Really?  OK, I don't know.  I am speechless.

Daria:          Well that's a first.  Do you think that that is his
girlfriend or something?

Jane:           Do you want me to check on it?? I will spy for you.

Daria:          Oh come on Jane..... (thinks it over and wants to find
out who the girl was) yeah, do it.

Jane:           Call you back.  Bye!

Jane then goes outside her room and down the hall to Trent's room.
The door is open just a touch so she can spy.  She noticed Trent
picking up the phone.

Jane:           (THINKING: who is he calling? Probably his girlfriend)
(with her phone still in her hand she pushes the on button and
listens in on the conversation.)

Trent:          Jesse, yeah, I don't think that it worked.  What do you 
mean?

(Spit screen of Jesse and Trent)

Jesse:          Well did you bring my cousin.

Trent:          Yeah, I brough your cousin.

Jane:           (THINKING: cousin?!?!?!?)

Trent:          But she looked like she was going to cry and it isn't too 
often you'd see that when you look at Daria.

Jesse:           That's good that means that it was working and now you can 
ask her out.  That must mean that she likes you.

Trent:           Daria is probably mad at me.

Jesse:           Come on.  I have heard this girl.  She is so in love with 
you.  Now you have the proof.  Ask her out puh-leeze! If you don't
then Jane and I are going to have to kill you.

Trent:           No.  She doesn't like me, she was probably just having an 
allergic reaction to the popcorn salt or something.

Jane:           (cutting in) JUST ASK HER OUT!!!  DO THIS OR I WILL
TORTURE YOU IN YOUR SLEEP!

Trent:  (surprised look)  JANE!  What are you doing!?!?!?!?!

Jane:           Well, I had to find out who you went to the movies
with and this was the only way.

Trent:  You couldn't have just asked?

Jane:           Well that would have been easier.  But this was much
more fun.

(at that moment they hear a knock at the door)

Jane:           I'll get it!!

Jane opens the door only to find that Daria is there.  It is amazing
how fast Daria can run isn't it?

Jane:           (in a really cheerful voice)  OH cool! You're hear!

Daria:          Yeah, I know it's amazing that I come her under such
times.

Jane:           Hold on, just one second.  (Jane runs upstairs and
gets Trent.)

Trent:          Who is it?

Jane:           Just come downstairs, call Jesse back later!

(cut to Jane pulling Trent downstairs by his arm)

Trent:          (Looks over at Daria and then turns away immediately)  So... 
what brings you here.

Daria:          (looks at Jane in disbelief of what she just did.)
(doesn't want Trent to know that she wanted Jane to spy on him)  I
called Jane and I told her to do something then she said she was
going to do that and then I was going to call her back because I
didn't want her to do it.  But then the phone line was busy and then
I came over here.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.

Jane:           Trent, don't you have to tell Daria a secret?

Trent:          No (runs upstairs but Jane grabs his leg and he trips)

Daria:          Maybe I should come back some other time.  (Daria
moves over to the front door and is about to leave)

Trent:          NO!  Don't go.

Daria:          (obeys his "command" and turns back into the house)
why?

Trent:           Because I have to tell you that the girl that you saw me 
with at the theater wasn't my girlfriend.

Daria:          (Brightens up) She wasn't?

Trent:          No, she is Jesse's cousin.  I only went to the movies with 
her because I wanted to see you and make you (looks as though he
doesn't want to say the word) jealous.

Daria:          OK, why?

Trent:         (gets up from the stairs and walks towards her he then put 
his hands on her shoulders.) I love you, Daria.

Daria:          (smiles) I love you too, Trent!

Trent then kisses her and then they go to the movies.

The End
