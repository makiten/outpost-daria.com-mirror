costume!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"It's a little over the top,
Viola," Angelina Fosh said, taking in the sight of the girl in the skin-tight
black bodysuit and red cloak as she strode past the two women, and the man who
stood with them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Viola Fosh snickered at her
older sister, before taking a moment to take in the setting inside the
gymnasium-sized conference room (now redecorated and re-arranged for a
celebration) of the Lawndale, Maryland branch of <i>Wolfram and Hart.</i><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"You just wish you were bold enough to wear
something like that," she countered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Angelina grunted out a sound
of annoyance. "She wears the tramp look too well &ndash; but then, look at who her
mother is!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The petite, pale-skinned
blonde in the shepardess outfit whacked her fianc&eacute; on the back of his
blond-tressed head. "See something you like?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Rand McBain nearly choked on
his slice of pumpkin-rum cake as he realized his fianc&eacute; &ndash; and her little sister
&ndash; were watching him as he watched the shapely rump of "Just thinking that
Little Red Riding Hood comes from one hell of a tough neighborhood."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Sure you were," the Fosh
sisters said in unison &ndash; something Rand knew that he was going to simply learn
to live with, considering how close the two sisters were, even though they were
a full decade apart in age. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Rand brushed cake crumbs from
his 'Solid Gold Dancers' costume. "Besides, I like 'Little Bo Peep' a lot
more." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>The blonde broke their kiss as she saw a face in the crowd. "Hey -
isn't <u>that</u> 'Der Boss and Company'?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Yes, it is," a familiar voice
said from just behind him. "Enjoying the party, everyone?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Wishing inwardly the world
would end at just that moment, Rand turned around to see Helen Barksdale-Lane
standing behind them, looking spectacular in the <i>I Dream of Jeannie </i>'harem
girl outfit she was almost wearing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"For future reference, Rand,"
she said distracting all three from the sight of her ample breasts all but
spilling from her top, "If you can't find a girl who's got the sense to check
around her before she makes disparaging comments about the Senior
Partner-in-Residence &ndash; <i>the person who decides your future here</i> &ndash; you
might have a problem at my sister's firm."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Rand nodded silently as Helen
reached out to take the hand of a blond-haired man in a World War II Army Air
Corps dress uniform. "Come on, Wind. Let's go say hello to Erin and the twins."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Viola Fosh &ndash; a vibrant, busty
girl of nineteen with waist-long onyx hair, eyes that matched her hair, and
pale, yet flawless skin; all coming together to accent her own Mogana Le Fay
costume &ndash; smiled as a trio of guys in vampire makeup and Armani evening suits
walked past, unable to keep from looking back at her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Man, the people who work here
have excellent makeup artists!" she said, watching as a second trio walked
past, unable to keep from noticing the thin necklace around her pale neck &ndash; a
necklace studded with a number of eye-catching jewels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"I'd say that you've done
equally well with your skills as a gemsmith," a second familiar voice said, as
Amy Morgendorffer &ndash; the Senior Partner-in Residence of the firm &ndash; walked up to
her. "I love your necklace &ndash; especially the gemstones you used, and the way you
set them... it's as if it were specifically crafted to ward off evil and amplify
good energies."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>There was a moment of tense
silence; Amy went "Boo!", making the older Fosh sister and her fianc&eacute; jump.
"Gotcha. Rand &ndash; Angelina. So glad that you could make the party."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Amy turned back to look at
Viola with the expression of a cat toying with a particularly dangerous Norway
rat. <i>"And your little sister, too,</i>" she continued.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Wouldn't have missed it,"
Viola said; at six feet even, she was the tallest person in the conversation,
and towered over even her brother-in-law to-be by a good five inches. "Gets me
out of a GE algebra test that I really don't want to take just yet."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Oh, I remember those horrid
'general education' courses &ndash; <i><u>hated 'em</u>," </i>Amy concurred. "Still,
I'm glad for the grind &ndash; helped out worlds when I went to law school."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Viola noticed how the level of
tension radiating from both Rand and Angelica seemed to dissipate as the smile
Amy directed at her widened. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>Why don't you all come with me?" Amy continued, guiding Viola
towards the front of the room. "I think that you're going to enjoy this year's
special addition to the annual Halloween party's events &ndash; and this year, I
promise that there will be <u>no</u> human blood sacrifices, ritual summoning,
or raising of the dead."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Angelica hung back, touching
Rand's arm so that he dropped back as well. "Was &ndash; she was just kidding,
right?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Ang &ndash; remember when you asked
how a guy two years out of law school could be working a major law firm and
making a mid-six figure salary?" Rand said, making sure that no one was in
earshot before speaking. "You'll find out everything soon enough &ndash; but for now,
accept that <i>there are things about my job that you just don't need or want
to know about for now."</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Okay," the woman relented, noticing
that Amy was waving them forward. "Let's see what your Dread Leader wants."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Oh &ndash; one more thing," he
said. "You should stop doing that &ndash; snarking on people who work here - unless
or until Miss Barksdale says it's okay."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The serious tone in Rand's
voice chilled Angelica's blood as she followed him to where Amy, Viola and the
young woman (who looked eerily like Amy - now that she got a good look at her,
Angelica thought).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Good evening, everyone!" Amy
spoke, her voice somehow seeming more powerful as it carried easily to even the
back of the room. "Fellow partners, associates, employees, clients and guests &ndash;
welcome to the annual <i>Wolfram and Hart</i> Halloween celebration!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The conference room (the Fosh
sisters noted) held a lot of people who wore some of the best monster costumes
they'd very seen. <i>Oh, well,</i> both sisters thought, almost as one. <i>With
al of the super-rich and famous people they work for all over the East Coast,
they'd have the money and contacts to get costumes this good.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Viola tuned back in to Amy's
words as a chill went through her &ndash; and she noticed the girl from earlier
watching her, as if curious, but unsure about her identity, or reason for being
here...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Tonight, we will forgo
several of the usual party activities, and welcome a special guest!" Amy called
out, waving forward the girl in the bodysuit. "I present to you &ndash; <i><u>Judith</u>!"<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Ohhhh," Angelina breathed
out, as she leaned in towards Rand. "So, that's not her daughter Daria?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Rand shrugged. "I never
thought that Daria would be seen, at an occasion like this, in something so,
well, <i>ordinary."</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Judith stepped forward, her
malicious smile making her seem even more alluring than before. "Thank you,
Amy," she said. "Shall we begin-?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Tendrils of dark energy
reached out from the sphere of dark energy that Judith conjured with a slight
gesture, and with shrieks and screams of agony and rage tearing through the
air, all of the monsters and demonic creatures- </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i>They're real!</i> Angelica
realized, her heart starting to beat wildly as she saw a werewolf shifting back
and forth in the air directly above her, snapping at her face as the tendril of
energy brought him just over her head. <i>Oh, God, these monsters are <u>real</u>!</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The sounds of the creatures
disappeared as they vanished &ndash; and the air of the room was filled with a
collective gasp as a single dark beam drew down from the hovering sphere to a
point barely an inch above the floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>As everyone watched, the beam
began to flow outward like thick tar until it became a circle four feet across.
"My thanks to the <i>Senior Partners</i>," Judith said. "With your help, and
the sacrifices they provided, your universe will live."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>She stepped forward; Judith's
eyes flared, and the <i>annihilation sphere</i> flared with red streaks from
within before it dropped through the eldritch portal. "Goodbye, universe of <i>Glorificus."</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Judith turned to Amy, a look
of absolute hatred flooding across her visage. "And now, for all of <i>you</i>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>A second sphere, the red
streaks burning through the darkness within, appeared over Judith's outstretched
left hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"You lied to us," Amy hissed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"No, I didn't," Judith
countered. "I said that your universe would <i><u>live</u></i>. I never said
for <i><u>how long</u></i> &ndash; and considering that you look exactly like that
Green-Jacketed Bitch &ndash; I never planned for that to be <i><u>very</u></i> long.
Goodbye-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>An aura of blue energy
appeared around Judith's construct &ndash; a second flash cut through the air barely
a blink of an eye afterward &ndash; and she spat out a single word with undiluted
anger as the sphere froze in mid-air! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"<i><u>What</u></i>-<i>!"</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Judith shrieked &ndash; her screams
lost among the mass of other cries of terror &ndash; as the area erupted in panicked
terror! "You <u>BITCH</u>-!" she screamed, as a blue circle of solid light
appeared in the air and a roaring light and sound. "How are you &ndash; you <u>can't</u>
&ndash; <i>I'll <u>get</u> you, Amy-!"</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Rand (who had dropped to the
floor to protect Angelina by covering her with his own body) lifted his head to
see Viola &ndash; now, the only person still standing in the room. "What the hell was

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Viola 's face held a sheepish
expression as she looked down at her family, over to a rising Amy, and then,
glanced about the room at the people who were rising from places of hiding to
gape at her. "I, well, I guess there's something that I need to tell you about,
Angie..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i>"I should say so!"</i> the
blonde said, wriggling out from under her fianc&eacute; &ndash; and then, hugging her sister
tight before holding Viola's hand up to reveal the simple silver ring that she
wore on her right hand. "Did you just save us from that &ndash; person &ndash; <i>and <u>is
THAT what I think it is</u>?"</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"I'd say that she did," Amy
cut in, smiling as she rose to her feet. "All that, and more... now, do you
understand why I asked that you make sure to bring your fianc&eacute; and her sister
to the party?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The expression of approval on
Amy's face for the members of her family didn't even begin to smooth over the
wave of anger that began to wash over the absolute terror from just moments
earlier. "Viola, how did you do &ndash; whatever it was you did, and <i><u>you</u>-!"</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Rand stepped away from his
fianc&eacute;, worried (and with good reason, the thought) that she might bash him
over the head with her shepard's crook. "Why the hell is it that you seem to
know how Vi did whatever it was that she did? Is <u>that</u> one of those <i><u>Rings</u></i>
they talk about on the news? Why didn't you ever tell Nana or me about it &ndash;
that necklace of yours isn't just really good costume jewelry, is it? You made
that at school with <i>real jewels</i> that you made with that Ring!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>As Amy stepped between the
young couple and helped to calm a slightly hysterical Angelica, Viola stepped
over to a dessert table, keenly aware that while the guests maintained a

left leg-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>As she looked at her exposed
leg, Viola could see how she was suddenly blushing all the way down to her -
because the slit in her Morgana Le Fay costume (already a bit higher than she
was comfortable with, and certainly never something she would wear in the light
of day) had torn to reveal so much more leg and thigh than she had ever wanted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"If you want, you can have my
cloak," the voice of a young man spoke from just behind, and Viola turned &ndash; and
looked up! &ndash; to see a tall, broad-shouldered young man with carrot-red hair and
a perfect smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i>Among <u>several </u>perfect
things he has,</i> a little voice inside her spoke very loudly, as Viola
momentarily forgot her embarrassment &ndash; until the young man finished snapping
the robe's fasteners around her neck, allowing it to flow over her like a
dress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Thank you," she said, looking

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"The least I could do for the
heroine of the hour." There was a moment of awkwardness &ndash; something that, Viola
could sense, was quite unusual from him. "I'm Finn Morgendorffer. Mom and Aunt
Amy said that you're Mr. Mcbain's sister-in-law."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"In a couple of months," Viola
replied, almost gushing &ndash; before remembering what Valkyrie has once said to her
and the always-in-trouble Courtney (though, being honest, it really wasn't her

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"About six months ago," she
said; the relief at being effectively 'outed' (<i>although using the Ring in
public in <u>here</u>, of all places, means that it'll probably <u>never</u>
get reported in the mainstream news,</i> she thought) helping to ease the
tension from her 'wardrobe malfunction'. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i>Of course, the sexy green

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The smile on Finn's face
widened as he accepted the flute of sparkling punch Viola offered him. "About
ten seconds after I told them that I wasn't going as a 'sandworm' &ndash; even if I
got to be the front section. How did you know that I wasn't one of the
Musketeers?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Because you're talking to
me," Viola replied, stopping for a moment to sip from her own flute of punch,
"while your entourage is hanging back in awe of you talking casually to the
girl who just did something unusual."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>As Finn and Viola talked,
Helen made her way though the crowd to Amy &ndash; who had just left Rand to finish
the job of calming his fianc&eacute; down. "She'll be all right with this," Amy said.
"He'd never have gotten involved with her if she wasn't tough enough to deal."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Amy glanced over to where
Helen has motioned, to see Viola and Finn close as they chatted. "Inform the
Senior Partners that our deal with the Ringmasters has been completed," she
said. "The time-control facet of their minion's Rings is effective against both
Judith and her means of destroying universes &ndash; and that Judith is currently
unaware that she is vulnerable to that aspect of their weapons."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"As well as the Ring's
capacity to banish extra-planar entities," Helen cut in. "The <i>Ringmasters</i>
built better than they knew-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Or than we <i>imagined</i>,"
Amy finished her sentence for her. "Those things can also banish active energy
sources of extra-dimensional origin &ndash; even those sources infinitely more
powerful than the Rings themselves. I think that we just learned something
about the Ringmasters that they didn't want known."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Helen's eyes narrowed. "What's
that?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"All of the universes that
have been destroyed by Judith? They could have stopped it all," Amy said,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The Senior
Partner-in-Residence turned back to her sister. "There's only one reason," she
said. "They wanted those realities to die... <i>or they <u>needed</u> them to be
destroyed.</i> Why? What are the Ringmasters planning?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Amy turned back to her sister.
"Simple. They needed something &ndash; or someone &ndash; as powerful as the forces backing
Wolfram and Hart to appear as if we had interfered with her plan. They needed
something else to occupy Judith's attention while they carried out whatever it
was they needed to do."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Amy reached out to touch her
