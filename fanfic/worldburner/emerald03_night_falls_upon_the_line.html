<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Having just returned to his
workstation after a critical mission, the Hyperspace Supervisor known as
Richard swung around to face the worried &ndash; no, <i>frightened</i> - face on his
desktop monitor. <i>"Tracking multiple entry vectors into near-lunar orbit,
just beyond the outer defense grid!"</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Richard's eyes narrowed. <i>This

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Sir &ndash; we're picking up IFF
beacons &ndash; <i>Corps of Ringbearers</i> vehicles," a second, calmer female voice
cut in. "Over one hundred vehicles have appeared in real-space in the last
ninety seconds. We're tracking RSV's, fifty-eight <i>Mobile Advance Bases</i>,
and two <i>Sky Vaults</i>. "</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>His fingers flying over his
keyboard, Richard brought up a satellite feed &ndash; and sat back as he watched the
image of a trio of <i>Mobile Advance Bases</i> reverting to real-space.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style="mso-spacerun:

voice said. "One of the <i>Sky Vaults</i> &ndash; <i>Sierra Victor Five,</i> the <i>Saleesa</i>
- has suffered severe damage to her upper hemisphere &ndash; northwestern sectors.
The 'slipstream vessels' appear fully operational &ndash; hold. Another <i>Sky Vault</i>
has entered real-space. She's broadcasting &ndash; Sir, that's a new code; we are
listing her IFF as <i>Sierra Victor <u>Seven</u>."</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Somehow, Richard suppressed
the surprise that sprang up within him. "A <u>seventh</u> <i>Sky Vault</i>?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i>Oh, Archangel</i>, he
thought, as he watched several of the saucer-shaped 'slipstream vessels' pass
over one of the moon-sized <i>Sky Vaults. If you happen to survive, you and I
are going to have a nice little discussion about the concept of <u>disclosure</u>.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Hello, Richard."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Richard looked up at the
stunning thirty-something woman, who spoke to him from one of the many
stairwells around the command deck. "Do I know you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Not yet &ndash; but you will," she
said. "I understand that you may recognize me &ndash; at least, my temporal
counterpart for this reality &ndash; Rita Barksdale," the woman continued. "I'm Rita
Conroy &ndash; acting Commander of this station."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"A pleasure to meet you,"
Richard replied. "Now &ndash; would you kindly explain why you've jumped a fleet into
an area of space clearly designated as Agency jurisdiction without prior
warning? With all of us on war footing, we were almost ready to fire upon you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Before you and the rest of
the Agency start getting upset about our crashing on your couch for a few
days," she said, starting down the stairs,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Be advised that we have <i>a much greater problem</i> to deal with. We
jumped here because we know that in Agency space, we have a chance to regroup
and effect repairs without being fired on." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Richard was prepared to have a
great deal to say &ndash; until he glanced around the massive command deck of the
heretofore-unseen <u>seventh</u> <i>Sky Vault</i> &ndash; and could almost feel the
somber atmosphere. "Permission to come aboard, Commander."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The woman &ndash; like most of those
on the command deck, dressed in what appeared to be a sturdier version of a
flight suit, colored in the blue hue preferred by the <i>Corps</i> - came to a
halt in front of Richard. "Permission granted, Supervisor," Rita replied.
"Welcome aboard the <i>Sky Vault <u>Avalon</u>."</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>*****</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Nova Valdris is <i>gone</i>,"
Rita said, as the door of her office closed behind her, Richard, and the buxom
young blonde that followed at Rita's heels - a blonde who wore the blue
fatigues that had become <i>de rigueur</i> for <i>'Ringbearers of the Line'</i>.
"Earth-designate 'D-247' &ndash; and the rest of that universe - has been<i>
destroyed."</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Richard looked at her, unsure
what to say as Rita waved him to a chair in front of the large desk that
dominated the room. "Judith sent her pet bitch <i>NegaJane</i> in," Rita said,
sitting down behind a desk as the blonde stood just behind Rita &ndash; as if she
were her bodyguard. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i>Interesting, </i>Richard
thought, instantly identifying the young woman in her late teens. <i>She got
herself a Brittany Taylor, and trained her for personal security. Not a bad
choice.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Brittany disappeared from
Richard's view as Rita began to speak once more. "Instead of doing 'death from
above' the way they usually do it - dropping those annihilation spheres that
apparently, both of them can create to wipe out a universe - she decided to
send a very personal message to the <i>Legion</i>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The name rang a bell for the <i>Agency</i>
supervisor. "Those kids on D-247 &ndash; the metahuman youth group?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Richard remembered a brief
from three years earlier, when the Legion had formed on five known Earths. <i>They're
not considered a relevant factor on D-415, and Jake Mackenzie wiped out the
Legion of D-1155 &ndash; along with his entire family, including the Mack and Daria
Mackenzie of that reality - before becoming a <u>Ringwraith</u>.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>On D-1111, they're too busy helping their world rebuild after the <u>Daylight
Crisis</u></i>. <i>On D-742, that gender-swapped version's got their own
internal problems because of the member they call <u>Phantasm</u> <u>-</u> and
even on D-247, they're not supposed to be a major factor on the world for at
least another <u>year</u>. Why hit them <u>now</u>?<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Yes." Rita said, a pang of
loss and anger going through her as she thought of the dead. <i>Even though
they weren't my family, it still hurts.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Her eyes flicked over to a mounted
portrait on the wall &ndash; and the image of a Daria in her early teens, smiling as
she hugged her brother and younger sisters. <i>Helen, Jake, Darren, Quinn and
little Veronica all died on that camping trip soon after they moved to
Maryland, and poor Daria... at least Texas barbequed that bastard Todd - and
those two idiots that helped him &ndash; for kidnapping, gang-raping and leaving her
to die slowly, on what was supposed to be her first day of high school. <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i>It's the reason why I don't
qualify for a <u>Defender Ring</u> and they wouldn't give me powers &ndash; but I
enjoyed watching all three of those bastards strapped into that chair as they
roasted. I'm so glad that on my world, they <u>never</u> got rid of </i><u>burning
at the stake</u><i>.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"From what our source
reported, Judith dropped in on D-247 <i>at least</i> <u>four</u> times before
hand, during her satanic scavenger hunt," Rita continued. "Even though that
damned prophecy says that she was to always get what she was searching for, she
apparently got frustrated somehow in her search there."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Richard accepted the glass of <i>nectar</i>
that Brittany offered him; he enjoyed the cool taste of tart, freshly made
lemonade as the liquid touched him lips, and transformed into the drink he
wanted. "She didn't get to kill the Daria of that Earth," he said, after drinking
deep. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"She didn't get to kill her,
was humiliated in the process and took it personally," Rita told him. "Not
taking out the Daria of a reality seems to be something she looks forward to.
To get back at the Legion... she came up with <i>something special</i>. You know
how she's working with allies?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The memory of watching
Archangel's <i><u>Agency</u></i>-liaison report on <i>Apocalypse's</i> return
was vivid in Richard's mind as he spoke. "We know."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Rita placed her hand on a
touch-pad on the desk, and a hologram of the Earth appeared above them. "Well,
she's got another one &ndash; someone with serious inter-dimensional transport
ability. Whoever these new allies or hers are &ndash; and we think that it's your old
friends from the AGI - they had a transport gate on-planet."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Richard remained silent, his
expression darkening as Rita continued. "What made things <u>bad</u>," she
said, "was that they were able to somehow use that gate to link into <i>every
single transport system</i> <i>on the planet</i>&ndash; artificially-made <u>or</u>
naturally occurring &ndash; and send tens of thousands of those flame-doppelgangers
of Judith through <i><u>simultaneously</u></i>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Richard nodded.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I've just returned from a mission that
confirmed that the AGI are on the move and can also take control of
communication and data networks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've
barely started on preparing a report.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>&quot;Thank you for that
update.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>&quot;Even worse, we've
learned that their suggestion capacity is far greater than previously
known.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They can compel almost any
action from someone who has traveled through a Gate." Richard glanced over to Brittany.
"Therefore, anyone who has ever traveled through a gate is suspect.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Rita and Brittany shared a
look that Richard couldn't decipher. &quot;Noted.&quot; Rita told him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>&quot;But I'll warn you that
if the AGI are working with Judith, it is to their ends and not hers," Richard
said, returning his attention to Rita. "They've already conquered
D-571...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>&quot;Good riddance to
that,&quot; Rita said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Richard said, &quot;And at
least a couple dozen more realities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
the interest of full disclosure, I must tell you that Daria Von Doom escaped
and is currently working with us against the AGI.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The holographics shifted; the
image zoomed in and locked on a fast-food franchise of average appearance, and a
targeting reticule appeared over a dumpster with the words 'Good Time' inked in
large red text across the front. "The gateway is &ndash; was &ndash; behind that trash

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"You're not wrong." Richard's

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Where the Daria and Jane Lane
of that reality usually have their first meeting, if it's meant to be, almost
always happens in that area," Rita finished for him, remembering the bright,

developing an interest with Darren that seemed to be mutual &ndash; and who died with
them on that camping trip.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"That area is such an

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Not anymore," Brittany spoke,
her first words since they entered the room. "Before she jumped out of the
'D-247' universe, our <i>Whisperer</i> confirmed that a number of cadets from
the U.S. Government's metahuman training academy &ndash; cadets with Theta and
Omega-level mental powers, so they were able to block the AGI's mind-control
effects - sacrificed themselves to blow the Gateway, and stop further

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Richard looked over at the
blonde, and swiftly revised his perceptions of her as she continued. "At the
same time that happened, every Gateway that the Corps is aware of in the <i>Local
Group &ndash; every single one, on every planet in every galaxy within - </i>was
either totally destroyed or rendered useless."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"All <i>we</i> know is that

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Oh, and we would <i>really

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"&ndash; and Judith was <u>not
amused</u> about whatever happened," Brittany said, again ignoring the look
Rita gave her. "We think that someone <u>did</u> take NegaJane's head, because
that's when <i>the Dark Mistress of Skank </i>herself decided to make an
appearance... and finish the job <i>personally."</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Brittany paused, and took a
moment to regain her composure. "She dropped <i>three</i> of those spheres
right down onto Legion Tower itself," she finished. "We were barely able to get
the Twin Worlds through crossover before we lost the universe."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"She must have someone else

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Rita filled a shot glass with
nectar, and slammed it back before speaking, "The majority of the Fleet made it
out with the other <i>Sky Vaults</i> as soon as the evac message went out from
the <i>Saleesa</i>," she said<i>. </i>"<i>No one</i> made it off Nova Valdris.
The annihilation sphere that hit <u>them</u> was configured for a primary blast
radius similar to a <i>Nega Bomb</i> &ndash; basically, <i>an area roughly one-tenth

Brittany nodded in agreement<i>. </i>"If they hadn't sent the signal as they
jumped &ndash; thank you, God, for <i><u>emergency temporal shifts</u></i> - we'd all
be dead. The bulk of the Fleet jumped to the D-1111 universe with <i>New Sierra

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Brittany looked at Richard &ndash;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"New Sierra is the world where

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>A hologram appeared in the air
as Brittany held up her right hand. "With Nova Valdris gone, we transferred the
flag to New Sierra and used the <i>Sky Vaults</i> to move them into their new
positions in orbit around Eta Cassiopeia," she spoke, taking on an air of
command as the hologram displayed the star, the newly-placed twin worlds, and
the many space vehicles within the system over their heads. "The <i>Tesla</i>
and the <i>Masada</i> are remaining on station to fortify our defenses there.
We brought the <i>Saleesa</i> here so we could begin repairs; the <i

she looked back at Richard. "Over the past twelve hours, Judith's forces have
begin specifically targeting every reality where the <i>Corps</i> has a major
command-and-control facility that strategic operations can be led from," she
said. "Every reality where any discipline or form of technology exists that can
specifically harm her has either seen those worlds where that threat exists

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Rita sat ramrod-straight in
her chair as Brittany continued to speak. "She has destroyed our homes, our
worlds, and the very realities that we once knew as home," she told Richard.
"Because of her and her allies, untold numbers of innocents have been put to
the sword. She has killed our leaders, and has sealed a pact beyond our
comprehension in order to destroy all that exists. The darkest of nights has
fallen over existence, but as of now <i>&ndash; <u>it ends</u>."<o:p></o:p></i></p>
