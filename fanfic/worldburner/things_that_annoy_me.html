<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>-Christmas shopping annoys me.
People who go out of their way to wear Christmas and holiday-themed outfits
with red, white and green colors annoy me. People who are dicks throughout the
year but become nice from the day after Thanksgiving to December 26th annoy me.
People who are nice all throughout the year and go from Thanksgiving to Boxing
Day spreading Type 2 diabetes wherever they go with their mere presence really
annoy me. Basically, if you are human and rabidly celebrating the holidays in
my line of sight, you probably annoy me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>- Children who climb on top of
you and recline upon you as if you're a throw rug annoy me. Hey, kid - what
makes you think that I like you, and if you somehow have that misinterpretation
of 'you bug me, go away' to mean 'come and sit with me, and show me that you're
a wonderful kid', you're wrong, so go away before I toss for distance and make
a you-shaped hole in the far wall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>- Those stupid twisty
energy-saving light bulbs annoy me. 'Oh, look at me with my fancy, special
shape that says 'I'm trying way too hard to be cool as I save the consumers a
few pennies off their energy bill in a laughably futile effort to reduce energy
across the world.' Yeah, good luck with that, because you annoy me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Smoked turkey for holiday
dinner annoys me. You're supposed to bake the effing turkey, and have the smell
of the bird's dead flesh making wonderful smells as it burns slowly in a hoot
over so that when we eat it, we won't die immediately from sickness - just
years or decades later from a host of other diseases caused by bad eating
habits which include eating turkey, and yes - that annoys me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Everybody and his brother
doing stupid holiday specials. If I wanted to experience the true spirit of
Christmas, I'd get a shotgun, a camera that takes Kirlian photographs, blow
away the first damn Santa Claus impersonator I come across and take a picture
as he dies, with his ghost goes wandering away, bewailing his misspent life -
and that would also annoy me, because if you're going to be a ghost, at least
do something interesting with it, like go scare the caribou fudge out of Sarah
Palin in the middle of one of her Twitter sessions - and oh, you better believe
that both the Half-Governor and 'Twit-er' annoy me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Falling asleep in the dumbest
of places annoys me. Ever been sitting on a chair of stool, fall asleep because
life or the idiots you're with are too damn annoying to be allowed to live, but
annoying laws that say 'no, you can't shoot them and use them as the fertilizer
for next years' vegetable garden'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>are
in place, so you sit there, fall asleep and almost fall off like the proverbial
parrot that has ceased to be? This annoys me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>People who take the corner
pieces of any baked goods when they come over to your house to eat or have
snacks. Listen, scrotum-hoodie, the middle pieces are your punishment for not
fixing your own dinner at your own house. Accept it, eat your damned dinner and
leave the corner pieces alone because it annoys me when you don't.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Radio stations that usually
play kick-ass music eleven months out of the year but get their panties twisted
into a Christmas bow over the holidays annoy me. I don't want to hear
back-to-front, head-to-toe, crotch-to-cranium versions of my favorite holiday
selections, because you're not really caring what I want to hear, you're
playing what the addled-by-snow-and-mythic-beings aspect of the holiday season
instead of playing the songs I turned to your damned station to hear, and not
being able to hear my songs instead of that holiday air pollution annoys me
because I don't ever plan to see Rudolph's nose, I don't care that it glows,
and really, if I ever saw him, I'd sight in on him with a .30-06 scoped
Winchester, put one squarely through his left eye and have reindeer brisket for
my Christmas<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>dinner because while fictional
mutant reindeer and their struggles to fit into a society that hates and fears
them annoys me, the fact that Rudolph didn't fly off to visit Professor Charkes
Xavier and get help to control his mutant powers annoys me even more BUT the
thought of fresh, delicious venison for dinner does not annoy me at all. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Mistletoe annoys me. Listen,
folks - if you have to have a special herb hanging over your heads to kiss
someone, why not just go whole hog and bang them underneath the Christmas tree?
That would not annoy me, because for a lot of people, that would be The
Greatest Gift of All.</p>
