<br>
<br>
A fic in the <u>Worldburner</u> shared-world series, by Brother Grimace</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>&quot;The designer of the gun had clearly not been instructed to beat about
the bush. 'Make it evil,' he'd been told. 'Make it totally clear that this gun
has a right end and a wrong end. Make it totally clear to anyone standing at
the wrong end that things are going badly for them. If that means sticking all
sort of spikes and prongs and blackened bits all over it then so be it. This is
not a gun for hanging over the fireplace or sticking in the umbrella stand, it
is a gun for going out and making people miserable with.'&quot;<br>
<br>
- a description of the '<u>Kill-O-Zap</u>' gun, from The Increasingly Misnamed
'<u>Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy</u>' Trilogy.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It was a motley group of over one hundred men and women that had gathered in
the dank, drafty tunnel &ndash; a tunnel fully two hundred feet from floor to
ceiling, over a quarter-mile wide and fully two miles long, situated over a
mile beneath the flat, endless terrain of Southern Illinois. <br>
<br>
Military personnel in worn fatigues and fresh uniforms, civilians in various
forms of dress, people of all ages, several with missing limbs and visible
scarring... they all watched from their various spots in the abandoned
underground fallout shelter as the group of five persons in the jet-black
combat uniforms of <i>DELPHI</i> paramilitary troopers continued to open the
large crates that made up a half-circle around and behind him<br>
<br>
To a person, the resistance forces that had gathered for the meeting to plan against
the invasion of Judith's forces all seemed worn and weary in spirit - until the
man standing before them reached down into one of the crates.<br>
<br>
"Ladies and gentlemen - this is <i>the Armalite PFT-JK-11 concussive-force
energy weapon</i> - our own personal design," the man said, holding up a
rifle-style weapon with a non-reflective, black-matte finish that screamed
'military issue' to those present in uniform. "She's designed for one thing &ndash; <i>to
kill every unholy bastard that's fool enough to put itself in your sights."</i><br>
<br>
It seemed as if a breath of fresh air blew through the tunnel as the man the
Resistance members knew simply as 'the Armorer' stepped forward; every person
seemed less animated as their eyes remained locked on the weapon in his hands.<br>
<br>
"She can fire single pulses &ndash; as fast as the user depresses the trigger
mechanism &ndash; in three- and ten-pulse bursts, or you can go fully automatic," he
said, walking over to a trio of British SAS commandos, who stared at the weapon
as if they were being re-acquainted with a long-lost friend. "Each weapon is
issued with three insert power cells &ndash; one thousand pulses each. You're
operating with a <i>conditionally unlimited ammo supply</i> &ndash; provided that you
don't go crazy with the 'rock-and-roll'."<br>
<br>
One of the Englishmen stood and spoke, his voice crisp as he took a step
forward. "These modified blasters of yours will stop the flame-figures?" he
asked, looking the weapon over. "Are you sure?"<br>
<br>
"We're sure," the Armorer spoke up. "Also, they're not modified &ndash; it's a new
design. I could go into detail, but we don't want you folks to get bored with
all the talk about 'how the gun can do this and how it can do that'." <br>
<br>
He flashed a smile at them as he flipped a switch, and a distinctive sound,
like a low-pitched, synthesized animal growl, cut through the air as the weapon
charged. "You can read the Tom Clancy-style tech manual later," he continued.
"Right now, we'll go with 'show, not tell'. Much more fun for the kids at
home."<br>
<br>
The Armorer took a flat, circular disk about the size of a manhole cover from
one of the crates. "The JK-11 fires energy pulses capable of causing the
equivalent of hydrostatic shock in energy-based life-forms," he said, handing
the weapon to the SAS commando. "Do you mind-?"<br>
<br>
"Do <u>you</u> mind NOT using technobabble?" an attractive Latina with
incredibly long legs hissed from the back of the crowd. "Some of us don't
understand it, and the rest just think you're showing off!"<br>
<br>
"I could stand to hear a bit more," the commando said, looking the weapon over.
"<b>Later.</b> May I?"<br>
<br>
The Armorer smiled as he tossed the disk like a Frisbee away from the group; it
landed about forty yards away &ndash; and as he turned back, held up a small remote.
"By all means."<br>
<br>
A unified gasp of alarm rose up from the gathered resistance fighters as the
Armorer pushed a button on the remote in his hand - and a feminine-shaped
figure of flame that they all recognized instantly erupted from the disk!<br>
<br>
In one fluid motion, the Englishman turned, sighted in on the flame-Judith that
had appeared &ndash; and the figure of flame exploded in a brilliant splash that
dissolved just as fast as it had appeared, leaving only a few flickers to die
out on the floor around the disk.<br>
<br>
"Nice shooting, kid," the Armorer said with admiration, noting how the trio of
three energy pulses erupted from the weapon and punched through the spot where
the 'heart' would be.<br>
<br>
"Father Christmas has been making new toys," the commando smiled, as he looked
his new weapon over. "After Judith's little holiday special, I guess he decided
that the good little boys and girls deserved something <u>very</u> nice this
year."<br>
<br>
Nodding as he turned away, the Armorer focused his attention back on the
slightly stunned group of resistance fighters. As he took a step forward, he
noticed how the military personnel within the group had eager, almost feral
expressions as they all imagined what they could do with the new weapon...<br>
<br>
"In plain English," he said, glancing in the Latina's direction, "It means that
we created 'tumbling bullets'... <i>in <u>energy form</u>."</i><br>
<br>
"<i><u>Very</u></i> nice," a ferret-faced U.S. Army major with medical insignia
observed. "They literally tear the flame-forms apart &ndash; and do it so fast that
when they go, they can't take anyone with 'em."<br>
<br>
The SAS commando cradled the weapon as he would a first-born child. "Very nice,
indeed," he repeated. "I'll be keeping this beauty." <br>
<br>
"Take her and be welcome,&quot; the Armorer responded. &quot;Besides the
disruption-effect, we've added another setting when creating this version of
the PFT... if I may, just for a moment?"<br>
<br>
The commando relinquished the weapon, and the Armorer turned to a spot about
five hundred meters from the gathering, where several crate-sized steel ingots
were neatly stacked before the meeting. "For your consideration," he said,
handing the weapon off to one of his associates, who sighted in on the ingots. <i>"'<u>Slayer
mode'</u>."</i><br>
<br>
A sound like a crack of thunder rang out, making everyone wince; seconds later,
the smoke cleared from the general area of the steel ingots, and even the SAS
commandos winced as they saw how all but three of the ingots had been shattered
into rubble... <br>
<br>
Two of the remaining three ingots were poking out of the ceiling of the fallout
shelter, one hanging precariously, as if ready to fall at any moment... and the
third seemed to have simply disappeared, leaving a conspicuously rubble-free
area within the rubble. <br>
<br>
The Armorer motioned for his associate to return the JK-11 to the commando. "In
'Slayer mode', the JK-11 also discharges a simultaneous one-quarter second
release of <i>'black sunlight'</i> ... a form of anti-energy that will instantly
destroy any normal matter it comes into contact with."<br>
<br>
The hand of a twenty-something man of obvious Scandinavian ancestry (pale and
handsome, even with the long, thin red scar that went down the left side of his
face from scalp to chin that missed his eye by barely a quarter of an inch.)
retracted from the air as his smile widened. "What about the metahumans
Judith's been sending in &ndash; can this stop them?" <br>
<br>
The Armorer waved the Scandinavian forward; moments later, he was looking over
his own JK-11. <br>
<br>
"When fired in 'Slayer mode', the JK-11 <i><u>will</u></i> kill or critically
injure <u>any</u> being it fires upon," the Armorer told him, "up to and
including any <i>Class Five</i> metahumans you come across. Even if you can't
end the bastard, he's going to remember that you knocked him on his ass and
made him <i><u>bleed</u>."</i><br>
<br>
"Lovely," the SAS commando said, caressing the JK-11 with a single finger as he
stood off to the side. "I my actually have to reconsider my relationship with
my service rifle, if this lovely lady is going to be a part of my life."<br>
<br>
"Before you marry it &ndash; <i>be advised,</i>" the Armorer informed the assembled
gathering, even though his eyes were on the SAS commando. "'Slayer mode'
consumes a massive amount of your weapon's power reserve. With the insert power
cell, you have <i><u>three</u></i> pulses in this setting."<br>
<br>
He turned around, and let his eyes move slowly over the men and women in the
area. "With the internal reserve &ndash; you get <i><u>one</u></i>. Use this setting
sparingly, people. The stress 'Slayer mode' puts on the cells can degrade their
lifespan if used constantly."<br>
<br>
There was a slight chorus of sound and heads nodding as the Armorer motioned to
the commando. "One thing, though... step this way."<br>
<br>
The SAS commando walked in step with the Armorer back to the open crates, and
watched as he pulled a device that looked like a palm-print scanner into view.
"Judith has a habit of appropriating tech and weapons," the Armorer said,
addressing everyone in the area. "I think that you can understand why we'd
rather not have her get her hands on a JK-11 &ndash; so we've designed a
countermeasure for if she tries to do just that, of if some of your
garden-variety bad guys or raiders try to grab a weapon. Sergeant &ndash; would you
mind putting your left hand on this scanner?"<br>
<br>
Obliging, the commando did as he was told; moments later, the Armorer looked
up. "It's a 'signature weapon?' he asked, watching as his buddies and several
others drew close. <br>
<br>
"Oh, yes," was the response. "Judith puts off a very specific energy signature,
which this weapon can detect. They're designed to explode if Judith or NegaJane
tries to fire one of them - same thing with any meta that isn't in the
system.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Armorer gave the commando an evil smile. &quot;With your normal thieving
human bastards - it'll just discharge an omnidirectional pulse - one foot, at
max power. Someone will need to get a bottle of bleach and a mop."<br>
<br>
"What if that crazy woman takes one from somebody, and tries to beat them like
some sorry-ass backwoods punk getting his skinny, worthless ass beat for
sniffing around your daughter?" <br>
<br>
The Armorer couldn't help but smile as a plump, fifty-something woman with the
remnants of sunburn on her face and bare forearms stepped up to the crate. <br>
<br>
"She's a psycho bitch that loves just hurting folk," the woman said, her West
Virginia accent thickening as she spoke. "You saw what she did to that Spanish
girl during her crazy Christmas special &ndash; what's to say she won't start just
smashing heads in with a person's own guns?"<br>
<br>
"Tammy, please," a short, slender woman spoke up from her seat. "This is a bit
more important than-"<br>
<br>
The plump woman's head snapped around &ndash; far faster than the Armorer, or anyone
else present, would have imagined. "And what happens when that lightning-wench
of hers that looks like a photo negative comes fluttering back and forth all
around West Virginia, looking for those girls she says are supposed to be
around the church? You saw what she did to Deacon Bates!"<br>
<br>
The young woman sitting next to the slender woman (<i>another relative and
probably a daughter or niece &ndash; they look like family,</i> the Armorer thought,
as he glanced at the attractive, six-foot plus brunette with the long legs)
shook her head. "Aunt Mary, Aunt Tammy &ndash; are you going to do this in front of
the people we're supposed to be getting help from?"<br>
<br>
"Wait," the Armorer said, giving the girl another look &ndash; and getting a searing
glance from 'Aunt Tammy' in the process for his trouble. "You're from the East
Coast resistance group &ndash; you come out of <i>Carthage, West Virginia?"</i><br>
<br>
"Yes," the young woman said. "How'd you know that, mister?"<br>
<br>
The Armorer shook his head. "What's your name, miss?"<br>
<br>
The young woman stood up. "Martina Peters, sir."<br>
<br>
The SAS commando and 'Aunt Tammy' gave the Armorer a strange look as he took a
long, slow breath that rumbled with disbelief. "Let me guess... just after the
nuke war you guys had with North Korea that took out Washington, Pittsburgh and
Philadelphia, a couple of guys came through? One of them needing medical care
for a dog attack - that one was a short guy with red or auburn hair &ndash; and the
other one was a bit taller and slender... black hair, blue eyes, had a thing
for art, really good hand with a gun?"<br>
<br>
The fallout shelter was silent. "Now you're just scaring us, mate," the
commando said, "even with all of this 'Judith' and 'other dimensions' thing
going."<br>
<br>
A hungry glint appeared in the eyes of the Armorer. "Martina...you said that <i>'NegaJane'</i>
keeps coming back around the area?"<br>
<br>
"Last time she came through, she fried up Pastor Jones with her lightning after
she said he was looking down her shirt...&quot;<br>
<br>
The girl shuddered, and the slender woman next to her drew her back to her seat
before standing to speak. &quot;She said that if we don't cough up this 'Jane
Lane' girl, she'd burn the area down around the rest of us in town," she said.
"I'm Mary Peters. I ran the Maryland Resistance - until Judith came to finish
up what the North Koreans started.&quot;<br>
<br>
She put her hand on Martina's shoulder. &quot;That's why I made my baby girl
come with us to this meeting... so I could keep watch on her. <i>NegaJane</i> saw
her, and said that Judith would be... <i>interested</i> in her.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lost in thought, the Armorer began to pace slowly as the military and
resistance fighters watched him. "This is interesting," he said, almost to
himself. "Very... interesting."<br>
<br>
He turned about to face the resistance fighters. "All right, then," he spoke
up. "Let's get this started. Form up to be issued weapons and receive biometric
clearance. Robertson &ndash; you're in charge. I need to take care of something. Miss
Peters - I'll need to speak to you and your people after the meeting."<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Minutes later, as the other <i>DELPHI</i> operatives began to dispense the
JK-11 weapons, the Armorer went to a small alcove that his people had set up
earlier for privacy. <br>
<br>
He looked about the area, and then, pulled at the silver necklace he wore about
his neck until the silver ring on the necklace was visible. <br>
<br>
<i>"Flash message &ndash; secure link to Warhammer Avalon-One,"</i> he said, as the <i>Defender
Ring</i> on his chain gave off a slight flash of blue light that resolved into
a one-foot-tall, full-body hologram of Brittany Taylor as she sat behind a
desk. "Hello, Commander."<br>
<br>
Brittany didn't waste time. "Report."<br>
<br>
"The unified resistance forced are going to be happy with the JK-11's we're
supplying them," the Armorer said. "They believe that we're with another
AU-variant of <i>DELPHI</i>."<br>
<br>
"As long as they keep Judith and her friends busy for a few more moments, I
don't care if they think we're the <i>Riverbottom Nightmare Band,</i>" the
Commander of the <i>Sky Vault <u>Avalon</u>'s</i> Warhammer cadre (and at
present, the frontline commander of the war against Judith) hissed at the <i>Whisperer</i>
Ringbearer. "Supply them with as many weapons as they feel they need."<br>
<br>
"I have other news, as well," the Armorer said. "I believe that an opportunity
may exist here for us to launch <i>Project Amiga.</i>" <br>
<br>
The animal glee in her tone came easily through the Ring-link.
"Time-sensitive?"<br>
<br>
The Armorer nodded in response. "I believe so," he said. "How soon can you be
ready to deploy?"<br>
<br>
"Report back within twelve hours," Brittany told him. "Do not under any
circumstances reveal that your team is composed of <i>Ringbearers</i>. If you
are discovered, do memory modification on everyone involved - and if you
encounter the <i>Order</i> or any of Judith's forces, use the <i>Mallory Lock</i>
you've been issued to slide to an alternate Earth. Portal to a safe location
from there."<br>
<br>
The Armorer nodded once more. "Yes, Commander."<br>
<br>
Brittany sat back, a look of smug satisfaction on her face. "If this works,
this could end the war... because if <i>Project Amiga</i> works, we <u>will</u>
put an end to Judith &ndash; <i>once and for all."</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<b>END</b></p>
