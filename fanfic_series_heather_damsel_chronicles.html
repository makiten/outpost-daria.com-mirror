<tr><td><font size=2 face="Arial"><a href="http://www.nightgoblyn.com/h101.htm" target="_blank">Welcome to Lawndale</a> (*)<br><br>The Morgendorffers move from NYC to Lawndale, into a mansion in the Crewe Neck community specially designed by Fashionable House Realty, Inc. After moving, the family goes out for pizza.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><font size=2 face="Arial"><a href="http://www.nightgoblyn.com/h102.htm" target="_blank">Cherry Bomb</a> (*)<br><br>First day of high school: Damsel joins a clique and Heather meets a new friend... and the Flying Monkeys. Quinn takes the girls out to dinner so Daria can have some personal time with a certain someone.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><font size=2 face="Arial"><a href="http://www.nightgoblyn.com/h103.htm" target="_blank">Memory Lane</a> (*)<br><br>Once again finding themselves victimized by their parents' busy work schedules, the twins get shuffled off to stay at Cherry's for the evening. While there, Uncle Trent takes them on a guided tour down memory lane... but not all questions are answered.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><font size=2 face="Arial"><a href="http://www.nightgoblyn.com/h104.htm" target="_blank">Laugh, Clown, Laugh</a> (*)<br><br>Turning away from Heather for a moment, here is the story of Damsel's introduction to the Renaissance Society and the wild world of Lawndale High. Much to her sorrow, some equations turn out to be harder to solve than others.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><font size=2 face="Arial"><a href="http://www.nightgoblyn.com/h105.htm" target="_blank">Pair Shaped</a> (*)<br><br>With the Homecoming game and dance right around the corner, a young high schooler's fancy turns lightly to thoughts of love. In some cases, replace "love" with extreme irritation, angst and pining, or a crisis of confidence.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><font size=2 face="Arial"><a href="http://www.nightgoblyn.com/h106.htm" target="_blank">Sub Vino, Sub Rosa</a> (*)<br><br>The ancient Romans believed that things done in drunken revelry should stay secret... sort of an ancient 'What happens in Rome, stays in Rome' philosophy. In the post modern era, our heroines must decide which is worse: shopping for the dance, the dance, or the honesty that comes from the vine.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><font size=2 face="Arial"><a href="http://www.nightgoblyn.com/h107.htm" target="_blank">Powers Trip</a> (*)<br><br>Cherry Lane attempts to track down her elusive quarry through the jungles of Lawndale High and accidentally gets a deeper look at the Morgendorffer Madness than she wanted. All this while dealing with the backdrop of madcap movie madness.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><font size=2 face="Arial"><a href="http://www.nightgoblyn.com/h108.htm" target="_blank">Haunted</a> (*)<br><br>It's Halloween in Lawndale, time for all the ghosts and spectres to rear their ugly little heads and cavort in public. Plus, there's a cool costume party at the Zon... to which Cherry and Damsel conspire to drag Heather by hook or by crook.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><font size=2 face="Arial"><a href="http://www.nightgoblyn.com/h109.htm" target="_blank">Snow Place Like Home</a> (*)<br><br>A freak blizzard blows into Lawndale and the twins are missing. Their family braves the storm to find them, and discovers that there are more storms brewing than the one outside.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><font size=2 face="Arial"><a href="http://www.nightgoblyn.com/h110.htm" target="_blank">Bitter Harvest</a> (*)<br><br>It's Thanksgiving Day, a lovely time for families to come together and share a meal and the warmth of family togetherness. This can't end well.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><font size=2 face="Arial"><a href="http://www.nightgoblyn.com/h111.htm" target="_blank">Clique, Clique Boom</a> (*)<br><br>Damsel's rival Jessica spins a web of half-truths and lies in an attempt to claw her way to the top of the social ladder. Meanwhile, Jane and Heather are confronted by an angry Daria, who has discovered that they are concealing something from her.</font></td></tr>

Old friendships change, new friends are made, and the unstable Morgendorffer home life gets shakier.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><font size=2 face="Arial"><a href="http://www.nightgoblyn.com/q002.htm" target="_blank">Quinndy Lou Who</a> (*)<br><br>It's nearly Christmas, but times look bleak for the Morgendorffer sisters: both have been practically abandoned by their family and they must struggle to survive. Daria has a plan to put an end to the Barksdale feud once and for all, but it may be too little too late as far as Quinn is concerned.</font></td></tr>
