She's a high school brain who had a crush on him but could never tell him she loved him. What drove them to run off to Las Vegas together to get married? Find out on the next "Sick, Sad World," or just read this story.</font></td></tr>

Could it be that Lola has always been smart -- or has Trent been using hypnosis and mind-altering drugs on her? Brainwashing, on the next "Sick, Sad World."</font></td></tr>

They had it all, and yet two years ago, they abandoned their life of fame and fortune and disappeared from public life. What were they thinking, and what has happened to them? The horrifying truth, on the next Sick, Sad World!</font></td></tr>
