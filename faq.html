      <font size=3><b>1. What is <i>Daria</i>?</b></font><br>
      <br>
      <i>Daria</i> is an animated TV sitcom that chronicles the adventures of Daria Morgendorffer, a cynical and sarcastic loner at Lawndale High School. Most episodes revolved mainly around how she dealt with the absurdities of life, her relationship with her family (lawyer mom Helen, business consultant father Jake, and ultra-popular younger sister Quinn), and her friendship with Jane Lane, a fellow outcast and an aspiring artist.<br>

      <br>
      The show ran for five seasons on the MTV cable network, from 1997 to 2001. Each season contained 13 episodes (generally running in staggered fashion from late February to early August), for a total of 65 episodes. There were also two TV movies produced, <i>Is It Fall Yet?</i> and <i>Is It College Yet?,</i> the latter serving as the series finale.<br>

      <br>
      At this time, no episodes are known to be airing in the United States. (Nickelodeon's teen-oriented channel, The N [now known as TeenNick], was showing episodes from 2002 to 2006, though these versions were usually badly hacked up to remove objectionable content, and some episodes were never shown at all.) Information on episodes airing outside the United States was formerly available from Martin Sylvester's The Irony Maiden, but sadly, that site has folded, and no other source of information is currently known to be available.<br>

      <br>
      She's a familiar face to almost anyone who's ever watched MTV's <i>Beavis and Butt-head.</i> Daria was an occasional guest character on that series, a classmate of the Demented Duo who was alternately amused and exasperated by their brain-dead antics. When <i>Beavis and Butt-head</i> ended, series writer Glenn Eichler pitched to MTV the idea of making Daria the star of her own series. He shifted the action from Highland, Texas, to the middle-class town of Lawndale, altered the premise (one cynical teenager versus the world), and fleshed out her character. MTV gave the go-ahead, and as they say, the rest is history.<br>

      <font size=3><b>6. Is the series available on VHS video?</b></font><br>
      <br>
      Only three videos were released in the United States:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Daria,</i> consisting of episodes 1-3 of season one ("Esteemsters," "The Invitation," and "College Bored") and the unaired black-and-white pilot ("Sealed With a Kick")
        <li><i>Daria Disenfranchised,</i> consisting of episodes 4-7 of season one ("Cafe Disaffecto," "Malled," "This Year's Model," and "The Lab Brat")
        <li>The movie <i>Is It Fall Yet?</i>
      </ul>
      <p align="justify">
      On all of these videos, generic music replaced the original music soundtrack, likely due to the high cost of obtaining video distribution rights for the original music.<br>

      <font size=3><b>7. How about DVD? Perhaps one of those boxed sets that seem to be so popular?</b></font><br>
      <br>
      There have been only two <i>Daria</i> DVDs released in the United States, for the movies <i>Is It Fall Yet?</i> and <i>Is It College Yet?</i>. Both DVDs contained extras and bonus episodes. Sadly, while the <i>IIFY</i> DVD featured the complete, uncut movie, the <i>IICY</i> DVD included the edited-for-time version. Neither DVD contained the original music soundtrack, again likely due to the high cost of obtaining video distribution rights for the original music.<br>
      <br>
      For the longest time, <i>Daria</i> episodes on DVD (aside from the ones included as bonus material on the two movie DVDs) seemed unlikely to happen, with low consumer demand (as evidenced by weak sales of the movie DVDs) cited as the most common reason. Recent developments, however, have given hope to the possibility that grassroots efforts by the fans have finally awakened the sleeping MTV giant. According to series creator Glenn Eichler, there is serious activity on the part of MTV towards putting the series out on DVD in some fashion. Check the <a href="news.html">News</a> page for developments on this front.<br>

      <br>
      <i>Is It Fall Yet?</i> was the only time, and featured:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Carson Daly</b>, host of MTV's <i>Total Request Live</i>, was the voice of David Sorensen, Quinn's tutor and unrequited love interest.
        <li>Musician <b>David Grohl</b>, guitarist for the rock bands Nirvana and Foo Fighters, was the voice of Daniel Dotson, the visiting artist who was a legend in his own mind.
        <li>Musician <b>Bif Naked</b> was the voice of Alison, Jane's art colony friend who wanted to get a little <i>too</i> friendly.
      </ul>
      <p align="justify">
      Several of the regular voice artists, however, are notable in their own right:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Tracy Grandstaff</b> ("Daria") was one of the original seven participants in the "dry run" test pilot for MTV's <i>The Real World</i>.
        <li><b>Wendy Hoopes</b> ("Jane," "Quinn," "Helen") had a bit part in the Howard Stern flick <i>Private Parts</i>, appeared in an episode of NBC's <i>Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</i>, and co-starred on the NBC series <i>LAX</i>.
        <li><b>Alvaro J. Gonzalez</b> ("Trent") and <b>Russell Hankin</b> ("Tom Sloane") are successful off-Broadway theater artists.
        <li><b>Sarah Drew</b> ("Stacy") went straight from college to a role in the Cuba Gooding Jr. film <i>Radio</i>, an appearance in an episode of Fox's <i>Wonderfalls</i>, and a recurring role on the WB series <i>Everwood</i>.

      <br>
      Quite a few, in fact. Here are only some of them:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Though not nearly as many as during the height of the show's popularity, lots of <b>websites</b> (such as this one) still exist that cater to many different aspects of <i>Daria</i> fandom, including fan-produced stories ("fanfic") and artwork.
        <li>Web-based <b>message boards</b> are a popular means of communication, allowing you to exchange messages with other fans on a variety of topics.
        <li>If you have a news reader and access to a Usenet news server, the <b>alt.tv.daria</b> newsgroup will also allow you to get in touch with other fans (though there's not much traffic there these days, with many fans apparently preferring web-based message boards).
