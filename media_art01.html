<b>Lynn Minton Reports: Fresh Voices<br>
Daria Quips: An in-depth interview with TV's brainy and proudly unpopular teen</b><br>
<p><i>Daria Morgendorffer, the 16-year-old title character in MTV's new animated series, "Daria" - a "Beavis and Butt-head" spin-off - is out of place both in her own home (her younger sister, Quinn, is a supercute airhead the boys adore, her parents are stressed-out and clueless) and at her suburban school, where she walks around looking scornful in lace-up boots and black-rimmed glasses. What is Daria really like? We decide to risk a few questions:</i><br>
<p><b>Lynn Minton:</b> What qualities does a teenager need in today's world?
<p><b>Daria:</b> A positive attitude and a desire to achieve. And unlimited wealth, politically connected parents, a battalion of lawyers and a secret airstrip high in the mountains.
<p><b>LM:</b> Which are the awkward years?
<p><b>Daria:</b> So far, all of them.
<p><b>LM:</b> What do you admire most about your parents?
<p><b>Daria:</b> Well, they keep coming back night after night. I give them credit for that.
<p><b>LM:</b> Is there any one piece of advice you would give your parents?
<p><b>Daria:</b> Mom, Dad: Slow down. Take some time off. Leave the car keys.
<p><b>LM:</b> Why do you dress that way?
<p><b>Daria:</b> What way?
<p><b>LM:</b> Do you and your sister, Quinn, borrow each other's clothes?
<p><b>Daria:</b> No, but I borrow her toothbrush when I'm polishing my boots.
<p><b>LM:</b> Have you ever considered letting Quinn give you a makeover?
<p><b>Daria:</b> As a matter of a fact, I plan to do that - right after I have all my teeth pulled out without anesthetic.
<p><b>LM:</b> C'mon, you must think Quinn is good for something.
<p><b>Daria:</b> Yes, she's a vital research tool in the search for a link between bouncy hair and brain damage.
<p><b>LM:</b> Why don't you and your sister get along?
<p><b>Daria:</b> This is just a hunch - but could it be because I abhor everything she stands for?
<p><b>LM:</b> Who do you discuss your problems with?
<p><b>Daria:</b> I talk to my friend Jane. She doesn't judge me. That because she's not listening.
<p><b>LM:</b> Jane seems pretty cool.
<p><b>Daria:</b> Oh sure, <i>now</i>. When I met her, she was wearing a "New Kids on the Block" tour jacket. She's lucky she found me.
<p><b>LM:</b> Do you drink at parties?
<p><b>Daria:</b> No way. I don't want people there to start looking good to me.
<p><b>LM:</b> Do you like it if a guy holds open a door for you?
<p><b>Daria:</b> I like it if a guy holds open a door, steps through it, shuts it behind him and keeps going.
<p><b>LM:</b> Would you change anything about your interpersonal skills?
<p><b>Daria:</b> Well, I'm pretty honest. I need to work on that.
<p><b>LM:</b> Are you looking forward to college?
<p><b>Daria:</b> I can't wait. In fact, I've already begun collecting used pizza cartons and sweat socks, so I'll have a head start decorating my dorm room.
<p><b>LM:</b> If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?
<p><b>Daria:</b> My home planet.
<p><b>LM:</b> How would you make the world a better place, if you could?
<p><b>Daria:</b> I would take the people who enjoy being with people and put them on an island. Then the rest of us would have a lot more room.
<p><b>LM:</b> Do you believe in heaven and hell?
<p><b>Daria:</b> I don't know about heaven, but I've lived through Class Picture Day.
