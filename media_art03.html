DARIA: Suburban Screams<br>
By Holly Hilton (<a href="mailto:spinferno@aol.com">SPINferno@aol.com</a>)</b><br>
<p>This is not your little brother's Beavis and Butthead. Like NBCs Frasier, Daria (Mondays at 10:30 p.m.) is a cerebral spinoff that transcends its predecessor. Right away, its clear from the bold Red Meat-inspired animation and Thorazine-tinged "La la La la la" theme music that Daria bears little resemblance to B&B or its grown-up cousin, FOXs King of the Hill.
<p>Sixteen-year-old Daria Morgendorffer is a Doc Martens-wearing, irony-spewing wisecracker who knows how to spell "Janeane Garofalo." In the first episode, the Morgendorffer clan moves from Beavis and Buttheads turf of Highland to multi-ethnic Lawndale. Almost immediately, Daria is placed in a special ed class for kids with low self-esteem, where she meets fellow cynic Jane Lane. Jane, who has intentionally failed the class six times, says, "I like having low self-esteem. It makes me feel special." Daria claims, "I don't have low self-esteem. It's a mistake. I have low esteem for everyone else."
<p>Although Daria's life is filled with vacant jocks and cheerleaders, clueless relatives, and teachers who can't be bothered to learn her name, these characters are far from one-dimensional. In fact, Daria's touches of reality make it a worthy successor to My So-Called Life's teen angst throne.
<p>Daria probably isn't destined to become a feature film starring Mr. and Mrs. Bruce Willis, but it certainly takes some of the "empty" out of MTV.
