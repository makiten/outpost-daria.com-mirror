<p>MTV's Daria Morgendorffer, that sarcastic, slacker chick we all know and love, gives up her secrets for a successful school year. Use them at your own risk.
<ol>
<li>Never make eye contact with a teacher who utters the words "school spirit" or "extra credit."
<li>If something seems really stupid, it probably is.
<li>Avoid dating guys whose names are verbs, such as Rip or Slash.
<li>It's okay to swap outfits with your friends... but not during class.
<li>Whatever that smell in your locker is, it's not going to improve with time.
<li>Never accept a collect call from a prison inmate, unless it's one of your former teachers.
<li>Teachers prefer book reports that are neatly typed on a computer over those scrawled in lipstick on a supersized Mr. Goodbar wrapper.
<li>Nail polish is meant to be applied <i>externally.</i>
<li>Avoid after-school jobs that involve mopping up blood.
<li>No matter what pressure is brought upon you, avoid the Salisbury steak.
</ol>
