To promote "Is It College Yet?", Daria is interviewed by <i>CBS Early Show</i> anchor Jane Clayson.  Here is the transcript of the interview, courtesy of fan Jessica Gonzalez:<br>
<br>
<hr>
<p align="justify">
<b>Jane Clayson:</b> Since making her debut in 1996, viewers have watched the very animated Daria Morgendorffer deal with the pressures of being a high school student. All of that comes to an end tonight when MTV airs its second <i>Daria</i> movie, "Is It College Yet?" She recently stopped by our studio for a one-on-one chat.<br><br>
<i>(Cuts to a scene from "Is It College Yet?": Daria being interviewed by Lisa Goldwin, the admissions officer from Bromwell University)</i><br><br>
<b>Lisa:</b> Daria, now that you've had a chance to "drink in the campus," so to speak, what are your impressions?<br><br>
<b>Daria <i>(voice-over)</i>:</b> Talk about the atmosphere. No, that's frivolous. Talk about resources. No, she'll think I mean money. The campus. No, shallow. Oh no, inappropriately-long pause. Talk. Say anything.<br><br>
<b>Daria:</b> Um, I like the campus. The dorms, and um, libraries. The learning... feeling?<br><br>
<i>(Cuts back to the Early Show studio, with JC in a chair on the right, and Daria in a chair on the left. This part of the interview was first filmed with JC talking to an empty chair, and then Daria was animated in afterwards.)</i><br><br>
<b>JC:</b> Through the magic of television and technology, Daria is here.<br><br>
<b>Daria:</b> Good morning, Jane.<br><br>
<b>JC:</b> Nice to see you. For those that may not be familiar with all your hard work, describe who you are -- describe yourself.<br><br>
<b>Daria:</b> I'm just your average American teenager, interested in the same things as other teenagers: reading long Russian novels, being alone for weeks at a time, and issuing a continuous stream of subtly contemptuous remarks.<br><br>
<b>JC:</b> Mmhmm. Sounds pretty normal. Did you expect the show to last?<br><br>
<b>Daria:</b> Not really. Our show isn't your typical MTV fare, in that the characters frequently speak in complete sentences. So I didn't expect it to have such a long life. I suppose MTV just couldn't deny its quality. Either that or MTV forgot it was on.<br><br>
<b>JC:</b> <i>(chuckle)</i> This film chronicles the process of you, uh, getting into college. How difficult was that?<br><br>
<b>Daria:</b> Not so difficult. I just slightly misspelled Morgendorffer as Rockefeller on the application and dropped a few hints about contributing a new football stadium.<br><br>
<b>JC:</b> What was the hardest part about the process?<br><br>
<b>Daria:</b> The hardest part about getting into college was spending four years in high school. If I had to do it all over again, I would've applied directly from kindergarten.<br><br>
<b>JC:</b> So what did you expect?<br><br>
<b>Daria:</b> I expected to be judged by my academic achievements and willingness to work hard. <i>(face drops)</i> As opposed to high school, where I was judged by my nails.<br><br>
<b>JC:</b> <i>(chuckle)</i> A little bit like life, huh? Um, are you going to miss your family and friends, Daria?<br><br>
<b>Daria:</b> I don't know. But I'm really looking forward to putting enough distance between us to find out.<br><br>
<b>JC:</b> Once you're in college, do you think that you'll find the happiness that has eluded you for, really, all your life?<br><br>
<b>Daria:</b> <i>(frowns)</i> Why do people assume I'm unhappy just because I mope around all the time, saying snide things in a deadpan voice? I find that very judgmental. <i>(pause)</i> But in answer to your question: God, I hope so.<br><br>
<b>JC:</b> You made your debut, Daria, on the MTV show <i>Beavis and Butt-head</i>. Do you still keep in touch with those guys?<br><br>
<b>Daria:</b> I'd like to. But first, they have to figure out that when the telephone makes that funny sound, you're supposed to pick it up and say hello.<br><br>
<b>JC:</b> So this film is really the end of an era for you. Are you going to miss television?<br><br>
<b>Daria:</b> I'm not necessarily leaving television. In fact, I'm talking to HBO about a project right now. It's pretty much the same as my current show, except I curse my head off and sleep around like crazy. And, oh yeah, I'm in the Mafia.<br><br>
<b>JC:</b> Just details, details, right? Maybe a reunion show then, perhaps?<br><br>
<b>Daria:</b> I'd say that depends on whether anyone from MTV is watching this interview. <i>(turns to camera, pleading look)</i> I was taken out of context, I swear. <i>(smirks)</i><br><br>
<b>JC:</b> <i>(chuckles)</i> Well, good luck to you, Daria. We'll look forward to the movie. Let's see if I can shake your hand. <i>(leans forward)</i><br><br>
<b>Daria:</b> <i>(shakes hand)</i> I've never done this with one of you three-dimensional people before. Weird.<br><br>
<b>JC:</b> Daria Morgendorffer. Thank you.<br><br>
<b>Daria:</b> Thank you. <i>(smiles)</i><br>
