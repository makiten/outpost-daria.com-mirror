Bernstein, sent along a note to several well-known <i>Daria</i> webmasters (including myself and Kara Wild) that she will be teaching an animation writing class this summer at New York's Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art (MOCCA), and to pass the word along to anyone who may be interested.

            When it comes to cartoons, anything can happen! Yet, although animation is unbound by reality or gravity, successful cartoon writing is grounded in classic storytelling skills, thoughtful character development, and clever dialogue. This class is an opportunity to explore the particular challenges and rewards of writing for animation. Screenings, lectures, in-class exercises, and enjoyable home assignments demystify the process. If you have already created animated characters or are in the process of developing your own show (anything from a single webtoon to a full-fledged series) you will be encouraged to incorporate your existing project into the course work--and receive valuable feedback from the instructor as well as your fellow students! Newbies are welcome, too. Just bring your imagination. [Note: while this course will focus on TV animation, shortform and feature length animation will be discussed, as well.]<br>
            <br>

      Naturally, like all previous news of an "immiment DVD release," there's plenty of reasons to be skeptical, particularly since we've been burned plenty of times in the past. However, this particular report gives more reason to hope than ever, given the presence of the ad in an official MTV DVD release (which amounts to the closest thing we've ever gotten to an "official announcement").<br>
      <br>
      <i>September 15, 2009</i> - <a href="http://www.the-wildone.com/dvdaria/" target="_blank">DVDaria</a> webmaster Kara Wild received a note from Glenn Eichler (via Michelle Klein-H&auml;ss) that the <i>Daria</i> DVDs are still on track for a fall 2010 release.<br>
      <br>
      Keep checking with <a href="http://www.the-wildone.com/dvdaria/" target="_blank">Kara Wild's DVDaria site</a> for further updates. You can keep checking here, too, but Kara updates more often than I do. :-) Finally, thanks to the several dozen people who e-mailed me with the news (and continue to do so almost every day); it looks like your long wait may <i>finally</i> be over (*fingers crossed*)!<br>

      <i>September 21, 2008</i> - <i>Daria</i> creator Glenn Eichler was one of the recipients of the 2008 Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety or Music Program at the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards. Glenn won as a member of the writing staff for <i>The Colbert Report</i>, Comedy Central's spin-off of <i>The Daily Show</i> that critiques politics and the media (the show and its host, Stephen Colbert, satirizes pundit-driven shows like Fox News' <i>The O'Reilly Factor</i>).<br>
      <br>
      Shortly after the awards show aired, longtime <i>Daria</i> fan Kara Wild (acting on a suggestion from Deref, another longtime fan from Down Under) headed up an effort to send Glenn a congratulatory e-mail, consisting of an original drawing by <i>fan artiste extraordinaire</i> S.C. (shown here; click on it for full-size version) accompanied by lauditory messages from fans. Here is Glenn's response, courtesy of Ms. Wild (originally posted on <a href="http://www.thepaperpusher.net/" target="_blank">the PPMB</a>):<br>

            Wow, Kara, that is so nice. Please thank everyone for me. And I love that picture -- I think that's going to be my new wallpaper.<br>
            <br>
            Obviously it was pretty great to win the Emmy, and since I've already been asked this several times, let me assure you that each of us got our own statue -- all 15 or 16 or us, however many there were. There were a lot of interesting questions at the security lines at LAX the next day.<br>
            <br>
            Let me also take this opportunity to thank everyone for their continued interest in "Daria" even seven years after it left the MTV-waves. I'm very proud to have done something that affected people so strongly, and I'm pretty sure everyone on the "Daria" team looks back at that time as a high point of their work lives... even the artists in the office next to mine who covered their bulletin board with sketches of the characters engaging in, well, I believe they call it "high-risk behavior." I'm afraid if we had done a sixth season, some of those sketches might have ended up as plotlines.<br>
            <br>
            Incidentally, most of us who worked on the production side of the show are still in touch, and everyone seems to be doing pretty well. Every so often there's an MTV Animation reunion where we'll see each other. Meanwhile I always get a big kick out of turning on the TV and seeing one of the actors who has made it to be the big time. (It always seems to be Sarah Drew.) I even saw Geoffrey Arend at the Emmys... it was a real time-warp moment to be clutching my Emmy for Colbert and be congratulated by someone from "Daria."<br>
            <br>
            BTW, I've noticed that MTV3 has started running the show again, sporadically, and in Spanish. Maybe it'll work its way to MTV2 in English. I got to watch it the other day for the first time in a couple of years. Still love Karen Disher's character designs.<br>
            <br>
            In any case, Colbert, while a completely different type of show and routine, is a lot of fun, and I do feel like I'm still fighting the good fight against hypocrisy. Or just making poop jokes, depending on the day. Weirdly, the Colbert studio is literally a block away on 10th Avenue from Sync Sound, where we recorded all five seasons of "Daria," so I even run into our engineers now and then at the deli.<br>
            <br>
            Feel free to share this with everyone, and again, my thanks.

      <i>June 25, 2006</i> - According to several sources (as well as keen observation), it appears that <i>Daria's</i> run on The N may very well be over. According to fan Greybird, the last sighting of Our Heroine on the network was the showing of <a href="ep_iicy.html">"Is It College Yet?"</a> on June 4. The show no longer appears on any programming grid available via the Internet. In addition, The N's <i>Daria</i> webpage has been replaced by one for a show called "Whistler."<br>
      <br>
      Ah, well. Personally, I'll not trash The N for this decision; it's very likely that their contract to show <i>Daria</i> had expired, and they decided not to renew. I won't even get on thier case for how they treated the show, because when all is said and done, at least they did show it, exposing Our Heroine to an entirely new audience. Let's hope that some other network will pick up the show in the near future (or maybe -- dare I say it? -- we'll finally see some DVD releases?).<br>

      <i>May 23, 2002</i> - Information posted on MTV's <i>Daria</i> message board indicates that <i>Daria</i> episodes will begin running on The N cable channel in summer 2002. (The N is a relatively new spinoff of Nickelodeon, and thus is not very widespread.) No details on specific airtimes yet, though it looks like episodes will air on or after 6:00 PM (commercials currently on Noggin advertising the show say that it's coming to "The N," which is Noggin's after-6:00 programming block... sort of a "Nick at Nite" for older kids). Looks like fan speculation about <i>Daria</i> going into second-run syndication is coming to pass!<br>
      <br>
      <i>May 28, 2002</i> - Nickelodeon issues a <a href="news_noggin_press_release.html">press release</a> announcing <i>Daria's</i> debut on The N, which kicks off with a weeklong marathon of episodes and "Is It Fall Yet?".<br>
      <br>
      <i>July 2, 2002</i> - <i>Daria</i> begins airing on The N. Sadly, it looks like they have taken a butcher knife to the episodes, most likely to remove objectionable content (example: in "Is It Fall Yet?", all references to Alison's bisexuality, including her advances towards Jane, have been completely excised, turning her major role into little more than a one-scene appearance). Kudos to The N for airing <i>Daria</i>, but a big wet raspberry to them for such wholesale (but not unexpected) slaughter.<br>
