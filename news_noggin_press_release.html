      <br>
      NOGGIN'S NEW NETWORK FOR TWEENS<br>
      KICKS OFF SUMMER WITH <i>DARIA</i></u><br>
      <br>
      THE N UNVEILS A MARATHON OF THE TV MOVIE <i>DARIA: IS IT FALL YET?</i> ON TUESDAY, JULY 2, FOLLOWED BY FOUR NIGHTS OF BACK-TO-BACK EPISODES OF "DARIA" FROM WEDNESDAY, JULY 3 TO SATURDAY, JULY 6<br>

      <b>New York, NY, May 28, 2002</b> -- Summer nights just got wittier as America's reluctant heroine is back every evening on The N! Noggin's new network for tweens will debut <i>Daria</i>, the hit animated sitcom from MTV, with two sizzling summer programming marathons. The N will celebrate the addition of <i>Daria</i> to its program schedule with a non-stop, marathon of her first original, 90-minute TV movie, <i>"Daria: It It Fall Yet?"</i> on <u>Tuesday, July 2 from 8:00 p.m. to 3:30 a.m. (ET</u>), with an encore presentation on Sunday, July 7 from 8:00 p.m. to 3:30 a.m. (ET).<br>
      <br>
      The N will unveil the animated sitcom, <i>Daria</i> with four consecutive nights of back-to-back episodes of <i>Daria</i> from Wednesday, July 3 through Saturday, July 6 from 8:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m. (ET).<br>
      <br>
      <u>Beginning, Monday, July 8, <i>Daria</i> will settle into its regular airtime -- every evening, Monday – Sunday at 10:00 p.m. (ET/PT) only on The N.</u><br>
      <br>
      <i>Daria: Is It Fall Yet?</i> features the voices of Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl as Daniel Dotson (Jane's art teacher) and Carson Daly as David Sorensen (Quinn's tutor).<br>
      <br>
      It's summertime as Daria and friends deal with their summer journeys, the heat rash, the mosquitoes, and the runny ice cream--they're all wishing…is it fall yet? Bummed that she can't just sleep summer away, Daria finds herself forced into "volunteering" at the "OK To Cry Corral," a summer camp for the overly sensitive and those who aspire to be. At camp, Daria comes face-to-face with a younger camper who eerily shares Daria's disposition.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, Daria's very popular younger sister, Quinn, and her friends are having their own summer adventures. Quinn, submits to tutoring from no-nonsense David Sorensen in hopes of getting into the party school of her choice – but his immunity to her bag of flirting tricks leads her to wonder if she's losing her touch. Following Quinn's lead, the Fashion Club also gets tutored by David, with not so great results.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Daria</i>, which debuted on MTV in March of 1997, is a spin-off of Beavis and Butt-Head's only female friend. The 65-episode series chronicles the experiences of Daria Morgendorffer, a smart, funny and sardonic teenager blessed with an uncanny ability to turn potential disaster to her own advantage. Daria lives in Lawndale with her stressed-out, career-fixated parents, Helen and Jake, and her relentlessly cute and popular younger sister, Quinn.<br>
      <br>
      In each episode of <i>Daria</i>, we find our heroine in exasperating situations that she combats with sarcasm and irony, but she then takes action and manages to turn things around for herself. Granted it is usually mischievous, but at least it amuses her until the time she figures out a way to escape.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Daria</i> was developed by Glenn Eichler and Susie Lewis Lynn. The show is produced by Susie Lewis Lynn. Glenn Eichler is the story editor. John Andrews is supervising producer. Abby Terkuhle is executive producer.<br>
