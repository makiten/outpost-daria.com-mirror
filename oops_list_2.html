    <li>When Mr. O'Neill is talking on the phone, there are only 9 buttons on the phone when there should be at least 12.
    <li>When Daria and Jane had their fill of pizza, there's a salt shaker in front of Daria in one shot, but it's gone in another.
    <li>Right before Mr. O'Neill runs out the door, you can see six holes on the receiver, but when he leaves, there's five.
    <li>When Jane and Daria are in the principal's office for the second time, Jane's eyes are black instead of blue in one shot.

When Sandi shoots back, the paintballs only hit Stacy and Tiffany but not Quinn, who nevertheless yelps as though she is being hit. Only Tiffany and Stacy's clothes are stained with paint, but when Sandi takes off her goggles and the view switches back to the girls, all of them are covered with paint; some paint is on Quinn's headgear, and two drops are on her face.

    <li>Everyone's playing paintball and they get shot, but the paint on their clothes disappears.

    <li>The tunnels are lit when Jake, and later Jake and Helen, crawl through them, despite the lack of a light source.

    <li>The blonde girl in front of Stacy has a black top when she and Quinn start talking, but when the class starts laughing her top changes to blue.
    <li>Quinn's essay is different from the one in "The Daria Database" (both versions are on the &lt;a href="ep203.html"&gt;"Quinn the Brain"&lt;/a&gt; episode page).
    <li>The girl sitting behind Daria in the cafeteria disappears and reappears when Quinn sits down. Ditto for Daria's backpack.
    <li>The guy in the background when Daria and Quinn are in the cafeteria moves through the line without a tray, but one suddenly appears when he goes to sit down.

    <li>The blue car in the bowling alley lot disappears in the closeup of Amy and Daria.
    <li>Brian was arguing with Erin, Rita, et al when Amy and Daria leave, so how did he arrive at the bowling alley before them? (Presuming it "is" Brian, which is still up for debate.)

    <li>When Quinn hands Helen her Daria-sitting schedule, the calendar on the wall is gone, but in the closeup of Helen it's back. (This also happens in subsequent scenes.)
    <li>At the dinner table, Quinn's fork suddenly appears where there wasn't one before.
    <li>When Jane and Evan talk about Daria, one minute they're by the classroom door; the next minute, Evan's by a trophy case.

    <li>Quinn's glass goes from empty to full during dinner. Also, her pizza crust suddenly transforms into a full (cheese-less) slice after Jake gets the phone.
    <li>When Daria goes upstairs to talk to Trent, she doesn't have the cordless phone. When she arrives upstairs, she now has it.
    <li>When Jane presses redial on the phone she presses the "1" button. As a general rule, the redial button is either the "*" or "#" button (provided the phone doesn't have its own redial button).
    <li>When Daria is getting prepped to get pierced, the antiseptic bottle disappears and reappears.
    <li>Why does Axl have his rings on *over* his rubber gloves when he's piercing Daria? You'd think he's just take them off completely.
    <li>Trent never does get the piercing he wanted (as part of the "buy one, get one free" special).
    <li>When Quinn is looking in the bathroom as Daria is scratching her navel, her belt is yellow, but when she runs in there, it turns blue.
    <li>At the fashion show, Stacy's legs are bare in the opening shot, but when Helen tells Quinn they're next, she suddenly has leggings.
    <li>Quinn and Helen both have their hair done, but at the fashion show, Quinn's hair is different while Helen's is the same.

    <li>In the first classroom scene, the clock over the door reads 5:00.
    <li>The large Doodad Shop guy (from "Malled") is on the bus in the Kevin/Brittany story.
    <li>Brittany's stepmother, Ashley-Amber, is in the church in the Kevin/Brittany story, but Daria (who's writing the story) hasn't met her yet.
    <li>Daria is right-handed, yet when she wraps up the Kevin/Brittany story in Jane's room, she's writing with her left hand.
    <li>The leaf that Helen knocks off the rubber plant with the cordless phone is back next season.
    <li>Right after Daria says "Another masterpiece," we cut to Daria and Jane walking by a house. The house's driveway is green like the lawn next to it.
    <li>In the same scene, another house they pass has no sidewalk leading up to the front door.
    <li>It's hard to tell for sure, but it looks like Mack has two Queens of Hearts in his deck.
    <li>The disappearing wall calendar in the Morgendorffer kitchen displays the same behavior in Daria's future story.
    <li>The way Jake holds the cards while dealing in Daria's future story suggests that he's looking at them.
    <li>Daria tells Jane that she can read the story about her and Kevin, but she threw that one away after she wrote it. (In Jane's room, no less!)
