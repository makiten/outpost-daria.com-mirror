<p><i>(opening music)</i>
<p><i>(at school)</i>
<p><i>(Daria and Kevin are seated at the same table; as Daria is writing, her pencil breaks)</i>
<p>Daria - Hey, Kevin? Can I borrow your pencil?
<p>Kevin - Sure.
<p>Daria - <i>(grabs pencil)</i> Thanks.
<p><i>(in the hallway)</i>
<p><i>(Daria and Jane are walking down the hallway)</i>
<p>Kevin - Hey, Daria, wait up.
<p>Daria - Oh, yeah. Sorry, Kevin. <i>(hands pencil back)</i>
<p>Kevin - I know what you're after, but it won't work.
<p>Daria - I don't want the pencil. I just forgot to give it back.
<p>Kevin - Let's not play games, Daria. You desire me, don't you?
<p>Daria - Uh, excuse me?
<p>Kevin - I can tell. It's like a fifth sense I got. But unfortunately or whatever, I already got a chick. But we can still be friends or whatever.
<p>Daria - Thanks, Kevin. That helps.
<p>Kevin - Great! Can I borrow your science homework?
<p><i>(Daria hands him her homework)</i>
<p>Kevin - Hey, thanks a lot. Sorry if you were hurt. <i>(leaves)</i>
<p>Daria - I just got blown off by a guy I didn't even go after.
<p>Jane - You should find a safe, legal alternative to killing him.
<p>Daria - I already have. When I get through with him, there'll be nothing left but jelly.
<p>Jane - Well, you won't have to do anything to his brain.
<p><i>(at Kevin's house)</i>
<p><i>(Kevin can be seen through the window, lifting weights, as Daria walks up to the front door)</i>
<p>Daria <i>(V.O.)</i> - Nothing left but jelly...
<p><i>(Daria rings doorbell; Kevin opens door)</i>
<p>Daria - I baked these cookies for you! <i>(holds out a tray of cookies)</i> They're shaped like hearts!
<p>Kevin - Uh... but...
<p>Daria - You don't have to use words around me, Kevin. You don't need them. This is just to say, "No hard feelings." Bye! <i>(leaves)</i>
<p><i>(at Pizza King)</i>
<p><i>(Kevin and Brittany are seated in a booth)</i>
<p>Kevin - And then Scully, he grabs the kid and gives him a tenth degree wedgie.
<p>Brittany - <i>(giggles)</i> He's funny.
<p>Daria - Hi, Kevin!
<p>Kevin - Uh, hi, Daria.
<p>Brittany - Who's she?
<p>Daria - I'm Kevin's good friend. Which do you like better, the beach or the mountains?
<p>Kevin - Uh... I guess the beach. Because of, like, the bikinis.
<p>Daria - Me, too. Just checking. Oh, and here's some extra homework of mine you can use. See you later... friend. <i>(leaves)</i>
<p>Brittany - Oooh! Manipulator! <i>(dumps drink on Kevin's head)</i> Pinhead! Weasel!
<p>Kevin - Hey, hey, slow down! What was the first one you said?
<p><i>(in the hallway)</i>
<p><i>(Kevin opens his locker and sees flowers and a love note from Daria)</i>
<p>Kevin - Really...
<p><i>(in shop class)</i>
<p><i>(Daria is cutting wood as Kevin walks into the classroom)</i>
<p>Kevin - <i>(shouts)</i> Hey, Daria! Me and Brittany decided to see other people! So, since you're sorta next on the list or whatever...
<p>Daria - <i>(shouts)</i> What?
<p>Kevin - <i>(shouts)</i> I said, I was wondering if you and me could get together?
<p>Daria - Mmm, I don't think so, Kevin. It might ruin our friendship. <i>(leaves with Jane)</i>
<p>Girl - Geek.
<p>Kevin - Hey, it's cool. We're good friends.
<p><i>(at Daria's house)</i>
<p><i>(the Morgendorffers are seated around the dinner table)</i>
<p>Helen - Quinn, there were four calls on the machine from Kevin.
<p>Jake - Doesn't he have your beeper number?
<p>Quinn - They aren't for me. They're for Daria.
<p>Helen - Daria?
<p>Jake - Do you need a beeper, Daria?
<p>Helen - Do you want to talk to us about anything, honey?
<p><i>(doorbell rings)</i>
<p>Daria - I was just about to open up, too. <i>(leaves)</i>
<p>Helen - You think she meant it?
<p><i>(at the front door)</i>
<p>Kevin - I'm not giving up, Daria. I know there's a chemistry or whatever.
<p>Daria - I hate to say this, Kevin...
<p><i>(Quinn peeks around the doorframe)</i>
<p>Quinn - Kevin?
<p>Kevin - Quinn? What are you doing here?
<p>Quinn - I live here. You're not here to see my sister, are you?
<p>Kevin - Whoa! You're sisters with a brain?
<p>Quinn - I know! Doesn't it suck?
<p>Kevin - Really. Well, you want to go for a ride or something?
<p>Quinn - Let me get my stuff. <i>(leaves)</i>
<p>Kevin - So anyways, you're probably right about us being friends and stuff, because we care about each others feelings and whatnot.
<p>Daria - Yeah, and I care even more about your feelings than my own.
<p>Kevin - Really? <i>(beat)</i> Man, I never would have thought you'd be sisters with someone hot.
<p><i>(at Pizza King)</i>
<p>Jane - I don't understand why you're not trying to get revenge.
<p>Daria - I'm letting Quinn take care of that.
<p><i>(in Kevin's car)</i>
<p><i>(Quinn's pager beeps)</i>
<p>Kevin <i>(V.O.)</i> - Dammit! How many times is that thing gonna go off?
<p>Quinn <i>(V.O.)</i> - I'm beginning to think you don't like being with someone attractive and popular!
<p>Kevin <i>(V.O.)</i> - Sorry.
<p>Quinn <i>(V.O.)</i> - That's better. Now, get me to a pay phone.
<p><i>(Kevin starts car)</i>
<p><i>(closing music)</i>
