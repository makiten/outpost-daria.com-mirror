<p><i>(opening theme song)</i>
<p><i>(in the car; Jake is driving, Helen is riding shotgun, Quinn and Daria are in back)</i>
<p>Jake - <i>(singing)</i> I've been working on the railroad... come on, guys, we know this one. <i>(grumbles when no one joins in)</i>
<p><i>(car runs over road kill)</i>
<p>Quinn - Daddy!
<p>Jake - It was dead already, sweetheart. Just like the others.
<p>Quinn - How do you know?
<p>Daria - You didn't hear any screaming, did you?
<p>Quinn - I think people who run over animals should get run over themselves to see how they like it.
<p>Daria - What about unpopular animals?
<p>Quinn - Unpopular animals don't count.
<p>Daria - What about the stupid ones?
<p>Helen - Come on, girls. We'll be at Susan and Doug's soon.
<p>Daria - Hooray.
<p>Jake - It'll be fun. You can hang out with Ramona.
<p>Daria - Ramona's three.
<p><i>(at Susan and Doug's house)</i>
<p><i>(the Morgendorffers are sitting in Susan and Doug's living room; Ramona sniffles and walks over to the group)</i>
<p>Helen - Daria, on the other hand, is more of a late bloomer -- socially -- and there's nothing wrong with that. Right, honey?
<p>Quinn - <i>(to Ramona)</i> Goo, goo, ga, ga. Goo-goo, ga-ga. Ramona. Ramona. Goo-goo, ga-ga. <i>(Ramona blows nose on Quinn's leg)</i> Ew!
<p><i>(Ramona grabs a book and walks over to Helen)</i>
<p>Ramona - Read to me.
<p>Helen - Isn't she darling? What is she reading now? <i>(takes book, "My First S.A.T. Study Guide")</i>
<p>Susan - We have to think about college application time. <i>(sighs)</i> I mean, it's so hard to get into a good school now. What are you guys doing about it?
<p><i>(in the car)</i>
<p>Daria - One more time: I am not taking a college prep course. Actually, I may just skip college and stay home. It'll save me the trouble of moving back in later.
<p><i>(Jake swerves into traffic, barely avoiding another car before straightening out)</i>
<p>Helen - Watch the road! Daria, if you don't get into a decent school your life will be ruined. End of discussion.
<p>Quinn - Way to go, Mom. She can't get her way all the time.
<p>Helen - Actually, Quinn, it wouldn't hurt if you took the course too.
<p>Quinn - Wait a minute!
<p>Daria - Maybe we can sit together.
<p><i>(at school)</i>
<p><i>(most of the familiar faces are in the college prep class, including Daria and Quinn)</i>
<p>Instructor - Today's admission standards are more rigorous than ever, which is why...
<p>Jane - Can we get on with this? I have someplace to go. <i>(at Jodie's quizzical look)</i> Television counts as a place.
<p>Instructor - Okay, okay. Topic one: testing. You have to know how to take a test. Like, when you get a multiple-choice question, you can usually eliminate two of the answers right off.
<p>Brittany - Excuse me, sir? Does that work with true/false?
<p><i>(instructor sighs)</i>
<p><i>(time passes)</i>
<p>Instructor - Okay, this is an informational sheet Push Comes to Love sends around to 600 leading colleges. It's called <i>My Personal Goals and Aspirations.</i> Let's all talk about college...
<p>Kevin - Pssst. Daria, what did you get for number one?
<p>Daria - The thing about who I really am?
<p>Kevin - Yeah.
<p>Daria - Try "cross-dresser."
<p>Kevin - Thanks, man, I owe you one.
<p>Instructor - ... the goal of the worksheet is to help you focus on what you want out of college. Okay, when you get a multiple choice...
<p><i>(Kevin's daydream begins)</i>
<p><i>(Kevin walks through a college campus; the other football players are taller and more bulked-up than he is, which jolts Kevin out of his daydream)</i>
<p>Instructor - ...you focus on personal goals and aspirations...
<p><i>(Kevin's daydream begins again; this time, he's as tall and built as the other players)</i>
<p><i>(a beautiful blonde woman approaches)</i>
<p>Blonde - Kevin... thank you for my beautiful roses. Where did you get them?
<p>Kevin - Oh, it was nothing. My high-school girlfriend sent them to me.
<p>Blonde - <i>(laughs)</i> What a child.
<p><i>(Kevin's daydream ends)</i>
<p>Instructor - Okay, the goal of college...
<p><i>(Brittany's daydream begins)</i>
<p><i>(Brittany, in a cap and gown, is strolling down a fashion runway)</i>
<p>Woman - Oh, Brittany.
<p>Emcee - <i>(singing)</i> She's got a dark, threatened look. She never cracked no books. La-la-la...
<p>Kevin - <i>(shouts)</i> Brittany, you're the only girl I ever loved! Will you marry me?
<p><i>(crowd cheers as Kevin is hauled away and Brittany takes her bows)</i>
<p><i>(Brittany's daydream ends)</i>
<p><i>(Jane's daydream begins)</i>
<p><i>(Jane and an art critic are standing in a rather large loft)</i>
<p>Critic - This is all quite amazing. How could you afford such a space in New York?
<p>Jane - I used the money my parents saved for college.
<p>Critic - Brilliant! Just like your art.
<p><i>(Jane's daydream ends)</i>
<p>Instructor - ... it's called "Focus on How to..."
<p><i>(Quinn's daydream begins)</i>
<p><i>(Quinn walks up to a house and knocks on the door; it's answered by a muscular guy wearing nothing but a towel around his waist, a guy dressed like a preppie, and a guy in a cowboy outfit)</i>
<p>Muscle Guy - Hey, this must be the new roommate. Guys.
<p>Preppie Guy - Excellent, the new roommate.
<p>Cowboy Guy - Howdy, roomy.
<p>Quinn - Hi.
<p>Muscle Guy - All right, guys. Best man wins.
<p><i>(guys start fighting each other)</i>
<p><i>(Quinn's daydream ends)</i>
<p>Instructor - ... like two of the answers are more rigorous than...
<p><i>(Daria's daydream begins)</i>
<p><i>(Daria and a turtleneck-wearing professor are strolling along a college campus)</i>
<p>Professor - Daria, I know it's only the first week of freshmen year, but I wonder if you'd consider transferring to the graduate school.
<p>Daria - I'm not really sure I want to be a professional student.
<p>Professor - But I don't want you to study. I want you to teach.
<p>Daria - Well...
<p>Professor - Not here, of course. On our Paris campus.
<p>Daria - Oh! Okay.
<p>Professor - Superb! <i>(gives Daria a shoulder hug)</i> Now I can use your dorm room to carry on affairs with some of the more beautiful undergraduates. Thank you!
<p>Daria - How come even in my fantasies everyone's a jerk?
<p><i>(Daria's daydream ends)</i>
<p><i>(at Daria's house)</i>
<p><i>(the Morgendorffers are at the kitchen table)</i>
<p>Daria - Then we filled out this worksheet, and that was pretty much it. Money well spent, since it wasn't my money.
<p>Quinn - You left out the best part.
<p>Daria - Getting a date with the instructor is only the best part to <i>you</i>.
<p>Quinn - It's not a date. We're meeting to discuss scholarship options.
<p>Jake - Scholarship? Way to go, sweetie.
<p>Daria - There's no such thing as a making-out scholarship.
<p>Quinn - Uh, excuse me, but I think <i>he</i> would know better than <i>you</i>. Anyway, the best part, I meant, was the trip.
<p>Jake - What trip?
<p>Quinn - We have to visit a college of our choosing.
<p>Helen - Great! We'll go to Middleton!
<p>Jake - We'll all head up to the old alma mater this weekend!
<p>Quinn - Wait! <i>We</i> get to pick the college, and no one said <i>you</i> could come.
<p>Helen - But Quinn, your father and I would love it if you kids followed in our footsteps.
<p>Quinn - We're walking? Ugh! <i>(leaves)</i>
<p>Daria - Maybe we should visit your old nursery school first.

<p><hr>

<p><i>(at Middleton College)</i>
<p><i>(the Morgendorffers, in casual clothes, are strolling along the campus)</i>
<p>Jake - Gosh, the old place has hardly changed a bit. Hey, hey, my man. Toss me that disk, dude.
<p>Student - Get a life.
<p>Jake - Cool. Whatever. Maybe next time. <i>(mutters)</i> College punks.
<p><i>(a girl in her late teens or early twenties approaches)</i>
<p>Heather - Hi, are you the Morgendorffers? I'm your tour guide, Heather. Welcome to Middleton.
<p>Jake - Hey, Heather. What's up?
<p>Heather - Uh... shall we get started? <i>(they begin walking)</i> These buildings date from when Middleton was a colonial religious college. Back then, the all-male student body attended chapel twice a day, and endured whippings as punishment for impure thoughts.
<p>Jake - What a bunch of stiffs they must have been, eh, girls?
<p><i>(water balloon drops on Jake's head)</i>
<p>Jake - Damn it! I'll kill you, college scum!
<p>Heather - But, Middleton's time-honored tradition of tomfoolery continues.
<p>Helen - Jake, honey, didn't that balloon just come out of your old dorm window?
<p>Jake - What? Hey, I think you're right. Come on, let's go take a look at the old cell. We got time before we go see the Bursar.
<p>Helen - Girls?
<p>Daria - I'm sure we'd only get in the way.
<p><i>(balloons and other objects drop to the ground just as Jake and Helen walk away)</i>
<p>Heather - Okay, next is the old bell tower in the center of campus -- the historical meeting place of...
<p>Quinn - That sounds really interesting. Which historic street are all the fraternities on?
<p>Daria - My sister wants to study group psychology.
<p>Heather - Right.
<p><i>(on fraternity row)</i>
<p><i>(Quinn drinks in the atmosphere as a female student approaches)</i>
<p>Quinn - At last... college.
<p>Girl - Aren't you a Theta pledge?
<p>Quinn - Well, uh... yes. Yes, I am.
<p>Girl - Then you'd better get over there and help clean the house steps, or the Council of Ancients will give you a noodle whipping you won't soon forget.
<p>Daria - A whipping. It's nice that they keep some of the old traditions.
<p>Quinn - Yes, ma'am. I was just directing these girls to the hair and nail salon. You know, community service.
<p>Girl - You're excused. But make it quick. Do you have your scrub brush?
<p>Quinn - No, ma'am.
<p>Girl - <i>(hands toothbrush to Quinn)</i> Good luck, pledge. <i>(leaves)</i>
<p>Daria - Quinn, you're in high school.
<p>Quinn - Listen, Daria. I don't stop you from reading. Don't stop me from this. <i>(leaves)</i>
<p>Heather - She's God's problem now, kid. Let's get out of here. This place gives me the creeps.
<p><i>(in Jake's old dorm room)</i>
<p><i>(several students are lounging around and listening to music as Jake and Helen look on)</i>
<p>Helen - Well... it <i>smells</i> like your old room.
<p>Jake - Hey, guys, what's going down? You know, I think this might have been my crib when I went here. It's "crib" now, right? <i>(laughs, then stops when he realizes no one is paying attention to him)</i> We're just going to have a quick look-see, okay? Okay.
<p><i>(they approach a nerdy-looking boy working on a computer)</i>
<p>Helen - How refreshing to see someone doing school work.
<p>Guy - Actually, I'm sending an erotic letter to a female inmate I met on the Internet. I think she's female.
<p><i>(Helen walks over to the window and looks out over the campus)</i>
<p>Helen - Remember when I used to walk through the courtyard? You and all the other guys would lean out the window and shout obscene comments. <i>(laughs)</i> College men. Animals! <i>(beat)</i> Quinn! <i>(runs out)</i>
<p>Jake - Don't worry, men. The situation is under control. Hey, can any of you dudes tell me how to get to the Bursar's office? <i>(beat)</i> Okay, no problem, I'll find it myself.
<p><i>(in Heather's room)</i>
<p><i>(Daria, Heather, and her roommates are watching television)</i>
<p>Daria - So this is college?
<p>Heather - Pretty much. There's also the part about working a stupid job and begging your parents for money.
<p>Deliveryman - Heather? <i>(hands paper to Heather)</i>
<p>Heather - My psych term paper. Finally. Nobody respects deadlines anymore.
<p><i>(Daria reads the paper; her eyes go wide)</i>
<p>Daria - Uh, you paid somebody to write <i>this</i> for you?
<p>Heather - It was a collaboration. My part was to say how long it should be and when it was due.
<p>Daria - But the first paragraph doesn't even make sense. How much did you pay for this?
<p>Heather - Fifty bucks.
<p>Daria - I can fix this for you for ten bucks.
<p>Heather - Really? Great.
<p>Roommate #1 - Wow. You know anything about the English Civil War?
<p>Roommate #2 - How about Renaissance painting?
<p>Daria - What I don't know, I can fake. But cash only. I don't take checks from college students.
<p><i>(on campus)</i>
<p><i>(Helen is talking to another student; he's rather nervous at being talked to by Helen)</i>
<p>Helen - Her name's Quinn, and she looks, well... a lot like me. Some people say sisters even. Of course, I was a young mother. Too young, really. How old do you think I am?
<p>Guy - I don't really, um... I...
<p>Helen - Forty-s... forty-three. That is, in five years I'll be 43. Seems like only yesterday I was partying with the best of them. I was pretty wild. Still am, when I feel like it. But you're a college man. You probably know all about that.
<p>Guy - Um, I'm just a freshman and I... we're not really supposed to... I get headaches sometimes 'cause I'm allergic to things. And I... I sort of have to go now, bye. <i>(runs away)</i>
<p>Helen - Well, if you see her, just tell her I'm looking for her. <i>(mutters)</i> College punk.
<p><i>(in the Bursar's office)</i>
<p>Jake - I just can't figure out what all this is paying for.
<p>Bursar - I understand your feelings, Mr. Morgendorffer. Many of our parents experience similar sticker shock, if I may. <i>(laughs)</i> That's why I refer a lot of our parents to this institution. It's not a bank, but a family business that understands families. They can set you up with a cash loan on very agreeable terms.
<p>Jake - What's this address?
<p>Bursar - It's a candy store. That's their business. They sell candy. And make loans. Oh, and haul trash. They got a variety of interests, actually. <i>(slyly)</i> You play the ponies, Jake?

<p><hr>

<p><i>(in Heather's dorm room)</i>
<p><i>(Daria is sitting at a computer as a group of girls line up)</i>
<p>Daria - Okay, look, I'm not going to rewrite this paper for you, but I will give you a couple of tips that will help you rewrite it. First, the book title <u>Sons and Lovers</u> does not have an apostrophe in it... anywhere. Second, unless your ex-boyfriend is an authority on D.H. Lawrence, don't base your thesis on something he said while making out.
<p>Girl - Mm. What about something he said when we broke up?
<p>Daria - No.
<p>Girl - Mmm. Okay, thanks. <i>(hands Daria money and leaves)</i>
<p>Daria - Thank you, and good luck with the doctorate.
<p>Heather - You seem pretty comfortable with the brain-dead. So, let's go to a party.
<p><i>(on campus)</i>
<p><i>(Helen is taping a photo of Daria and Quinn on a bulletin board; as she bends down to pick up the tape, a rapid stapling of papers covers the photo)</i>
<p>Geek - Excuse me, ma'am. Could I trouble you for your underwear?
<p>Helen - Say what?
<p>Geek - <i>(whispers)</i> Your panties. May I have them?
<p>Helen - Why, you little bastard! Oh, wait a minute, hold on here... are you in a fraternity?
<p>Geek - Yes, ma'am. Sigma Stigmata, a.k.a., "Sigma Yo' Mama!" <i>(chuckling)</i>
<p>Helen - This is a prank, isn't it?
<p>Geek - Sort of, ma'am. See, it's a Stigmata tradition to fly a Middleton woman's panties from our flagpole.
<p>Helen - You guys!
<p>Geek - But since the house moved off-campus, we found that student panties aren't big enough to be seen from the quad. I've been observing you, ma'am. I think your underwear just might do the trick!
<p>Helen - Do the trick?! I'll do the trick to you, you little twerp! And your brothers, too! Frat geek!
<p><i>(she starts to chase the geek, but gives up as a breathless Jake runs up to her)</i>
<p>Jake - Helen! Helen! Terrible news.
<p>Helen - Oh, my God, the girls!
<p>Jake - No, no.
<p>Helen - What's happened?
<p>Jake - <i>(panting)</i> Tuition... crippling expense... maybe we can just... send... one of them... to college... Quinn... go... to beauty... school.
<p>Helen - Jake... get a grip. Right now, we don't even know where they are!
<p>Jake - <i>(panting)</i> Right. Then... let's go... campus police.
<p>Helen - The fuzz?
<p>Jake - <i>(panting)</i> We're... parents... now. Police... good. Missing daughters... bad.
<p>Helen - You're right. Those poor kids are probably scared to death.
<p><i>(at fraternity house)</i>
<p><i>(Quinn is talking to three fraternity guys, who are rather big and dumb-looking)</i>
<p>Quinn - Okay, look. I can't play the game for you, but I will give you a couple of tips so you can play. As you go around counting off, for every number that has a three in it or is a multiple of three, you say, "zoom." Every multiple of seven, or number with a seven in it, you say, "schwartz!"
<p>Frat Guy #1 - Can't we just play the one with the quarter?
<p>Quinn - But you look so cute when you say funny words. Besides, shouldn't you be saving your quarters for taking us out?
<p>Frat Guy #1 - One...
<p>Frat Guy #2 - Two...
<p>Frat Guy #3 - Zoom.
<p>Quinn - Good!
<p><i>(outside fraternity house)</i>
<p><i>(Quinn is hoisted on the shoulders of several frat guys as others circle around them)</i>
<p>Frat Guys - <i>(chanting)</i> Keg... Queen. Keg... Queen. Keg... Queen.
<p><i>(Daria and Heather approach)</i>
<p>Heather - Ah, they've chosen the Keg Queen. It's a huge honor. She gets to drive the kegs to and from the distributor.
<p><i>(siren wails in the distance)</i>
<p>Daria - Wait a minute. That's no queen -- that's my sister. And she doesn't even have a learner's permit.
<p><i>(campus police car pulls up; Jake and Helen emerge from the back seat as the frat guys set Quinn down on the ground)</i>
<p>Helen - Quinn! What did they do to you?!
<p>Quinn - They made me their queen! Isn't it great?!
<p>Daria - I think now would be a good time to teach Quinn about personal responsibility.
<p>Helen - Young lady, as the elder sister I hold <i>you</i> partially to blame.
<p>Daria - But... I stayed with the tour guide.
<p>Heather - Hi! <i>(waves)</i>
<p>Policeman - Are these your daughters, Mr. Morgendorffer?
<p>Jake - Yes, officer. Thank you for your help.
<p>Policeman - They appear to be underage, sir.
<p>Jake - Well, of course they're...!
<p>Quinn - Don't worry, Daddy, I have I.D.
<p>Policeman - We have strict rules about minors at fraternity parties. I'm afraid I'm going to have to escort you all off the campus -- immediately.
<p>Jake - But...
<p>Policeman - Don't make me use the cuffs, Mr. Morgendorffer.
<p>Frat Guy - Can we keep her?
<p>Helen - You certainly cannot!
<p>Frat Guy - Then can we have your underwear?
<p>Helen - You son of a...!
<p><i>(at school)</i>
<p><i>(the college prep class is in session again, this time to discuss the students' college experiences)</i>
<p>Instructor - Okay, okay... so, like, let's all talk about our college experiences. Uh...
<p>Kevin - My big brothers stripped me naked and covered me with molasses, and left me in the middle of a field at night! It was awesome!
<p>Brittany - I had a good time, too. I walked into the student center and these kids were reading poetry -- then they let me make up some of my own! And they were really interested in my feelings and thoughts and... stuff.
<p>Kevin - Huh? That sounds stupid.
<p>Brittany - Shut up, naked boy.
<p>Instructor - <i>(to Mack)</i> How about you?
<p>Mack - I learned about the first-string exemption. Turns out if you make the starting squad, you never have to take any exams.
<p>Instructor - All right!
<p>Mack - Yeah. I'm looking forward to a great education. May I please have my money back now?
<p>Instructor - <i>(chuckles and mutters)</i> You little... oh, and you two. How did you like the famous Middleton College?
<p>Quinn - Daria got us thrown out.
<p>Daria - <i>I</i> got us thrown out? I beg to differ, Keg Queen.
<p>Kevin - Keg Queen?! Can I have your autograph?
<p>Quinn - Dream on, naked boy.
<p>Instructor - Whoa, whoa, wait a minute! You got thrown out of Middleton? I, I just can't understand you kids sometimes. In my day, we had a little something called respect.
<p>Kevin - Uh, are we going to need to know this, or is this, like, personal advice or something?
<p><i>(instructor rolls his eyes)</i>
<p><i>(Daria and Jane are walking home)</i>
<p>Jane - Thrown out of college without enrolling first. I'm damn proud of you.
<p>Daria - Thanks.
<p>Jane - How's business?
<p>Daria - Booming. I have two econ problem sets and a paper on Kerouac that I have to get to the delivery guy by 9:00 P.M.... and then, I quit.
<p>Jane - But you're just getting started.
<p>Daria - I already feel burned out on college and I'm still in high school.
<p><i>(at Daria's house)</i>
<p><i>(Daria walks in the door and sees the rest of the family seated in the living room)</i>
<p>Jake - Hey, Daria, come on in!
<p>Daria - Uh... what happened? <i>(sits next to Quinn)</i>
<p>Quinn - Nothing -- only somebody in this family turned out to be college material.
<p>Helen - Quinn was accepted to Manatee College in Florida!
<p>Quinn - Remember those stupid worksheets we had to fill out for that course? Mine won.
<p>Jake - I'm so proud of you, honey.
<p>Quinn - Manatee... it sounds kind of European, don't you think?
<p>Daria - Uh, did you guys read this letter?
<p>Helen - Yes, and it says right there that she's in.
<p>Daria - And here at the bottom it also says, "Manatee College has no classes, but offers beachfront accommodations at a cost of $10,000 per semester."
<p>Quinn - That's even better than we thought, right, Dad?
<p>Jake - Give me that! <i>(grabs letter and reads, his good mood evaporating)</i>
<p><i>(doorbell rings)</i>
<p><i>(Jake and Helen answer the door; the college geek is on the stoop, holding an envelope)</i>
<p>Geek - Hi, sir. This is something for your daughter, Daria. She wrote a paper for me.
<p>Jake - And she made you pay in cash?
<p>Geek - Yes, sir.
<p>Jake - <i>(to Helen)</i> Good girl.
<p>Helen - Jake!
<p>Geek - Hi, ma'am! Remember me?
<p>Helen - No! <i>(slams door)</i>
<p><i>(at Pizza King)</i>
<p><i>(Daria and Jane are eating pizza by the window)</i>
<p>Daria - By the way, do you mind paying for this? I'm broke.
<p>Jane - What happened to all your paper-writing money?
<p>Daria - My mom wouldn't let me keep it. She said it was wrong to encourage cheaters and to profit from them.
<p>Jane - So, she's giving up being a lawyer?
<p>Daria - I asked her that, and I'm sure some day we'll once again be on speaking terms.
<p>Jane - All in all, then, the whole college experience kind of sucked.
<p>Daria - Pretty much.
<p>Jane - Does that mean <i>these</i> are the best years of our lives?
<p>Daria - I hope not.
<p>Quinn - Uh!
<p><i>(Daria and Jane glance over to find Quinn throwing a soda in the college class instructor's face)</i>
<p>Quinn - I should have known Daria was right about that making-out scholarship! <i>(leaves)</i>
<p>Daria - But you've gotta admit, there are some pretty choice moments.
