<p><i>(opening theme song)</i>
<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(everyone is seated around the kitchen table, except for Jake, who's in mid-rant)</i>
<p>Jake - A hundred miles? To go to a mall? Dammit, there's a mall five minutes away!
<p>Helen - Sit down, dear. We're not going.
<p>Jake - Ohhhhh. Oh. <i>(sits in chair)</i>
<p>Quinn - It's not a mall, it's a super mall! The Mall of the Millennium. Shop there forever!
<p>Daria - If you play that John Lennon song backwards, it says, "Imagine all the people, browsing in a mall." Isn't that weird?
<p>Helen - It's too far away, Quinn, and you've done enough shopping for this quarter.
<p>Quinn - Muh-<i>om!</i> As vice president of the Fashion Club, I need to know what's out there!
<p>Jake - Vice president? Did you know she was vice president, Helen?
<p>Helen - Yes, Jake.
<p>Jake - Of the Fashion Club!
<p>Helen - Yes, Jake. Vice president of the Fashion Club.
<p>Jake - Do you think this tie works? <i>(holds tie out for Quinn's inspection)</i>
<p>Quinn - Hmmm. <i>(holds tie in hand)</i> It's nice, Daddy, but I think a mandarin collar would really set off your strong jaw line. Now, if you drive me to the Mall of the Millennium...
<p>Helen - No more malls until you bring up your grade point average.
<p>Jake - Exactly. What's wrong with her grade point average?
<p>Quinn - How will I hold my head up in the Fashion Club?
<p>Daria - A traction pulley?
<p>Quinn - Just because <i>you're</i> not interested in what's new and attractive and popular...
<p>Daria - Oh, I'm interested. But why go a mere 100 miles away? I bet they have some fascinating malls in Southeast Asia.
<p>Jake - Southeast Asia? To go to a mall? Dammit!
<p>Helen - Sit down, dear. It was a joke.
<p>Jake - Ohhhhh. Oh.
<p><i>(at Lawndale High School)</i>
<p><i>(in Economics class, Mrs. Bennett is drawing one of her infamous incomprehensible diagrams)</i>
<p>Mrs. Bennett - In economics, we call this flow. We have a scenario of supply and demand, where a new demand is created by a previous supply. Does everyone follow? <i>(pause)</i> Can anyone give me a concrete representation of this abstract theory? <i>(long pause, then sigh)</i> Daria?
<p>Daria - If we're talking concrete, I'd have to go with that repository of human greed and debasement: the mall.
<p>Mrs. Bennett - Very good, Daria. The mall is a very beautiful illustration of all these economic principles. In fact, it would make for an excellent field trip.
<p>Kevin - All right! Field trip! <i>(leans over to Daria)</i> Where are we going, man?
<p>Daria - The field.
<p>Kevin - Cool.
<p>Mrs. Bennett - We'll visit that brand new Mall of the Millennium. It's a perfect emblem of a modern day economic structure.
<p>Daria - Um, I think that's a really bad idea.
<p>Mrs. Bennett - Don't be silly, Daria. It's your idea and it's perfect.
<p>Jane - I second Daria. The mall is a dangerous influence on today's teens and the fluorescent lights give you seizures.
<p>Mrs. Bennett - We'll take a vote. All in favor of a class trip to the mall next Friday instead of our usual surprise quiz?
<p><i>(everyone but Daria and Jane cheer)</i>
<p>Mrs. Bennett - All opposed?
<p><i>(Daria and Jane raise their hands)</i>
<p>Brittany - This is great! Kevin and I love going to the mall during school. <i>(Mrs. Bennett frowns)</i> I mean, between classes. I mean... what do I mean, babe?
<p>Kevin - What's the difference, babe? You look hot.
<p>Daria - I'm sorry, Mrs. Bennett. I can't go to the mall. I have a skin condition.
<p>Mrs. Bennett - What are you talking about, Daria?
<p>Daria - If I'm in an enclosed space for too long, I get hives.
<p>Mrs. Bennett - But you're in an enclosed space now.
<p>Daria - Yes... and I'm really itchy?
<p>Jane - These hives get bad, Mrs. Bennett, I've seen them. They drip with puss.
<p><i>(class reacts with revulsion and Daria glares at Jane)</i>
<p>Jane - Just trying to help.
<p><i>(on the school bus)</i>
<p>Kevin - <i>(sings)</i> Seventy eight bottles of beer on the wall, seventy eight bottles of beer! If one of those bottles should happen to fall, seventy-seven bottles of...
<p>Brittany - Babe? That's a really cute song and all, but do you think you could stop for a while?
<p>Kevin - Sorry, babe. We always sing that song on the team bus. It makes us fierce!
<p>Brittany - You're not on the team bus now. I'm not your teammate. I'm your girlfriend! We talked about the difference, remember?
<p>Kevin - Sorry...
<p>Brittany - Would you rather do what we do... with your teammates?
<p>Kevin - Blah!
<p>Brittany - All right, then.
<p><i>(Kevin starts humming the song, and Brittany hits him)</i>
<p><i>(Mrs. Bennett stands in front of the bus, lecturing the students)</i>
<p>Mrs. Bennett - Sealed in glass though it may be, in its own way the mall can be viewed as a living organism.
<p>Kevin - Mack Daddy, did you hear what Mrs. B just called the mall?
<p>Mack - She said "organism." That's not the same as "orgasm." And stop me calling that, okay?
<p>Kevin - Babe, did you hear what Mrs. B called the mall?
<p>Brittany - Yeah...
<p><i>(Kevin and Brittany start to make out; Jodie and Mack endure the uncomfortable noises as best they can)</i>
<p>Jodie - Do you think it would dishonor Dr. King's memory if I went to sit in the back of the bus?
<p>Mack - At least he's not singing.
<p><i>(Kevin hums song while making out with Brittany)</i>
<p><i>(Upchuck approaches a seat with two girls)</i>
<p>Upchuck - Hey, sweet baby, how'd you like to spend some do-re-me, huh? I need some models for this... um...
<p><i>(girl crosses arms and looks away)</i>
<p>Upchuck - Sorry.
<p><i>(Upchuck goes to Jane and Daria)</i>
<p>Upchuck - Ladies! Are you aware of the advantages of a gold card? <i>(he shows them a credit card)</i> Very advantageous when it belongs to your father. Dad wants me to pick up some bikinis for his secretary. <i>(short laugh)</i> But I need a couple of models. The two of you are about her size. What do you say, gals?
<p>Jane - Upchuck, are you aware that many therapists now accept credit cards? <i>(pause)</i> Daria?
<p>Daria - I feel sick. Can someone open a window?
<p><i>(Jane attempts to open window and fails)</i>
<p>Upchuck - Allow me, fair maiden.
<p><i>(Upchuck reaches past and grunts while trying to open window, but also fails; he continues to try through Daria and Jane's conversation)</i>
<p>Jane - I didn't know you got car sick.
<p>Daria - I don't, usually. It's the fumes. It smells like... it smells like...
<p>Jane - Teen spirit?
<p>Daria - Cheap perfume.
<p>Jane - Brittany must be working up a sweat.
<p>Mrs. Bennett - The modern day mall evolved when shopkeepers, a.k.a. merchants, discovered the benefits to joining economic forces. <i>(bus hits rough spot on road and jostles Mrs. Bennett)</i> Um, where was I?
<p><i>(pan to Kevin and Brittany, who are now decidedly mussed up)</i>
<p>Brittany - Mrs. B! Mrs. B!
<p>Mrs. Bennett - What, Brittany?
<p>Brittany - Do you mind if we do a cheer?
<p>Mrs. Bennett - Um, go ahead, Brittany.
<p>Kevin - Hey! How about a hundred bottles of... <i>(Brittany hits him)</i>
<p><i>(Brittany stands at front of bus with pom poms)</i>
<p>Brittany - Okay everybody, let's make it a keeper! <i>(chants)</i> "Where are we going? The mall! What are we spending? Money! Money! Mall! Mall! Money! Mall! Mall! Money! Go class!" <i>(leaps up and lands doing a split)</i>
<p>Kevin - Yeah!
<p><i>(at the Mall of the Millennium)</i>
<p><i>(parking lot tram pulls away from school bus)</i>
<p>Announcer <i>(VO)</i> - Welcome to the Mall of the Millennium, the world's second or third largest mall...
<p><i>(pan to Kevin and Brittany; Brittany suddenly reacts)</i>
<p>Brittany - Kevin, not now, okay?
<p>Kevin - Not now what, babe?
<p><i>(Brittany turns and scowls at a leering Upchuck, who's obviously copped a feel)</i>
<p><i>(pan to Daria and Jane; Daria is very, very green around the gills)</i>
<p>Daria - I think I'm going to be sick.
<p>Jane - Um, could it possibly wait?
<p><i>(tram stops at front of Mall, accompanied by various "ooohs!" and "aaahs!" as passengers begin exiting the tram)</i>
<p>Daria - I know I'm going to be sick.
<p><i>(she then doubles over and vomits onto the pavement, with Jane looking on dispassionately)</i>
<p>Jane - <i>Bienvenidos</i> a la Mall of the Millennium.

<p><hr>

<p><i>(at the Mall of the Millennium)</i>
<p><i>(Mrs. Bennett is trying to read a map while addressing the class; kids can be heard screaming as cars from the indoor rollercoaster speed past them)</i>
<p>Mrs. Bennett - We're in area B, section Pink, and we need to get to area C, section Orange. So, if we just bear right at area L, section Blue... oh, wait, sorry. Wrong level.
<p>Kevin - Look, Mack Daddy! The Sports Shorts! A whole store full of shorts for sports!
<p>Mack - Uh-huh.
<p><i>(Mrs. Bennett walks with class while reading the map)</i>
<p>Mrs. Bennett - Everyone, we'll walk down R Moss, and turn right at Q Canary. Please keep the flow, people, please keep the flow.
<p>Brittany - Who would ever guess there'd be so many colors? The person who thought them all up must be a genius.
<p>Jane - Yeah, and we haven't even gotten to puke green yet. <i>(glances at Daria, who still looks queasy)</i> Oh, yeah.
<p>Mrs. Bennett - Left at N Cranberry. Wait, is that cranberry or magenta? Jane, you're an artist.
<p>Jane - It's cranapple.
<p>Upchuck - Mrs. B? Can we please stop for a minute at Bikini Island? I'd like to buy a few trifles for the ladies, and perhaps you'd care to pick out something for yourself?
<p>Mrs. Bennett - Not now, Charles. We'll be late for our meeting with the mall executives. I had to work very hard to arrange this. These are very important, very busy... oh, oh, oooooh!
<p>Upchuck - What is it, Mrs. B?
<p><i>(Mrs. Bennett runs to a storefront and looks in)</i>
<p>Mrs. Bennett - The Fuzzy Wuzzy Wee-Bit Shop! Herbert and I collect Fuzzy Wuzzy Wee Bits! Aren't they adorable? Look, a Fuzzy Wuzzy Wee Bits cactus! And look at that little bunny rabbit with its own Fuzzy Wuzzy carrot! <i>(laughs)</i>
<p><i>(in a conference room, three mall executives talk to the students gathered around large table; one wall of the room is mirrored)</i>
<p>Executive - And of course, when you go to the mall, you look for what?
<p>Upchuck - Bikinis! Make that lovely, luscious, ladies in bikinis!
<p>Kevin - Yeah... <i>(Brittany hits him)</i> Ow!
<p>Upchuck - <i>(growls)</i> Feisty!
<p>Jane - I always look for security guards leading away someone in handcuffs. Shoplifters are the best judges of merchandise.
<p>Executive - I meant more along the line of the qualities you look for? The stores? What should they be like?
<p><i>(Brittany isn't paying attention; instead, she's posing in front of the mirrored wall)</i>
<p>Brittany - Perky... a little bouncy... not too bouncy...
<p>Executive - What?
<p>Brittany - <i>(jolted back to reality)</i> What?
<p>Jodie - I have a question. Do you think our demographic can really be addressed by middle-aged middle managers telling us what's fun to buy?
<p><i>(the executives are silent; they obviously never expected to deal with a kid in possession of a functioning brain)</i>
<p>Executive - How about you? How many times a year do you go to the mall?
<p>Daria - Don't people usually get paid for participating in market research?
<p>Executive <i>(in strangled voice)</i> - Research?
<p>Mrs. Bennett - Now, Daria, these busy executives have been nice enough to give their time to help educate us on mall economics. Tell us about flow, would you?
<p>Executive - Okay.
<p>Daria - I bet that's a two-way mirror.
<p>Jane - You mean, if you turn out the lights you can see through it?
<p><i>(Jane reaches back toward a light switch)</i>
<p>Executive - Oh, you don't want to do that.
<p><i>(Jane turns off the lights; with the room darkened, three observers can be seen through the two-way mirrored wall)</i>
<p><i>(the executive turns the lights back on amidst murmuring from the students, who have begun to realize what's going on)</i>
<p>Executive - The focus group is, um, a very important tool in mall management. We thought that with this live demonstration... <i>(nervous laugh)</i>
<p>Jodie - I feel used. I feel abused. I feel that this is not a fun mall after all and the media should be made aware of it.
<p>Executive - All right, little lady. <i>(reaches into vest pocket)</i> Here's a coupon for a free frozen yogurt.
<p>Jodie - Don't insult me.
<p>Executive - <i>(reaches into pocket again)</i> Make it a ten dollar merchandise coupon?
<p>Jane - You're still insulting her.
<p><i>(executive holds up two handfuls of coupons)</i>
<p>Executive - Okay, a twenty dollar merchandise coupon for everyone in the class.
<p>Daria - You don't get it. There's a principle involved.
<p>Jodie - No, there isn't. <i>(joins other students in getting coupons)</i>
<p>Daria - So much for idealistic youth.
<p>Jane - That's twenty bucks! <i>(goes and gets her own coupon)</i>
<p><i>(students in mall corridor, looking at coupons)</i>
<p>Kevin - Books By the Ton. "The country's biggest bookstore?" Aw, man!
<p>Upchuck - The Sports Shorts?
<p>Kevin - Aww!
<p>Jane - Scissor Wizard. I can actually use a new pair of scissors. Here, I got one for you. <i>(hands coupon to Daria)</i>
<p>Daria - The Doo Dad Shop. Oh, good. I've always wanted my own doo dad.
<p>Mrs. Bennett - Daria and Jane, you'll observe traffic patterns at the food concessions, and Kevin and Brittany, you will study and report back on shrinkage.
<p>Kevin - What's shrinkage?
<p>Mrs. Bennett - Shrinkage is the retailing term for shoplifting. I'd like you to analyze its economic impact. Does everyone else understand their assignments? <i>(various murmurs of assent)</i> Now, we'll meet back here at quarter to three. Remember, area F, section Moss, level three. Got it? F Moss Three.
<p>Kevin - I know a good way to remember that.
<p>Mrs. Bennett - You have a mnemonic device, Kevin?
<p>Kevin - It's not an S&amp;M thing, Mrs. B. It's just a way to remember that.
<p>Mrs. Bennett - Let's hear it.
<p>Kevin - Fmossthree. Fmossthree! Get it? Fmossthree! Or was it Fmosstwo?
<p>Mrs. Bennett - Everyone, write it down!
<p><i>(at the food court, Daria and Jane stand and observe the crowd)</i>
<p>Jane - Traffic patterns at the food concessions.
<p>Daria - Hmm. I've noticed a pattern. People walk in looking hungry.
<p>Jane - And leave, stuffing their face.
<p>Daria - Assignment completed.
<p>Jane - Now, for extra credit, let's experience the traffic pattern for ourselves.
<p><i>(the Fashion Club and a boy are seated at a food court table)</i>
<p>Quinn - I know! A makeover project! We'll find some hideously out of style nobody and make her look as good as us. <i>(pausing at a glare from Sandi)</i> Almost.
<p>Sandi - That's so great, Quinn. I wish <i>I'd</i> had such a brilliant idea. You guys should impeach me and make Quinn president!
<p>Quinn - Oh, Sandi, I never would have had that idea if it weren't for you. You said, "the Fashion Club should do more for the community." You're a great leader.
<p>Sandi - That's 'cause you guys are such great leadettes.
<p>Stacy - So we'll find, like, a loser poster girl, to show that we really, like, do stuff for people.
<p>Tiffany - But if we do posters, shouldn't we be on them?
<p>Sandi - We can have a fundraiser to buy her makeup.
<p>Stacy - Cool, a party!
<p>Guy - Can I come?
<p>Quinn - Listen, um, guy, why don't you just wait in the car for us?
<p>Guy - But you said if I drove you I could hang out with you.
<p>Quinn - Oh, all right! But don't try to participate, okay? We're in the middle of a meeting.
<p>Stacy - Look! They'd be perfect! <i>(points to two girls, one in green and one in red; you can't see their faces, but they look very familiar...)</i>
<p>Tiffany - Wow, you're right. They need help.
<p><i>(Fashion Club begins walking over to the mystery girls)</i>
<p>Quinn - Especially the one on the left. She really needs volumizer. And maybe some subtle streaks.
<p>Sandi - And a little skort set. Have you seen the new skorts? Really cute.
<p>Stacy - Is it a skirt or is it shorts? I love that.
<p>Tiffany - I wonder if they make skorts for sports!
<p><i>(Quinn taps the girl in green on the shoulder; she turns around, and to no one's surprise except Quinn's, it's Daria)</i>
<p>Quinn - Aaaaahhh!
<p>Daria - <i>(smirks)</i> Good to see you, too.

<p><hr>

<p><i>(Daria, Jane, and Fashion Club in mall food court)</i>
<p>Daria - Well. What an unexpected opportunity for sibling bonding.
<p>Quinn - I'm going to be sick.
<p>Jane - Is that, like, a family thing?
<p>Quinn <i>(to Fashion Club)</i> - Just one sec, guys. I'm interviewing our first makeover candidate.
<p><i>(Daria, Jane, and Quinn walk away from rest of Fashion Club)</i>
<p>Daria - I'm sure Mom and Dad will be really pleased to hear I ran into you. Here at the mall. On this lovely school day.
<p>Quinn - Okay, state your terms.
<p>Daria - It's weird. I can't think of anything I'd want... from <i>you.</i>
<p>Quinn - <i>(half-heartedly)</i> How about a free makeover?
<p>Daria - No, thanks... but, I wouldn't mind taking it easy around the house for a month.
<p>Quinn - A <i>month?!?</i>
<p>Jane - I'd hold out for cold cash.
<p>Daria - Or you can just never set foot inside a mall for the rest of your sorry adolescent life. And a ride home from your little friend would be great. Jane and I really aren't in the mood to take the bus back.
<p>Quinn - Ugh! Fine! Meet us in an hour on level five, area D, section Lavender.
<p>Daria - You got that?
<p>Jane - Dlavenderfive. Dlavenderfive. Nothing to it.
<p><i>(Fashion Club and guy walk away)</i>
<p>Guy - Who was that girl?
<p>Quinn - Look, you were hired to drive, not speak, okay?
<p><i>(Daria and Jane walk through the mall)</i>
<p>Jane - You got us a ride home. Cool.
<p>Daria - No, I blew it. I should've made them drive Upchuck home.
<p><i>(they stop in front of Scissor Wizard)</i>
<p>Jane - Hey, look. I can use my coupon.
<p><i>(they enter Scissor Wizard, and discover it's a hair salon)</i>
<p>Hairdresser - You got here just in time. <i>(looks at Daria)</i> You're almost in time.
<p>Jane - I've got this coupon. <i>(hairdresser leads her to a chair)</i> But I just wanted a pair of scissors.
<p>Hairdresser - We don't sell scissors, we cut hair. Which show?
<p>Jane - What?
<p>Hairdresser - Which TV show do you want your style from? Most of our clients go for a sitcom. Although, you're more the "movie of the week" type. I have a <u>TV Guide</u> if you want to browse.
<p>Jane - Have you ever seen <i>Sick, Sad World</i>?
<p>Hairdresser - No.
<p>Daria - How about <i>Animal Maulings</i> on home video?
<p>Jane - Yeah, I'd love to have hair like that woman who was molested by the kangaroo.
<p>Daria - Really? She looks so every day.
<p>Jane - I mean, after she was molested.
<p>Daria - Ohhhh.
<p>Jane - Make sure you get, like, the big clods of dirt and stuff in it.
<p>Hairdresser - Listen, um, maybe you girls should come back another time. My next appointment's here.
<p>Jane - What about my coupon? <i>(hairdresser hands her a can)</i> Mousse?
<p>Daria - Hey, how about that guy who was trampled by the moose?
<p>Jane - Nah, his hair was too bloody.
<p><i>(outside the Scissor Wizard)</i>
<p>Jane - Nice of her to buy that coupon back for cash. Let's do yours next.
<p>Daria - I'm really not in the market for a doo dad.
<p>Jane - Come on. Let's at least find out what a doo dad is.
<p><i>(Daria and Jane stand in front of the Doo Dad Shop)</i>
<p>Jane - What is this stuff?
<p>Daria - Who would buy such crappy, useless junk?
<p><i>(Brittany and Kevin come out of the store)</i>
<p>Kevin - Fmossthree. Fmossthree. <i>(sings)</i> Hundred bottles of beer on the wall... hundred bottles of beer...
<p>Brittany - Did you see the cute little thingy with the cute thingy?
<p>Kevin - I got it for you, babe.
<p>Brittany - Oh, Kev, this is the first cute thingy that you've bought me since... wait... you didn't steal this, did you?
<p>Kevin - It was shrinkage, babe!
<p><i>(Brittany angrily drags Kevin back into the store)</i>
<p><i>(Jane walks into the store, followed by Daria; a bell goes off and the staff rushes up to Daria, giving her a bundle of balloons)</i>
<p>Staff - <i>(singing)</i> When your feeling bad or mad or sad, buy a doo dad! You'll feel glad! It's not too sad, to buy a doo dad, today!
<p>Jane - What are you doing to my friend?
<p><i>(store manager has given Daria an armload of merchandise)</i>
<p>Manager - You're our lucky ten-thousandth customer. All these doo dads are yours for free! <i>(pause)</i> Don't you get it? You're our winner!
<p>Daria <i>(shocked)</i> - Winner?
<p>Jane - You know, it's not a word for loser.
<p>Photographer - On three, everyone... "I love doo dads!" One... two... three...
<p>Staff - I love doo dads!
<p><i>(photographer takes picture)</i>
<p><i>(guy drives car, carrying Daria, Jane and Fashion Club; car stops at Lane house and Jane exits front, then stops at Morgendorffer house; Daria exits front)</i>
<p>Daria - Thanks for the ride, um, guy.
<p><i>(Quinn exits and has difficulty walking after sitting in the cramped back seat with the rest of the Fashion Club)</i>
<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(Jake, Helen, and Daria area seated at the kitchen table, with Quinn picking up dirty plates)</i>
<p>Helen - Thank you, sweetheart. You've become so considerate these past couple of weeks.
<p>Daria - And I bet she stays that way for another couple of weeks.
<p>Jake - That was delicious. Anyone else want a cup of coffee?
<p>Quinn - Let me, Dad. <i>(sighs)</i> Let me.
<p>Jack - Should we tell them?
<p>Helen - Lets.
<p>Jake - Girls...
<p>Helen - I was a little hard on you the other day, Quinn, so Dad and I thought it would be fun to take you to a movie at the new Super Mega Multiplex. And Daria, after the movie we'll stop at Books By the Ton. It's the biggest bookstore in the country.
<p>Jake - You know, at the Mall of the Millennium.
<p><i>(both girls definitely look less than enthused)</i>
<p>Daria - <i>(flatly)</i> Great.
<p>Quinn - <i>(flatly)</i> Yeah, great.
<p><i>(Daria and Quinn exit)</i>
<p>Helen - Did you think they'd be more excited?
<p>Jake - Oh, you know Daria, she loves to act cool. Once we're there, wait until you see her face then!
