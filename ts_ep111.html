<p><i>(opening theme song)</i>
<p><i>(at the Lane house)</i>
<p><i>(close-up on TV screen showing a cigarette-smoking monkey pounding on a computer keyboard)</i>
<p>SSW Announcer - Can monkeys surf the net... and corrupt our kids? Chimpanzee chat rooms, next on <i>Sick, Sad World</i>.
<p><i>(pull back to reveal Daria seated on Jane's bed, remote control in hand; suddenly, a glue gun appears, aimed at her head)</i>
<p>Daria - Put down your weapon. I surrender.
<p><i>(pull back to reveal that Jane, of course, is holding the glue gun; she's been working on several sculptures)</i>
<p>Jane - A little respect for the Stickmata 5000. Finest glue gun on the market.
<p>Daria - And I thought you were on your way to a sci-fi convention.
<p>Jane - <i>(kneeling)</i> No, thanks. Reality is bizarre enough for me. <i>(glues objects onto sculptures)</i> Why do I get so much fun out of this?
<p>Daria - Past life as a barnacle? <i>(reaches out to touch one of the sculptures)</i>
<p>Jane - Don't touch! It took hours to build. It's the subject of a painting.
<p>Daria - You're going to end up one of those old ladies who build their houses out of bottles, aren't you.
<p><i>(suddenly, the loud sound of a guitar shakes room and cause the sculpture that Daria was about to touch to collapse)</i>
<p>Daria - There goes your genius grant.
<p>Jane - Yeah, but maybe Trent will share his with me.
<p>Daria - That's Trent?
<p>Jane - <i>(gets up)</i> Come on, Daria. Let's go complain about the noise, hmm?
<p>Daria - I don't find it a problem. Um, I have unusually sturdy eardrums?
<p>Jane - I think Trent's band might have an opening for a fly girl. <i>(grabs Daria by the arm as she leaves the room)</i>
<p>Daria - I think <i>I</i> might have an opening for a new friend.
<p><i>(they descend into the basement as another guitar riff shakes the house, only this time there are two distinct guitar sounds)</i>
<p>Daria - Isn't that two guitars?
<p>Jane - Yeah. The other one's Jesse. He plays rhythm in Mystik Spiral.
<p>Daria - "Mystik Spiral"?
<p>Jane - Trent's band.
<p>Daria - Sounds like one of those Doors cover bands that play brew pubs.
<p>Jane - Heh, they wish!
<p><i>(Trent and Jesse start playing guitars; they aren't exactly Jimmy Page and Jimi Hendrix)</i>
<p>Trent - <i>(singing)</i> "You're an angel in black / You sure have a knack / For putting my heart on a shelf in the back / I'm waiting my turn / Oh, when will I learn? / My poor heart, you're giving it freezer burn. Yeah..."
<p><i>(they resume playing; it hasn't improved)</i>
<p>Jane - Yo, Trent! <i>(guitar playing stops)</i> You wanna turn it down a bit?
<p>Trent - Are you kidding? Hey, Daria.
<p>Daria - <i>(VO)</i> Can't speak... must speak... <i>(spoken)</i> Hey.
<p>Trent - Whadda ya think of the song?
<p>Daria - <i>(VO)</i> It has a beat and you can dance to it, if you have no shame. <i>(spoken)</i> Cool.
<p>Trent - It's called "Icebox Woman."
<p>Jesse - You guys oughta come to the next Mystik Spiral gig. We'll put you on the list.
<p>Jane - Daria thinks the name Mystik Spiral sounds like a Doors cover band that plays brew pubs. Don't ya, Daria?
<p>Daria - That's not exactly what I...
<p>Trent - Hmmm... maybe you're right. Would it help if we spelled mystik with two Y's?
<p>Daria - <i>(VO)</i> And I'll spell my name D-A-R-Y-A and be crowned Miss America. <i>(spoken)</i> It might.
<p>Jesse - We doing a show this weekend?
<p>Trent - Nah, we're going to Alternapalooza this weekend.
<p>Jane - You're going to Alternapalooza?
<p>Jesse - Yeah. It's way out in Swedesville.
<p>Jane - You think your car will make it?
<p>Jesse - We're borrowing our drummer's van, the Tank. It's indestructible.
<p>Trent - Yeah, but you know, Jess, it eats gas. I don't know what we're going to do for gas money.
<p>Jane - I could probably scrounge some up, if you let us come along. We'd enjoy that, wouldn't we, Daria?
<p>Daria - <i>(VO)</i> Pass me a guitar string so that I might silence my friend. <i>(spoken)</i> Uh-huh.
<p>Trent - Okay, cool, we're there. If you can stand being cooped up in a van with Jesse and me for four hours.
<p><i>(Daria now looks like a deer frozen in a car's headlights)</i>
<p><i>(at Cashman's Department Store)</i>
<p><i>(the Fashion Club members are examining clothes for "alternative" fashions, in preparation for Alternapalooza)</i>
<p>Sandi - Friends don't let short-waisted friends wear hip-huggers.
<p>Stacy - <i>(holds up dress with a security tag attached)</i> I hate these big plastic things. They're so ugly!
<p>Quinn - If <i>I</i> were gonna shoplift, I wouldn't take <i>that</i> cheap thing.
<p>Sandi - Quinn, cheap is in this season.
<p>Quinn - Oh, then get it, definitely.
<p>Tiffany - Why are we going to Alternapalooza? Ugh. Isn't that for girls who don't shave?
<p>Sandi - As members of the Fashion Club, we have to keep up with the latest trends in music and clothes.
<p>Quinn - And show everyone that popular kids can be as alternative as geeks.
<p>Tiffany - <i>(holds up an outfit)</i> Is this alternative?
<p>Sandi - If you tuck the top in, no. If you let it hang out, yes.
<p>Quinn - Do I have to wear clunky shoes?
<p>Sandi - <i>(sighs)</i> When you wear big shoes, the rest of you looks even cuter by comparison.
<p>Quinn - Oh. I get it. Maybe I'll shave my head!
<p><i>(everyone laughs)</i>
<p>Tiffany - You crack me up, Quinn.
<p>Quinn - Look, temporary tattoos. Woo-hoo!
<p><i>(Sandi looks, then nods in approval)</i>
<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(the family is sitting around the kitchen table)</i>
<p>Helen - Quinn, what is that thing on your arm? <i>(points at tattoo on Quinn's arm)</i>
<p>Quinn - Don't worry, Mom. It's fake.
<p>Daria - Aww, you got a tattoo to match your personality.
<p>Quinn - I'm going to Alternapalooza this weekend. This is so I'll fit in.
<p>Daria - And if some guy named Pigpen asks you to be his old lady, hell, you'll be ready.
<p>Quinn - I'm also thinking of having my belly button pierced at the mall...
<p>Jake - What? No daughter of mine is going to mutilate her body for the sake of some fad!
<p>Quinn - Then can I have $29.95 for a removable nose ring? No piercing required!
<p>Daria - Good idea. You don't need any more holes in your head.
<p>Helen - Daria...
<p>Quinn - Hey, Mom, did you go to any festivals back in the sixties?
<p>Helen - Oh, sure. I did my share of partying.
<p>Daria - You mean you experimented with...
<p>Helen - No! Your father went to one of the most famous festivals of the decade.
<p>Quinn - Woodstock?
<p>Jake - Altamont! Terrible tragedy, but I demanded my money back and I got it.
<p>Daria - Wasn't Altamont free?
<p>Jake - <i>(laughs)</i> That's the same line they tried to use on me.
<p><i>(in Quinn's room, Quinn is trying on different outfits, tossing various rejected clothes all over her room)</i>
<p><i>(in Daria's room, Daria opens her closet to show it's almost empty)</i>
<p><i>(back in Quinn's room, Quinn is posing in front of her mirror when Daria enters, clad in jeans and a black T-shirt)</i>
<p>Daria - Where'd you get that eye-popping polyester number?
<p>Quinn - Daria, it's all about knowing where to shop. <i>(sees Daria's outfit)</i> Wow, you look almost normal. Is this some kind of trick?
<p>Daria - No. I'm going to Alternapalooza.
<p>Quinn - <i>(panics)</i> Ah!
<p>Daria - Don't panic. I think we'll be able to lose each other in a crowd of ten thousand.
<p>Quinn - I guess. You're not going to Alternapalooza with that top tucked in, are you?
<p><i>(in the living room, Jake and Helen area seated on a sofa when Daria enters; her T-shirt is no longer tucked into her jeans)</i>
<p>Helen - Have fun at the concert dear.
<p>Daria - Um, thanks.
<p>Jake - <i>(laughs)</i> Hey, stay away from the brown...
<p>Helen - Jake!
<p>Jake - Remember, Daria: just say no. Here's a twenty, for souvenirs or what have you. I gave one to Quinn, too. Get yourself something rad.
<p>Daria - <i>(takes bill)</i> Thanks. Uh, what are you guys gonna do today?
<p>Helen - Pay the bills.
<p>Jake - Wash the cars.
<p>Daria - Wow. Well, remember to take plenty of rest breaks and stay hydrated. Bye.
<p><i>(Daria exits; Helen and Jake run to the window to watch her leave)</i>

<p><hr>

<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(outside, Daria and Jane wait for Trent and Jesse to arrive)</i>
<p>Jane - <i>(faux French accent)</i> Oooh, la la. Is that lipstick?
<p><i>(Daria covers her mouth with her hand)</i>
<p>Daria - I just had a lollipop.
<p>Jane - Sure you did, kid.
<p><i>(the Tank pulls up and stops; Trent is driving, Jesse is in the passenger seat)</i>
<p>Trent - Ready? Sorry, there's only two seats up here, but there's plenty of space in the back.
<p>Jane - <i>(opens sliding door)</i> Daria, why don't you sit in front with Trent?
<p>Daria - Oh, I'd much rather be in the back with you, Jane. <i>(sotto voce)</i> Easier to get to your neck.
<p>Jesse - Girl talk, huh?
<p>Jane - You know Daria. She's a regular chatterbox.
<p><i>(Jane sits on a steamer trunk; Daria bumps her head getting in, closes the door, and sits beside Jane on the trunk)</i>
<p>Trent - Watch your head.
<p><i>(the Tank drives off; moments later, a yellow convertible parks in the driveway and a Jeep parks at the curb)</i>
<p><i>(Joey, Jeffy, and Jamie get out of the convertible and walk up to the front door)</i>
<p>Joey - You know the problem with alternative bands?
<p>Jeffy - Uh, they're a bunch of cry-babies who suck at sports?
<p>Joey - Yeah!
<p><i>(Jamie rings doorbell while all three laugh)</i>
<p>Jamie - Ya think the chicks at this thing will be pierced?
<p>Joey - Piercing is so stupid.
<p>Jeffy - It's bad enough when they have braces.
<p><i>(Quinn opens the door; she's sporting a nose ring)</i>
<p>Jamie - Cool nose ring, Quinn!
<p>Jeffy - You look really alternative!
<p>Joey - Yeah, I never realized your nose was so... hot!
<p><i>(inside the Tank)</i>
<p>Jane - <i>("tough girl" accent)</i> - Yo, hi. I'm Dolores. I'm doing ten to fifteen for armed robbery. What are you in for?
<p>Daria - My head hurts.
<p>Jane - <i>(still with the accent)</i> The cops did that to you, didn't they? Bastards.
<p><i>(the Tank pulls up to a toll booth)</i>
<p>Trent - Hey, Jane, got any change?
<p>Jane - Hey, Trent, got any shame? I already gave you all my cash.
<p><i>(Trent digs change from pocket and pays toll before driving away)</i>
<p>Jesse - Oh, man. That was Curtis Stalano.
<p>Jane - Who?
<p>Trent - He graduated with us. Now he's working in a toll booth. Whoa.
<p>Jesse - You'd never catch me in a job like that.
<p>Daria <i>(VO)</i> - Because it falls under the category of employment.
<p>Trent - Hey man, we're artists. Who knows where we'll be in five years.
<p>Daria <i>(VO)</i> - Still living over your parent's garage?
<p>Jane <i>(loud whisper)</i> - Say it, Daria. Whatever you're thinking, say it. If you don't, they'll go on like this for hours.
<p>Jesse - We've got a vision.
<p>Trent - Eyes on the prize, man. Eyes on the prize.
<p>Jesse - Yeah, and this guy's not about selling out.
<p>Trent - No way.
<p>Jane - 'Cause for that to happen, you'd need someone interested in buying. <i>(pause)</i> Well, someone had to pick up the slack!
<p><i>(they drive past a billboard advertising new homes for sale)</i>
<p>Trent - <i>(reading billboard)</i> "If you lived here, you'd be home by now."
<p>Daria - And bored out of your mind. <i>(raises hand to mouth when she realizes she blurted that one out)</i>
<p><i>(Trent and Jesse laugh)</i>
<p>Trent - Good one, Daria.
<p><i>(the Tank speeds up and swerves to pass a slow-moving car)</i>
<p>Daria - Can somebody open up a window, please?
<p>Trent - Wish I could. All the handles are missing.
<p><i>(the Tank goes over bump, knocking Daria and Jane off trunk)</i>
<p>Trent - Whoa. <i>(short laugh)</i> Didn't see that one coming.
<p>Jane - <i>(peeved)</i> Let us know if you <i>do</i> see one coming.
<p>Jesse - Anybody else smell peanut butter?
<p>Daria - What am I sitting on?
<p><i>(Daria turns to face away from Jane, who peels a sandwich off of Daria's butt)</i>
<p>Jane - Looks like a sandwich... and it's an antique!
<p><i>(elsewhere on the road, Kevin is driving his jeep, Brittany is talking on a cellphone in the passenger seat, while Jodie and Mack sit in the back seat)</i>
<p>Brittany - <i>(into phone)</i> I can't believe it! Gordon and Victoria? She's six inches taller than him! What's she thinking?
<p><i>(Brittany lashes arm out in surprise, hitting Kevin and causing the Jeep to swerve)</i>
<p><i>(meanwhile, back in the Tank, a bee flies around inside)</i>
<p>Jesse - That peanut butter is making me hungry.
<p>Jane - Killer bee alert!
<p>Daria - Great.
<p>Jane - Hey, Jesse, hand me that map?
<p><i>(Jesse hands her a rolled up-map; cut to view of Trent and Jesse)</i>
<p>Jane <i>(VO)</i> - Come here, you stupid... hold still, Daria... you're mine sting boy...
<p><i>(sound of paper slapping against something)</i>
<p>Daria <i>(VO)</i> - Ouch!
<p><i>(cut to Daria; she's rubbing a large, red sting welt that is forming on her forearm)</i>
<p>Daria - It stung me!
<p>Jane - He'll never do it again.
<p>Daria - Why didn't I just stay home, where it's nice and quiet and nothing ever happens?
<p><i>(outside the Morgendorffer house, silhouettes of Jake and Helen can be seen through the large corner window; Jake is chasing her around the living room)</i>
<p>Jake - Woooo!
<p>Helen - Stop!
<p>Jake - Oooh! Foxy lady!
<p><i>(both laugh and continue the chase)</i>
<p><i>(the Tank parks at Mom's Diner and all four get out)</i>
<p>Jane - I hate to tell you this, but there's a big, greasy spot of peanut buttery goodness on your butt.
<p>Daria - Of course there is.
<p><i>(all four are seated at a booth inside the diner, Jesse and Trent on one side, Daria and Jane on the other, while a waitress takes their order)</i>
<p>Waitress - Okay, that's a meatloaf, open turkey with fries, box of Frosted Flakes... those are pretty small, hon. Just one?
<p>Jesse - You're right. Make it five.
<p>Waitress - <i>(to Daria)</i> And you?
<p>Daria - Dry toast and tea, please.
<p>Waitress - I thought you looked depressed. You want a booster seat? <i>(short laugh before turning and yelling)</i> Five boxes of flakes and one nausea delight! <i>(normal voice)</i> You kids going to that rock 'n roll shindig out near Swedesville?
<p>Daria - No. We made a wrong turn on our way to Paris.
<p><i>(Jane, Trent and Jesse laugh)</i>
<p>Waitress - You've got a mouth on ya, don't ya?
<p>Daria - Why?
<p>Waitress - Ever thought of becoming a waitress?
<p><i>(on the road, Sandi is driving a yellow convertible, with Quinn, Stacy, Tiffany, Joey, Jeffy, and Jamie all crammed in with her)</i>
<p>Quinn - What's that smell?
<p>Stacy - Uck! A skunk!
<p><i>(top on the convertible rises and the car speeds up)</i>
<p><i>(at Mom's diner, Daria and Jane are in the women's bathroom)</i>
<p>Daria - Can you rig that glue gun of yours to shoot bullets? I'm ready to end my suffering.
<p>Jane - Well, you're not your usually sunny self.
<p>Daria - <i>(scowling)</i> I've got a bump on my head, a bug bite on my arm, a sandwich on my ass...
<p>Jane - And all in front of Trent.
<p>Daria - Now turn the knife counterclockwise. I can't go back out there. You go on to Alternapalooza; tomorrow, I'll emerge and begin my new life as a waitress.
<p>Jane - Daria, if there's one thing I know about my brother is that he's oblivious. There's no need to be self-conscious.
<p>Daria - <i>(sighs)</i> Okay.
<p>Jane - Now what are you gonna do about that stain on your butt?
<p><i>(Daria glares at Jane)</i>
<p>Jane - I'm kidding! It looks alternative.
<p><i>(on the road, the Tank is stuck in bumper to bumper traffic; slow montage of Daria, Jane, Jesse, and Trent's faces)</i>
<p>Trent - This is like that R.E.M. video, except you can't read anyone's mind.
<p><i>(the text "Thank God" is shown under Daria's face)</i>
<p><i>(cut to exterior view of stalled traffic and cars honking horns, then back to inside the Tank)</i>
<p>Daria - <i>(loudly)</i> I shouldn't have had that tea.
<p>Jane - <i>(loudly)</i> You have to go? There's some trees over there!
<p>Trent - <i>(loudly)</i> What the matter, Daria? You gotta whiz?
<p>Jesse - <i>(loudly)</i> What's wrong?
<p>Trent - <i>(loudly)</i> It's Daria. She has to pee.
<p>Jesse - <i>(loudly)</i> You have to pee, Daria? You can pee behind those trees. See those trees? You can pee behind there!
<p><i>(Daria gets out of van and walks toward trees)</i>
<p>Daria - If I'm not back in ten minutes, don't send help.

<p><hr>

<p><i>(view of shrubs and trees along side of road)</i>
<p>Daria <i>(VO)</i> - I knew I should've taken ballet. <i>(pause, then sound of squirrel)</i> Stop staring at me, you squirrel pervert!
<p><i>(Daria trips as she comes out from behind shrub)</i>
<p>Daria - Ow!
<p><i>(Daria enters van and closes door)</i>
<p>Trent - Cool, Daria?
<p>Daria - Yeah. I'm ready for my abuse, Mr. DeMille.
<p>Trent - Hey, I think the traffic's letting up.
<p><i>(traffic begins moving)</i>
<p>Daria - They're not going to make fun of me?
<p>Jane - For peeing in the woods? They're in a band, Daria. Those boys puke on each other on a regular basis.
<p>Jesse - <i>(to Trent)</i> That reminds me: you owe me a shirt.
<p><i>(at Mom's diner, the Fashion Club and Joey, Jeffy, and Jamie are standing at the entrance)</i>
<p>Tiffany - Ugh, stretch pants. Everywhere, stretch pants.
<p>Stacy - Hey, <i>these</i> are stretch pants! <i>I'm wearing stretch pants!</i>
<p><i>(Stacy panics and starts to hyperventilate; Sandi rushes over, grabs her arms, and shakes)</i>
<p>Sandi - They're leggings! They're leggings!
<p><i>(Stacy lets out a high-pitched squeak of relief)</i>
<p>Sandi - It's all right.
<p><i>(the same waitress as before walks over and looks at them)</i>
<p>Waitress - Three cheeseburger deluxe, four house salads. <i>(pause)</i> With oil and vinegar on the side!
<p><i>(elsewhere, Kevin, Brittany, Mack, and Jodie are already sitting at a booth)</i>
<p>Brittany - What do you mean, they don't have bathrooms at this thing? Is this your idea of a joke?
<p>Kevin - But, babe...
<p>Jodie - Brittany, how can you be so naive? It's strictly portable toilets.
<p>Brittany - No way! Gross! Next, you'll be telling me I have to sit on the ground!
<p><i>(Kevin, Jodie, and Mack look at each other)</i>
<p><i>(inside the Tank; the four are playing a game to pass the time)</i>
<p>Jane - Your turn, Trent. We're up to D.
<p>Trent - I'm going to the picnic, and I'm bringing asbestos insulation, brine shrimp, the cryogenically frozen head of Walt Disney... and a dromedary.
<p>Daria - I'm going to the picnic, and I'm bringing asbestos insulation, brine shrimp, the cryogenically frozen head of Walt Disney, a dromedary, and... a Eurocentric view of world history.
<p>Jane - I'm going to the picnic, and I'm bringing...
<p><i>(the van hits a bump and Daria's glasses fly off)</i>
<p>Daria - My glasses!
<p>Trent - Sorry! Hey, Janey, I saw that one coming.
<p><i>(Jesse holds up broken glasses)</i>
<p>Jesse - Don't worry. I can fix them.
<p>Jane - Need the glue gun? <i>(holds it aloft)</i>
<p>Daria - Keep that thing away from me. You'll miss and glue my eyelids shut.
<p>Jesse - There's some tape in the back there.
<p><i>(view of Daria's face with the bridge of her glasses held together with duct tape)</i>
<p>Daria - Duct tape. Great.
<p>Jane - It's fine. It looks alternative.
<p><i>(the Tank suddenly start sputtering, and Trent pulls it off the road before it finally dies, steam rising from engine)</i>
<p>Daria - <i>Now</i> my day's complete.
<p><i>(Sandi's car and Kevin's Jeep drive past the Tank)</i>
<p>Stacy - <i>(to Quinn)</i> Wasn't that your cousin back there?
<p>Quinn - <i>(distracted by her mirror)</i> What?
<p>Sandi - What's that smell?
<p>Stacy - Uck! Fertilizer!
<p><i>(top on the convertible rises and the car speeds up)</i>
<p><i>(Trent, Jesse, Jane, and Daria are gathered in front of the Tank's open hood; Jane holds an engine part)</i>
<p>Jesse - What do we do now?
<p>Jane - There's a noise wall up ahead. There must be houses behind it. Daria, you and Trent stay here; Jesse and I will find a phone and call for help. <i>(leans in)</i> Great plan, huh?
<p><i>(Daria's wide-open eyes shows how great she thinks it is)</i>
<p><i>(Sandi and Kevin's cars drive past a sign for the Wappington Mills Outlet Center)</i>
<p>Quinn - Outlet shopping!
<p>Sandi - Change of plan!
<p><i>(Joey, Jeffy, and Jamie start to protest as Stacy starts making triangle hand motions to Kevin's Jeep)</i>
<p>Mack - What is that? A pyramid?
<p>Jodie - A mountain?
<p>Kevin - A square?
<p><i>(Sandi's car exits highway next to sign for outlet center)</i>
<p>Brittany - A clothes hanger! Outlet shopping!
<p><i>(Brittany grabs steering wheel and drives Jeep onto exit)</i>
<p>Kevin - Heeeey!
<p><i>(roadside, Daria sits next to Trent, who is tuning an acoustic guitar)</i>
<p>Daria - What chord is that?
<p>Trent - G.
<p>Daria - Oh. <i>(pause)</i> Umm, nice tattoo. Tribal?
<p>Trent - Maori. I copied it out of <u>Tattoo World's</u> international issue.
<p>Daria - Very graphic, and meaningful.
<p>Trent - Yeah, it makes a statement. You know what it is?
<p>Daria <i>(VO)</i> - I got a tattoo out of a magazine?
<p>Trent - I got a tattoo out of a magazine.
<p><i>(both laugh)</i>
<p>Daria - I guess it's better than trying to copy one off the TV.
<p>Trent - Daria, do you ever feel like maybe you're wasting your life?
<p>Daria - Only when I'm awake.
<p>Trent - Like, no money, no job, you live with your parents, and you still can't play an open D tuning.
<p>Daria - Well, I haven't had those <i>exact</i> thoughts...
<p>Trent - Maybe I will end up a townie doing Doors covers. I mean, who's to say, right?
<p>Daria - Umm, you know, Trent, it takes a lot of guts to go after a dream, especially when you know that failure can mean spending the rest of your life playing "L.A. Woman"... in public.
<p>Trent - Hmm. I guess.
<p>Daria - And even if it doesn't work out, at least for now you're doing exactly what you want to.
<p>Trent - Yeah, that's true.
<p>Daria - A lot of people never even get that far.
<p>Trent - I guess I'm not doing too bad. You know, Daria, sometimes it's hard to believe you're in high school.
<p>Daria - I find the situation unbelievable myself.
<p>Trent - You're pretty cool.
<p>Daria - Thanks. <i>(she smiles)</i>
<p>Jane <i>(VO)</i> - Yo.
<p><i>(Jane and Jesse enter)</i>
<p>Trent - So?
<p>Jane - There was nothing behind that wall but a cornfield, and the corn wasn't very helpful.
<p>Jesse - Helpful Corn! That's a cool name for the band.
<p>Trent - Even better than Mystik Spiral, huh, Daria? <i>(he winks at Daria)</i>
<p><i>(Jane uses the glue gun on an engine line; cut to Trent in the driver's seat as he succeeds in starting the engine)</i>
<p>Trent - <i>(leans out window)</i> All right.
<p>Jane - <i>(holds up gun)</i> I knew this would come in handy.
<p>Daria - Stop pointing that thing at me!
<p>Jesse - Let's go. We can still catch some of the show.
<p><i>(heavy traffic on road going away from concert)</i>
<p>Jane - Uh, maybe not.
<p><i>(two guys approach with a third guy supported between them; the third guy is quite stoned)</i>
<p>Trent - Why's everybody going the wrong way?
<p>Guy #1 - The concert's over, man.
<p>Stoned Guy - It was amazing. Where am I?
<p>Jesse - Is he all right?
<p>Guy #2 - Oh, yeah, he's cool... just, you know, a little sleepy.
<p>Stoned Guy - <i>(looks at Daria)</i> Are you my Mommy?
<p><i>(Daria rolls her eyes)</i>
<p><i>(the Tank driving back at night; Daria, smiling, sits up front, while Jane and Jesse lean against each other, asleep, in back)</i>
<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(in the morning, Jake and Helen are in the kitchen; they're eyeing each other as Helen hums and makes pancakes -- in a very seductive manner -- on the countertop grill)</i>
<p>Helen - I should really make pancakes more often. The batter's so sensual.
<p>Jake - Like batter, like chef!
<p><i>(Daria and Quinn enter)</i>
<p>Helen - Hi, girls.
<p>Jake - How was the festival?
<p><i>(Daria and Quinn look at the other and quickly exit; Helen and Jake go back to eyeing each other)</i>
<p><i>(closing credits)</i>
