<p><i>(opening theme song)</i>
<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(Daria walks into the kitchen and sees Helen standing on a stepstool, rummaging around in the top shelf of an overhead cabinet)</i>
<p>Daria - Hiding the cooking sherry from Dad?
<p>Helen - I'm going to make some bread, Daria. <i>(pulls out a breadmaker and sets it on the counter)</i>
<p>Daria - Isn't that what supermarkets are for?
<p>Helen - The Yeagers are coming for the weekend, and I can't serve them store-bought bread.
<p>Daria - Why not?
<p>Helen - I haven't seen them for twenty five years, and let's just say they know a different Helen. A Helen famous for her oatmeal pumpkin seed loaf.
<p>Daria - And just what have you done with this Helen?
<p><i>(sound of car horn)</i>
<p>Helen - They're here! I hope they don't think I've changed too much. <i>(primps hair)</i>
<p>Daria - Just be yourself. That's what you've always told me.
<p>Helen - I could kick myself for that. <i>(walks outside)</i>
<p><i>(Daria and Quinn walk outside, to the sight of a classic Volkswagen Beetle parked at the curb)</i>
<p>Quinn - What kind of car is that?
<p>Daria - That's not a car. It's a time machine.
<p><i>(a couple in their late forties exits the car; they're dressed like refugees from the Sixties)</i>
<p>Helen - Willow! Coyote!
<p>Willow - Wow, Helen!
<p>Coyote - Man!
<p>Jake - My man!
<p>Helen - You haven't changed a bit.
<p>Willow - And you! Well, just look at you!
<p><i>(a German Shepherd comes up and sits next to Willow)</i>
<p>Helen - Why, even Leary is exactly the same.
<p>Jake - Come here, boy! Don't you remember old Jake?
<p>Helen - Wait, that can't be Leary. He'd be almost thirty by now!
<p>Willow - This is Leary number three.
<p>Coyote - We had to replace the original a couple times.
<p>Jake - If only you could do that with Timothy Leary, huh, man? <i>(laughs)</i>
<p>Coyote - They're working on it, man.
<p>Helen - Well, these two are irreplaceable. Our girls, Quinn and Daria.
<p>Willow - <i>(clasps Daria's hands)</i> You have a very old soul.
<p>Daria - It just looks mature for its age.
<p><i>(Willow returns to the company of Helen, Jake, and Coyote)</i>
<p>Quinn - Is this a retro thing, or are they serious?
<p>Jake - Let's get your bags, man!
<p>Coyote - We travel light.
<p>Daria - In the head. I gotta get out of here before I catch any more good vibes.
<p>Quinn - Daria, you can't leave me here with those, those... yuppies!
<p>Daria - Yuppies are from the Eighties.
<p>Quinn - So what do you call people in funny outfits who talk about peace and love and stuff?
<p>Daria - Trekkies. Anyway, one of us should stay. It's a rare opportunity to learn more about Mom and Dad.
<p>Quinn - Why would we want to do that?
<p>Daria - To use against them later. Twenty bucks if you dig up some dirt.
<p>Quinn - Sorry, I have a date. If you're getting out of this, so am I.
<p>Coyote - Ethan! Come meet the girls!
<p><i>(a good-looking teenager exits the car; unlike his parents, Ethan is dressed for the times, meaning a black T-shirt and jeans)</i>
<p>Quinn - You said twenty, right?
<p><i>(at the Lane house)</i>
<p><i>(Jane and Daria enter Trent's bedroom, where he and Jesse are sitting on the floor, switching back and forth between the same music playing on CD and vinyl LP)</i>
<p>Trent - Zappa digital... Zappa analog.
<p>Jesse - Sounds the same to me.
<p>Trent - And you call yourself a musician?
<p>Jesse - No, I call myself an interpreter of sound.
<p><i>(Trent puts headphones on)</i>
<p>Jane - Top secret experiment?
<p>Jesse - My parents gave me their old records to sell at the flea market, but now Trent wants to keep 'em.
<p>Trent - <i>(a bit loud)</i> It's the warmth of vinyl, man. I'm telling you, it's a richer tone.
<p>Jane - You're tuned to the radio. <i>(turns a knob)</i>
<p>Trent - I was wondering why Zappa was selling fish sticks.
<p>Jane - The flea market, huh? Need any help?
<p>Jesse - We have to be there by 7:00 to set up.
<p>Jane - No problem. Daria's an early bird.
<p>Daria - There's nothing like watching the sun rise, except watching the sun set in reverse.
<p><i>(Trent and Jesse laugh)</i>
<p>Trent - Good one, Daria.
<p>Daria - <i>(muttering)</i> Mmm, umm, thanks.
<p>Trent - Okay, this time, let's reverse the polarity of the plug. I'll stand facing west. <i>(stands)</i>
<p>Daria - Are you nuts?
<p>Jane - Hey, you could always go on home and swap yogurt recipes with the Yeagers.
<p>Daria - And what's wrong with <i>my</i> yogurt recipe?
<p>Jane - You should thank me. It's a chance for you to spend some quality time with Trent. The flea market is so romantic this time of year. I hear the Chia Pets are in bloom. <i>(to Trent and Jesse)</i> Okay, so, the flea market. We're there.
<p><i>(Jane and Daria leave the room)</i>
<p>Trent - Okay, now let's try the thing where I stand on the aluminum foil.
<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(the Yeagers and the Morgendorffers, minus Daria, are sitting at the kitchen table)</i>
<p>Coyote - So, for the past twelve years, we've been selling hammocks made out of hemp through the mail.
<p>Willow - And with all the new breakthroughs with hemp processing, this could be out most exciting year yet!
<p>Helen - Oh! That's fascinating. Quinn, didn't you have a date tonight?
<p>Quinn - I got Stacy to fill in.
<p>Jake - <i>(to Ethan)</i> You into sports, my man? <i>(no response)</i> Ethan?
<p>Ethan - Huh?
<p>Willow - We think there's enough aggressive behavior on the planet without creating more with quote unquote "healthy competition."
<p>Coyote - Ethan's gonna rock climb, when he's ready.
<p>Ethan - Whatever. Peas. <i>(spoons peas onto plate)</i>
<p>Willow - <i>(bites into slice of bread)</i> Hmmm. You can always tell when a bread isn't hand-kneaded. Hand-kneaded bread has more soul.
<p>Jake - This veggie stuff never fills me up. Anyone want a burger? <i>(gets several cross looks)</i> Hey, fair's fair. We'll all be worm food someday.
<p>Helen - Jake!
<p>Jake - It's the circle of life, Helen.
<p>Coyote - You know, man, you've become kind of aggressive.
<p>Jake - Have not!
<p>Willow - It's the meat.
<p>Jake - Is not!
<p>Willow - What ever happened to that mellow, let-it-be attitude you used to have?
<p>Helen - Jake?
<p><i>(flashback begins)</i>
<p><i>(Jake, Helen, Willow, Coyote, and others are standing in a circle outside the Pentagon)</i>
<p>Jake - Come on, everyone. If we focus all our positive energy, we can make the Pentagon rise off the ground.
<p><i>(nothing happens, which enrages Jake)</i>
<p>Jake - Rise, dammit! <i>(runs over and kicks building)</i> Ow!
<p><i>(flashback ends)</i>
<p>Jake - Stupid five-sided building.
<p>Willow - Remember our group house?
<p><i>(flashback begins)</i>
<p><i>(Helen and Willow are standing at the kitchen counter, preparing a meal)</i>
<p>Helen - Don't you see? So-called enlightened dudes are oppressing women, just like society is putting down the movement.
<p><i>(cut to the kitchen table, around which sits Jake, Coyote, and several others)</i>
<p>Helen <i>(VO)</i> - I want some help, and I want it now!
<p>Jake - Wow. Sounds like the girls are getting liberated.
<p>Coyote - Cool.
<p><i>(flashback ends)</i>
<p><i>(Helen is now standing at the kitchen counter, kneading a batch of bread dough)</i>
<p>Willow - And then, after you guys split, we painted a bus and drove out into the desert. I wish you would've stayed with us.
<p>Helen - Oh, Willow. It was time for us to move on.
<p>Coyote - If that's what you want to call it.
<p>Jake - What?
<p>Willow - Honey...
<p>Helen - What do you mean, Coyote? <i>(wipes forehead, leaving a smear of white flour)</i>
<p>Coyote - Nothing, I love you guys. It's just, I remember the way you were, that's all.
<p>Helen - We're still that way, deep down.
<p>Jake - Yeah, man! We're still that way! What way?
<p>Coyote - Free of the shallow, superficial value system of a profit-driven culture gone terribly, terribly wrong.
<p>Jake - Oh, sure, we're <i>that</i> way!
<p><i>(phone rings)</i>
<p><i>(Helen answers, and the scene alternates between Daria and Helen)</i>
<p>Daria - May I speak to the old lady of the house?
<p>Helen - Daria, where are you?
<p>Daria - Jane's. Can I stay over?
<p>Helen - I was hoping you would want to get to know our friends.
<p>Daria - My old soul has already made their acquaintance in a previous lifetime.
<p>Helen - Well, that does free up some space for Ethan. He can take the guest room, and I can put Willow and Coyote in your room.
<p>Daria - You're going to put them in my room? You better tether them to the bed so they don't float away.
<p><i>(Helen laughs, then slowly stops when she looks at Willow and Coyote)</i>
<p><i>(at the Lane house)</i>
<p><i>(the TV is showing a picture of a frog on a lily pad; the frog has a crown on its head)</i>
<p>SSW Announcer - A nightmare story of an enchanted kiss gone horribly wrong, when <i>Sick, Sad World</i> returns.
<p>Daria - Okay, I can stay. You have anything for me to sleep in?
<p><i>(Jane walks over to her closet; reaching into a pile of clothes on the floor, she pulls out a rumpled, old-fashioned nightgown that leaves absolutely everything to the imagination)</i>
<p>Jane - Don't thank me. Thank Grandma.

<p><hr>

<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(Quinn is escorting Ethan to Daria's room)</i>
<p>Quinn - And this, is where we keep Daria.
<p><i>(he looks around at the decor: padding and hand railing on the walls, sawed-off bars on the windows, skull and bones on the floor, etc.)</i>
<p>Ethan - Cool. Tell Mom and Dad I'm sleeping here. <i>(enters room and closes door)</i>
<p>Quinn - Ugh!
<p><i>(in Helen and Jake's private bathroom)</i>
<p>Jake - Once you could fit all your worldly possessions into a backpack. Pair of jeans, a few T-shirts, a copy of <u>Steal This Book</u>. And now, look at you. A capitalist cheerleader, a sellout in a monkey suit! Dammit! It's time to take a stand! You're not gonna shave tomorrow.
<p><i>(Helen enters the room)</i>
<p>Helen - Come on, Jakey, let someone else have a turn.
<p>Jake - Helen, do you think I'm past my prime?
<p>Helen - Of course not. You're still quite the young buck. Anyway, good looking men get even handsomer as they mature.
<p>Jake - Woo! Too bad it's not the same for women! <i>(chuckles, then stops at Helen's angry look)</i>
<p><i>(when Jake leaves the bathroom, Helen turns and looks at herself in the mirror, a concerned expression on her face)</i>
<p><i>(at the Lane house)</i>
<p><i>(Daria, dressed in the pink nightgown, is preparing to go to sleep; she slips off her glasses, and the view instantly turns blurry)</i>
<p>Daria - That's better. Now I can't see a thing.
<p><i>(there's a knock on the door; Daria flies across the room and leaps into her sleeping bag, covering everything except her face; the door opens to reveal Trent and Jesse)</i>
<p>Jesse - Big day tomorrow.
<p>Trent - We'll wake you at six. 'Night.
<p>Jane - Good night!
<p>Daria - <i>(mumbles)</i> 'Night, see you in the morning.
<p><i>(the door closes, and the room goes dark; in what seems to be no time at all, there's another knock and the door opens again)</i>
<p>Jane - <i>(sleepily)</i> Come back at six.
<p>Jesse - It is six.
<p>Jane - <i>(raises head)</i> Then how come you're so damn chipper?
<p>Trent - It was easier to stay up all night than to wake up early.
<p>Jesse - We'll load the van.
<p>Jane - Van?
<p>Jesse - You know, the Tank.
<p>Jane - Oh, goody. <i>(drops head back onto pillow)</i>
<p><i>(Trent and Jesse leave; Daria sits up in her sleeping bag)</i>
<p>Daria - Are they gone?
<p><i>(Trent appears at the door)</i>
<p>Trent - Don't forget some money. Hey, doesn't Grandma have a nightgown like that?
<p><i>(Trent leaves, and Daria puts her hand to her face in complete mortification)</i>
<p><i>(at the flea market)</i>
<p><i>(Daria and Jane are sorting through the LPs; Daria holds up the Velvet Underground's debut album, the one with Andy Warhol's banana painting on the cover)</i>
<p>Daria - Should I file this under "self-indulgent posers" or "underrated geniuses"?
<p>Jane - Ask Trent or Jesse, whichever one wakes up first. <i>(motions to the two guys, who are fast asleep)</i>
<p>Daria - I guess they call it a flea market because it makes you want to flea.
<p>Jane - Come on, relax. We're going to do well today. <i>(sarcastically)</i> We've got a choice location.
<p><i>(Jane indicates the booth next to theirs, where a man is selling "patriotic" toilet seat covers adorned with the faces of various presidents)</i>
<p><i>(Mrs. Johannsen approaches their booth)</i>
<p>Mrs. Johannsen - I'm looking for snow domes. You got any, girls?
<p>Daria - Sorry, ma'am. All we have are these strange, flat discs the aliens left behind. You know about the aliens, don't you?
<p><i>(Mrs. Johannsen leaves)</i>
<p>Jane - You enjoy working with the public, don't you.
<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(Willow and Coyote, dressed in their sleepwear, are meditating while balancing on their heads, their legs crossed)</i>
<p><i>(Helen is in the kitchen when Jake walks in; he's dressed in casual clothes, and is sporting a didn't-shave-today faceful of stubble)</i>
<p>Jake - Morning! Say hello to a new Jake. The old Jake! The Jake you haven't seen for a while. And goodbye to cookie-cutter corporate guy Jake. That Jake is gone, gone, gone.
<p>Helen - <i>(alarmed)</i> You didn't quit your job, did you?
<p>Jake - No, I'm growing a beard again.
<p>Helen - Oh! That's great, dear.
<p><i>(Quinn and Ethan enter the kitchen and sit at the table; Ethan looks like he could use another 96 hours of sleep)</i>
<p>Jake - Hey, Quinn! How do you like my, new look?
<p>Quinn - Dad, are you growing a goatee? That's so two years ago. Right, Ethan?
<p><i>(Willow and Coyote enter the kitchen and sit at the table)</i>
<p>Coyote - I really feel centered now.
<p>Willow - Nice whiskers.
<p>Jake - Thanks!
<p>Quinn - Um, it's kind of getting crowded in here. Why don't Ethan and I go out for breakfast. You guys can sit around and remember things.
<p>Ethan - It's breakfast? I thought it was lunch time. I'm going back to bed. <i>(gets up and leaves the kitchen)</i>
<p><i>(at the flea market)</i>
<p><i>(Jane is staring at Daria, who is staring at the sleeping Trent)</i>
<p>Jane - Why are you staring at my brother?
<p>Daria - Selfless concern. I think he stopped breathing.
<p>Jane - Nah, he's entering a dormant stage. In about ten years he should emerge as a butterfly. <i>(pause)</i> I guess you're gonna wait.
<p><i>(Trent opens his eyes just as Upchuck appears)</i>
<p>Upchuck - Hello, ladies! I didn't know you were of an entrepreneur bent. Perhaps you would be so kind as to show me your goods?
<p>Jane - Upchuck, what are you doing here?
<p>Upchuck - I am on a quest for the Holy Grail of fast food premiums. A complete 1985 California Raisins posable eraser set. Only mint condition will do. <i>(nods at Trent and Jesse)</i> Your investors?
<p>Jane - Silent partners.
<p><i>(a guy approaches the booth)</i>
<p>Guy - Um, do you by any chance have the cast recording of <i>Somebody Up There Likes Me</i>?
<p>Daria - No, but we do have <i>Somebody Down Here Doesn't</i>.
<p><i>(guy leaves)</i>
<p>Upchuck - I wonder if I may provide you gals with a lesson in salesmanship. It's a once in a lifetime offer.
<p>Daria - How about once in two lifetimes.
<p>Jane - Now, now, let the boy show us how to do it. Then we won't have to.
<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(Jake is sitting on one of the couches, juggling a set of balls, as Helen enters the room; Leary the dog is sitting nearby)</i>
<p>Jake - It's all coming back. You wanna try, honey?
<p>Helen - <i>(picks up drool-covered pillow)</i> Ugh, dog drool. That beast! <i>(to dog)</i> Outside!
<p><i>(phone rings as Willow and Coyote enter the room)</i>
<p>Helen <i>(into phone)</i> - Hello? Eric? What? They moved the hearing up to this week? I can be there in 20 minutes.
<p>Jake - Talk about uptight.
<p><i>(Helen finally catches on that Willow and Coyote are present, and abruptly chances her attitude)</i>
<p>Helen <i>(into phone)</i> - Mellow out, man. Nothing's so important that it can't wait till Monday, and what are you doing in the corporate cage on the weekend? Go take a walk in the park.
<p>Jake - Right on, honey.
<p>Willow - You still have your priorities.
<p>Coyote - Who's up for frisbee? Come on, Leary!
<p><i>(when Willow, Coyote, Jake, and Leary go outside, Helen's tone changes back to normal)</i>
<p>Helen <i>(into phone)</i> - Eric? Yes, of course I was kidding.
<p><i>(at the flea market)</i>
<p>Upchuck - You see, ladies, trying to close a sale without the proper technique is like playing cards without a full deck. You must treat your customers like a king. This is the ace up your sleeves. You're a joker if you don't, and you'll be left with jack.
<p>Daria - Wake me when you get to the twos.
<p><i>(at the toilet seat stall, Mr. DeMartino is talking with the man running the booth)</i>
<p>Man - FDR? No, sir, you won't find socialists on any of my toilet seats.
<p>Upchuck - Now, watch a pro in action. Hey! Mr. DeMartino!
<p>Mr. DeMartino - Well, Charles Ruttheimer. What is it, Charles?
<p>Upchuck - As a man of culture and breeding, I thought you might be interested in some of our audio gems.
<p>Mr. DeMartino - Is this a pathetic attempt at flattery, Mr. Ruttheimer? An obvious smoke screen for your calculated attempt to separate me from the payments I receive each week for babysitting a bunch of determined idiots?!?!
<p>Upchuck - <i>(frightened)</i> I just wanted to sell you some records...
<p>Mr. DeMartino - Got anything by Annette Funicello?

<p><hr>

<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(Jake is talking with Coyote, who is working on the Volkswagen)</i>
<p>Jake - Hey, man, after you get this baby fixed up, what do you say we go down to the club and play a round?
<p>Coyote - The golf course is an ecological disaster.
<p>Jake - What, you got trouble with your swing?
<p><i>(Helen and Willow arrive with a couple of bottles)</i>
<p>Helen - Here, we thought you boys might like some refreshments.
<p>Willow - Home-bottled berry juice. We're going to start a compost pile. Won't that be fun? <i>(Willow and Helen leave)</i>
<p>Jake - Wow! This is strong stuff!
<p>Willow - It's got natural pectins.
<p>Jake - I love pectins!
<p><i>(at the flea market)</i>
<p><i>(Upchuck is now behind the table, and is in the process of making a sale)</i>
<p>Guy - Is this the best you can do?
<p>Upchuck - 'Fraid so...
<p>Guy - Well then I'm just going to have to walk away. <i>(turns)</i> I'm walking... <i>(walks away, then returns a moment later)</i> Okay, fifty cents. <i>(hands money to Upchuck and takes LP)</i>
<p>Trent - Thanks, man. <i>(holds out hand, into which Upchuck drops the money)</i>
<p>Upchuck - What about my commission?
<p>Trent - Hey, we're training you for free.
<p>Jane - Well, Trent, now that you've returned to the land of the living, maybe you and Daria can go get us some soda. With caffeine?
<p>Trent - No problem. Coming?
<p>Daria - <i>(eyes wide)</i> Sure.
<p>Jane - Take your time!
<p><i>(Daria and Trent walk off)</i>
<p>Jesse - Hmm. I could use a burger.
<p>Jane - I'll go with you. Upchuck, can you handle the booth?
<p>Upchuck - I can handle much more than that, missy.
<p><i>(Jane and Jesse walk off; Upchuck then spots a man walking past the booth, reading a magazine)</i>
<p>Upchuck - Excuse me! Is that a vintage copy of <u>Eyefull</u>?
<p>Man - 1962.
<p>Upchuck - Where did you find such a treasure?
<p>Man - That booth over there.
<p><i>(Upchuck leaves the booth to find more copies of the magazine; when he does, the man takes several LPs, stuffs them into his jacket, and quickly walks away)</i>
<p><i>(elsewhere, Trent brings a tray of food to Daria at the foot court; Daria starts to fish in her pockets for money to pay for hers)</i>
<p>Trent - That's okay, I got it. <i>(sits down)</i>
<p>Daria - I owe you one, then.
<p>Trent - Next time. So, Janey says you're avoiding your parent's friends this weekend.
<p>Daria - Their sunny Sixties optimism tends to cancel out my bitter Nineties cynicism.
<p>Trent - Holdover hippies?
<p>Daria - Yeah. They're big believers in the concept of voluntary simplicity.
<p>Trent - I gotta use that. Sounds much better than broke.
<p>Daria - I guess you gotta give them some credit. Civil rights, environmentalism, the women's movement. People believed in stuff back then.
<p>Trent - I know. What's up with that?
<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(Jake and Coyote are now lounging on the hood of the Volkswagen)</i>
<p>Jake - I know what you're thinking, that I've turned into the man!
<p>Coyote - I'd never call you the man, man. Man, maybe, but not <i>the</i> man. <i>(suddenly throws his wrench)</i> I hate this stupid rusty piece of junk! And I'm tired of buying food in bulk! And not flushing every time I go because it wastes water!
<p>Jake - Ewww...!
<p><i>(behind the house, Helen and Willow are in the middle of creating a compost pile)</i>
<p>Helen - I'm still young. What happened to my beliefs? What happened to being part of the solution, not part of the problem?
<p>Willow - I hate kneading bread.
<p>Helen - What?
<p>Willow - <i>(stabbing ground with her rake)</i> I... hate... kneading... bread! <i>(slips and falls)</i> Damn!
<p>Helen - Oh Willow! Here!
<p><i>(she attempts to help Willow to her feet, only to get pulled down into the mud also)</i>
<p>Coyote - Man, can you teach me how to play golf?
<p>Jake - Sure I can, man.
<p>Coyote - And can we ride around on those little carts?
<p>Jake - Sure thing, pal! <i>(mud-covered Helen and Willow appear)</i> Hey, some kind of organic nutrient steam bath, right? Cool!
<p>Helen - Jake, we fell on our asses in a pile of garbage. I feel like a hog.
<p>Coyote - Hog! I miss bacon.
<p>Willow - Oh, thanks so much for your concern! <i>(both women leave)</i>
<p>Jake - Wow, sounds like the girls are getting liberated.
<p>Coyote - Cool.
<p><i>(Ethan and Quinn arrive; Ethan picks up Coyote's bottle and sniffs the contents)</i>
<p>Ethan - Dad, the berry juice fermented again. You gotta watch that. <i>(to Quinn)</i> Come on, I'll buy you a slush cup.
<p>Quinn - It's about time!
<p>Ethan - Got any money?
<p><i>(both kids leave as Jake catches a glimpse of his unshaven face in his berry juice bottle)</i>
<p>Jake - Where's my razor?
<p><i>(Jake runs into the house as Coyote looks at his bottle, shrugs, and takes a long drink from it)</i>
<p><i>(at the flea market)</i>
<p><i>(Jane and Jesse are walking back to the booth, sodas in hand)</i>
<p>Jane - You see, my theory is that our primitive hunting instinct has no outlet in modern society.
<p>Jesse - Cool. <i>(slurps soda)</i>
<p>Jane - So, rather than stalking animals, we substitute it with the shopping experience, and hunt for objects.
<p>Jesse - Cool. <i>(slurps soda)</i>
<p>Jane - <i>(exasperated)</i> And then, Jesse, while we're asleep, those objects come to life and plot their secret take over our civilization. April 1st, 2007. That's the day they make their move!
<p>Jesse - Cool. <i>(slurps soda)</i>
<p><i>(at the food court)</i>
<p>Daria - I don't know. All these people swapping useless junk. Maybe the Yeagers are onto something. At least they're not caught up in a constant state of consumer frenzy.
<p>Trent - Yeah, I guess if you're gonna insist on holding on to something from the Sixties, peace and love beats a <i>Get Smart</i> lunchbox.
<p>Daria - Especially if the lunch is still in it.
<p>Trent - Well, let's go give Jesse and Jane a break.
<p>Daria - Too late.
<p><i>(Jane and Jesse arrive)</i>
<p>Trent - Who's watching the booth?
<p>Jane - Upchuck.
<p>Daria - I don't think so.
<p><i>(points to Upchuck, who's rummaging through boxes of magazines with Mr. DeMartino)</i>
<p>Upchuck - Here, Mr. Demartino! I found another issue of <u>Bachelor Confidential</u>!
<p>Mr. DeMartino - You have redeemed yourself, Charles. Woof!
<p><i>(Jane grabs Upchuck by the ear and drags him over to their booth, which they find has been ransacked)</i>
<p>Upchuck - Um, less to carry home?
<p><i>(later, the foursome are heading home in the Tank; Jesse is riding shotgun next to Trent, while Jane and Daria sit in back)</i>
<p>Jesse - Well, we do have three copies left of "Boston."
<p>Trent - At least we're not money grabbing capitalist pigs, right, Daria?
<p>Daria - Yeah, we're hard core believers in voluntary simplicity.
<p><i>(at a fast food restaurant)</i>
<p><i>(Ethan and Quinn are sitting at a booth)</i>
<p>Ethan - No, they never formally charged them, but they did keep them there in jail for the next day.
<p>Quinn - Wow. Hey, where's my eyebrow pencil? This has gotta be worth at least twenty bucks. Now, tell me again about how Mom punched out the cop.
<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(Helen hands her electric bread maker to Willow)</i>
<p>Willow - You're sure you don't want this?
<p>Helen - I never use it.
<p>Willow - This will cut way down on the time I spending baking for Ethan and Coyote.
<p><i>(Helen walks over to the refrigerator, pulls a bag out of the freezer, and tosses it to Willow)</i>
<p>Helen - Sister, meet the frozen bagel. <i>(out the window)</i> Hey, guys, it's getting dark. When are you going to come in?
<p>Coyote <i>(VO)</i> - In a minute.
<p>Jake <i>(VO)</i> - I'm just showing Coyote how to drive without slicing! <i>(ball flies through window, narrowly missing Helen)</i> Better!
<p><i>(later, all of the adults are seated at the kitchen table when Daria, Quinn, and Ethan walk in)</i>
<p>Helen - Girls, I expected you for dinner. Before I officially ground you, would you care to account for your whereabouts?
<p>Daria - Sure. But first, a few questions. <i>(pulls out notepad)</i> Number one: why did you and Dad spend a night in jail in Boulder in August, 1969?
<p><i>(Helen gasps as Daria, Quinn, and Ethan wear smirks so sharp they could cut glass)</i>
<p><i>(the next morning, the Yeagers are packed up and ready to leave; the Morgendorffers are outside, saying their farewells)</i>
<p>Coyote - Thanks for that marketing plan, man. We're going to kick the butts of those wimps over at Rainbow Hammocks.
<p>Jake - Hey, take no prisoners, man. Predatory behavior is all natural.
<p>Quinn - Ethan?
<p>Ethan - Yeah?
<p>Quinn - You never told me whether you thought I was, you know, cute?
<p>Ethan - Oh, well, sure, you're cute.
<p>Quinn - Thanks.
<p>Ethan - You know, in a shallow, superficial way.
<p>Quinn - Thanks.
<p>Daria - It's very hard not to compliment you, isn't it?
<p>Quinn - Oh, Daria, you don't have to say that.
<p><i>(everyone shouts their good-byes to each other as the Yeagers drive away)</i>
<p>Quinn - Daria, do you think long-distance relationships are a good idea?
<p>Daria - Yeah. Why don't we try one?
<p>Jake - You know, kids, it's pointless to try to go back in time. You have to live in the present, and I'm going to start right now. First things first: I'm getting rid of all my vinyl records. Hey, Daria! You want 'em?
