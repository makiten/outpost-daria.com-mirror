<p><i>(opening theme song)</i>
<p><i>(at Lawndale High)</i>
<p><i>(Daria is at her locker when Jodie approaches)</i>
<p>Jodie - Hey, Daria. I didn't see you today. You said you might come to the photography meeting for yearbook.
<p>Daria - Yes, well, when the dentist turned off the gas, I had a change of heart.
<p>Jodie - But it's fun, and it looks good on your transcript.
<p>Daria - I'm against both those things.
<p>Jodie - Free film and developing.
<p>Daria - Mmm-hmm...
<p>Jodie - And if your parents find out that you're even considering it, you could probably squeeze some tremendous bribe out of them.
<p>Daria - I'll think about it.
<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(Daria, Jake, and Helen are seated at the kitchen table; Daria pushes a stack of money towards Helen)</i>
<p>Daria - I can't believe you're trying to bribe me... with singles.
<p>Helen - Sweetie, it's not a bribe, it's a deal. Honestly, you're worse than my clients.
<p>Daria - I'm sorry. Yearbooks completely distort the reality of high school. Of course, the yearbook experience <i>could</i> provide material for a web page... if I had the software.
<p>Jake - Software it is!
<p><i>(Jake grabs stack of cash as Quinn enters)</i>
<p>Quinn - Hi!
<p><i>(Quinn takes the money from Jake's hand)</i>
<p>Quinn - Big date! Can't talk! Bye! <i>(exits)</i>
<p><i>(at Lawndale High)</i>
<p><i>(in the yearbook room, Daria is examining a group of photo negatives when Ted enters)</i>
<p>Ted - Hey! You're Daria, right? I'm Ted, the photo editor. I saw your pictures.
<p>Daria - Then cut the small talk and get straight to firing me.
<p>Ted - <i>(laughs)</i> That's funny, because it's the exact opposite of the truth, right? You're using sarcasm, aren't you?
<p>Daria - Actually, I was being sincere for once. What planet are you from?
<p>Ted - Planet? <i>(laughs)</i> Hey! Hyperbole! Very interesting. No, seriously, though, I loved your photos. Your composition seems very Spanish, not unlike the peasant paintings of Francisco Goya. I'm a huge Goya fanatic. You?
<p>Daria - Um, yeah, huge.
<p><i>(at the Lane house)</i>
<p><i>(Daria and Jane are in Jane's room; Daria is lying on the bed reading and Jane is painting)</i>
<p>Jane - Actually, Goya liked to paint death, destruction, brutality. You'd have made good pen pals.
<p>Daria - And the interesting part is, he's never been to school. His parents have taught him at home until now. Isn't that kind of cool?
<p>Jane - I judge things by results, so I would have to say... no.
<p>Daria - Hey, sarcasm. You two would get along.
<p>Jane - If he makes you join his cult, can I have your web page software?
<p>Daria - He doesn't belong to a cult, and the shrink-wrap never comes off that software. Soon as I get it, I'm exchanging it for <i>Cannibal Fragfest</i> on CD-ROM.
<p>Jane - Computer ultra-violence. Goya would have loved that.
<p><i>(at Lawndale High)</i>
<p><i>(Ted and Daria are sitting in the yearbook room)</i>
<p>Daria - Well, since you ask, I was kind of trying to get a high contrast of light and dark.
<p>Ted - Neat! You must read a lot of Ovid. I read <u>Orpheus in the Underworld</u> when I was six, and it still haunts me.
<p>Daria - Uh, yeah. Me, too.
<p>Ted - You know, I had to talk my parents into going to a normal school.
<p>Daria - When do you start?
<p>Ted - <i>(laugh)</i> Irony! But I like it here. I only wish that volunteering or charity fundraising got as much yearbook space as sports and clubs. Come on!
<p><i>(Ted and Daria go to Mr. DeMartino's desk)</i>
<p>Ted - Mr. DeMartino? Daria and I were just saying that there are some students at school who are really making a difference, and maybe we're short-changing them a little bit in the yearbook.
<p>Mr. DeMartino - How noble. Perhaps you think we should cut some pages from sports and clubs to make more room?
<p>Ted - Hey! Good idea, sir!
<p>Mr. DeMartino - Let me pause and reflect. Everyone! Sports and clubs are cut by ten pages!
<p><i>(everyone starts shouting their objections)</i>
<p>Mr. DeMartino - Ha! Not my idea! You've been sabotaged by your own kind. <i>They</i> thought of it.
<p><i>(Daria looks as if she wants to crawl into her locker, while Ted is blissfully unaware of the hostility aimed their way)</i>
<p>Ted - This is going to be great!
<p><i>(in the hallway, Daria is at her locker when Kevin and Brittany approach)</i>
<p>Daria - Hello?
<p>Kevin - Hello, traitor. It's a nice day, isn't it... for a traitor.
<p>Daria - How can I betray something I don't believe in?
<p>Kevin - In case you didn't know, sports are, like, the beating heart of the yearbook... um, system!
<p>Brittany - Yeah! Plus, it's like getting in the yearbook is the only reason to join French Club in the first place!
<p>Daria - Gee, Brittany, what about your deep love for French people and their culture?
<p>Brittany - Love had nothing to do with it! He was just a lonely exchange student, and I wanted to give him an American goodbye!
<p>Daria - Huh?
<p>Kevin - Huh?
<p>Brittany - Sorry... this yearbook crisis is just messing me up!
<p>Kevin - It's all right babe. See what you've done? Traitor!
<p><i>(Kevin and Brittany exit)</i>
<p><i>(in the cafeteria, the Fashion Club members are seated at a table)</i>
<p>Stacy - It's totally rude!
<p>Tiffany - Completely heinous.
<p>Sandi - It's like this girl Daria doesn't understand reason, or something.
<p>Quinn - Well, I hear she's a brain. You can't reason with brains.
<p>Sandi - I'm still going to talk to her. As president of the Fashion Club, I can be kind of intimidating.
<p>Quinn - Oh, you're definitely scary, Sandi. But I think this is a special case, so let me talk to her. It would mean so much if you let me try.
<p>Sandi - You're the best.
<p>Quinn - No, you.
<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(Daria is sitting on her bed, reading, while Quinn stands nearby, trying to present her case)</i>
<p>Quinn - But you can't be serious about this.
<p>Daria - Listen, Ted has a point.
<p>Quinn - Ah-ha! It's that boy. So, it's all about love, is it?
<p>Daria - It is <i>not</i> about love.
<p>Quinn - All right, keep it your secret to cherish always. But just because you're going out...
<p>Daria - Ted and I are <i>not</i> going out.
<p>Quinn - Whatever. Just tell "loverboy" we want our yearbook back.
<p>Daria - Did you hear that? You just used the verb "want" with the noun "book."
<p>Quinn - Save the math games for your boyfriend. <i>(leaves)</i>
<p><i>(at the Dewitt-Clinton house)</i>
<p><i>(a knock is heard, and Ted opens the front door for Daria)</i>
<p>Ted - Gosh, I'm glad you could come over. Did you have any trouble finding it?
<p>Daria - The corn growing in your front yard sort of tipped me off.
<p>Ted - Yeah. We keep the squash and beans in the back. I've got all these photo ideas that I want to tell you about. I think a WPA black-and-white dust bowl documentary style would be perfect!
<p>Daria - Um, yeah. Hey, what's this? <i>(points to wooden box on a shelf)</i>
<p>Ted - Oh, that's the phonograph my dad and I made, and from what I've heard about television, this is just a good! Hey, I have some early music played on period instruments. You feel like you're right there in front of the viola da gamba!
<p>Daria - Actually, Ted, maybe just quiet.
<p><i>(they sit on a wooden sofa)</i>
<p>Daria - This couch is all wood. You and your dad made it, didn't you?
<p>Ted - Georgia pine! Very soft.
<p>Daria - Okay, that does it. <i>(stands)</i> I'm sorry Ted; I can't keep up with you.
<p>Ted - Keep up? What are you talking about? <i>You're</i> the remarkable one.
<p>Daria - Oh. <i>(sits down again)</i>
<p>Ted - I mean, please don't take this wrong, but you've got it all.
<p>Daria - Um, thanks. Here, want some gum?
<p>Ted - Hmm. <i>(takes a stick and starts chewing)</i>
<p>Daria - I guess when all is said and done, we're just a couple of ordinary American teenagers. Right? <i>(pause)</i> Ted?
<p>Ted - Wow! So this is gum! I like it! Mom! Dad! Gum! I got gum!
<p><i>(Ted runs off as Daria buries her face in her hands)</i>

<p><hr>

<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(at the sound of banging on the front door, Jake opens it to reveal two rather pissed-off people: Leslie DeWitt and Grant Clinton, Ted's parents)</i>
<p>Grant - Morgendorffers?
<p>Jake - If this is for Greenpeace, uh, we've already given.
<p>Leslie - Greenpeace? Those corporate puppets?
<p>Helen - Do we know you?
<p>Leslie - Leslie Dewitt.
<p>Grant - Grant Clinton. Ted Dewitt-Clinton's parents.
<p>Helen - Sorry, is he one of the boys who went out with Quinn the other night?
<p>Grant - Does this look familiar?
<p><i>(holds out a small plastic bag with a wad of used gum)</i>
<p>Jake - Gum?
<p>Leslie - Yes, from your daughter Daria.
<p>Helen - Would you like to come in for a drink?
<p>Grant - Alcohol, I presume. Well, now I see where she gets it.
<p>Helen - I'll make a pot of coffee.
<p>Grant - Caffeine?!
<p>Jake - I don't really understand the problem here.
<p>Leslie - Naturally. You people are happy chewing on the empty offerings of so-called modern society. We'd just appreciate it if you kept them away from our son's mouth.
<p>Helen - Now, look here, hippy. Daria may be a handful sometimes, but just because she gave your kid some gum is no reason...
<p>Leslie - It wasn't just the gum. She also gave him this.
<p><i>(hands Jake a cassette tape)</i>
<p>Jake - The Beatles?
<p><i>(Grant starts to cry)</i>
<p>Leslie - We've tried so hard, and nobody seems to care.
<p><i>(Grant and Leslie leave)</i>
<p>Jake - Who the hell is this Ted kid?
<p>Helen - And what's happening to this neighborhood? First people growing corn, now this?
<p><i>(at Lawndale high)</i>
<p><i>(Daria and Jane are seated at a table in the cafeteria)</i>
<p>Daria - Well, maybe he is a little weird, but he's also a little sweet. Isn't that important?
<p>Jane - Not as important as the fact that he never had gum before. This is so cute! You're involved with a kook!
<p>Daria - We're <i>not</i> involved.
<p><i>(Ted enters)</i>
<p>Ted - Hi, Daria! I was looking for you. I carved you this necklace, as thanks for the gum.
<p>Jane - That's beautiful. I guess <i>somebody</i> here is involved.
<p>Ted - Involved in what? Hey, who wants some hummus?
<p>Daria - I can't take this. Keep it.
<p>Ted - But I want you to have it. I made it...
<p>Daria - Ted, I can't take it. We work together on yearbook. We don't make jewelry for each other.
<p>Ted - You aren't being sarcastic or hyperbolic, are you?
<p>Daria - No.
<p>Ted - Oh, then I guess I'll see you at yearbook.
<p><i>(Ted exits)</i>
<p>Jane - Um, you did the right thing?
<p>Daria - Yeah. A guy makes me a necklace by hand and I act like it's nuclear waste. Sure. I did the right thing.
<p>Jane - Okay, <i>now</i> you're being sarcastic.
<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(Helen, Jake, and Quinn are in the kitchen)</i>
<p>Helen - But why haven't we heard about this boy before?
<p>Quinn - Because he's a freak!
<p>Jake - Freak is, uh, good, right?
<p>Quinn - Yeah, if you think belonging to a cult is good. Plus, everybody in the cult has to wear ugly clothes and be completely unsocial. It's the worst!
<p><i>(Daria enters)</i>
<p>Helen - A cult? Who is Ted and why haven't you told us about him, and is he trying to get you to join a cult?
<p>Daria - <i>(rolls eyes)</i> Oh, brother.
<p>Jake - He calls himself brother? You mean like Brother Ted?
<p>Daria - No, like, "Oh, brother, you're all crazy." Ted is a nice guy from yearbook. He's odd, but he's not in a cult. And for the last time, we are <i>not</i> going out. <i>(exits)</i>
<p>Helen - She's obviously lying.
<p>Jake - Absolutely.
<p>Quinn - No question.
<p>Helen - Can't you talk to her, Quinn? Why don't you set her up with one of your friends? They're all normal.
<p>Quinn - Yeah, and that's exactly why they would laugh me out of town if I tried.
<p>Jake - If you do, Mom and I will make it sweet for you.
<p>Quinn - How sweet?
<p>Helen - How does your own web page sound?
<p>Quinn - Not as nice as the crunch-crunch-crunch sound of a new pair of shoes on the high school parking lot.
<p>Jake - Deal! Quinn, you're the best.
<p>Quinn - Duh.
<p><i>(at Lawndale High)</i>
<p><i>(the Fashion Club members are seated at a table in the cafeteria; several boys are seated at the far end of the table)</i>
<p>Tiffany - I don't understand why we should help some random loser find a date.
<p>Sandi - Now, that's exactly the kind of negative attitude that says, "I'm a fashion news reader and not a fashion news maker."
<p>Quinn - Thank you, Sandi.
<p>Stacy - But who will we get to be her date?
<p>Quinn - <i>(glances at end of table)</i> Robert? You like sitting at the other end of our table, right?
<p>Robert - Uh, yes, ma'am!
<p>Quinn - Then I have an assignment for you.
<p>Robert - Yes, ma'am!
<p><i>(in the gymnasium)</i>
<p><i>(Daria and Jane are next to a trampoline that the student nicknamed "Burnout Girl" is jumping on)</i>
<p>Daria - Do you think I was too mean to Ted?
<p>Jane - Oh, brother.
<p>Daria - He's not a brother, and he's not in a cult. He's just very honest and ethical and smart, and I shouldn't have been so mean.
<p>Jane - Whoa. You're really into him, aren't you?
<p>Daria - No, but I do like the way he scares my parents.
<p>Jane - Are you sure annoying your parents is good grounds for a relationship?
<p>Daria - It was for Romeo and Juliet.
<p><i>(suddenly, Burnout Girl screams and bounces off the trampoline, falling to the floor behind Daria and Jane)</i>
<p><i>(in the yearbook room)</i>
<p>Daria - Um, Ted, I think I owe you an apology. Your necklace was beautiful and I was a jerk for not taking it.
<p>Ted - That's okay.
<p>Daria - Really? Good. Then I was hoping you'd let me buy you a slice of pizza.
<p>Ted - To be honest, Daria, I think maybe you were right. We should keep our friendship on a strictly yearbook level.
<p>Daria - Wait a minute. Are you blowing me off?
<p>Ted - Well, my parents warned me that kids in conventional school can be kind of... shallow.
<p>Daria - You think I'm shallow?
<p>Ted - You sort of remind me of that really popular girl I've seen around... Quinn, I think. Do you know her? You'd probably get along.
<p><i>(judging by the look on her face, Daria's shock could probably be felt on the other side of the planet)</i>
<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(Daria and Quinn are watching TV in the living room; the screen shows the <i>Sick, Sad World</i> logo, followed by the image of a penny)</i>
<p>SSW Announcer - Next on <i>Sick, Sad World</i>: hoax, or vision? Some people in Florida claim they've seen the face of Jesus... on a penny!
<p>Quinn - Look, if you get thrown off a horse, you have to get back up and shoot it, right?
<p>Daria - I guess so.
<p>Quinn - So, I know this cute guy who's got a huge crush on you. Let's double!
<p>Daria - All right, this is either a plot to humiliate me, or you need me to go so I can do something for you.
<p>Quinn - Okay, okay, it's a trick. If you come, Mom and Dad will extend my curfew by half an hour, plus I'm dating this guy Shawn who never shuts up. I want someone else there who can talk.
<p>Daria - Forget it.
<p>Quinn - Ten bucks?
<p>Daria - Per hour.
<p>Quinn - You're on.
<p>Daria - Nope, I've changed my mind.
<p>Quinn - Come on, Daria! You want Mom and Dad to set you up with somebody?
<p>Daria - <i>(rolls eyes)</i> Oh, God.
<p>Quinn - Now, hurry up and get ready. I want to get to the shoe store before it closes.
<p><i>(blue SUV drives down the street; inside are Quinn and Shawn in front, Daria and Robert in back)</i>
<p>Daria - So, what exactly are we going to do on our date?
<p>Shawn - What?
<p>Quinn - Quiet, Shawn. <i>(to Daria)</i> We'll drive around; go to a convenience store... whatever. The usual random teenage shenanigans. Isn't that great? <i>(Quinn hits Robert)</i> Talk to her!
<p><i>(Robert starts to read from a stack of note cards)</i>
<p>Robert - Um, so, what do you think of UN-mandated emission control laws for Third World countries?
<p>Daria - Noble idea, but the UN's time table is unrealistic. How about you?
<p>Robert - Uh, same. Agree or disagree: trade embargoes are an effective way to deal with countries that vi-o-late human rights.
<p>Daria - Agreed, but with major trading partners like China, our government always finds a loophole. You?
<p>Robert - Yeah, same. Can sports and clubs get their pages back in the yearbook?
<p>Daria - Okay, stop the car.
<p>Shawn - What?
<p>Quinn - Quiet, Shawn. <i>(to Daria)</i> Why? You two are getting along great!
<p>Daria - I should've known this wasn't a real date when Robert here kept calling me "Darcy."
<p>Robert - Sorry, ma'am.
<p>Daria - And "ma'am." You were trying to buy my influence with a date?
<p>Quinn - That's how we do it in America, comrade.
<p><i>(Daria gets out of car and walks away)</i>
<p>Quinn - Nice work.
<p>Shawn - What?
<p>Quinn - Quiet, Shawn. I meant bonehead, here.
<p>Robert - The cards got mixed up.
<p>Quinn - From now on, you'll have to find a different table to sit at during lunch.
<p><i>(Robert starts to cry)</i>
<p>Quinn - <i>(relents slightly)</i> For the next week.
<p>Robert - Thank you. Thank you.
<p>Shawn - What?

<p><hr>

<p><i>(at Lawndale High)</i>
<p><i>(Ted and Daria are examining photographs in the yearbook room)</i>
<p>Ted - This one's great. You can really feel the pain. But aren't there supposed to be spotters at the trampoline?
<p>Daria - Well, I don't think even spotters could've stopped that fall. Anyway, she's fine. In fact, she fell off the uneven bars today, so it was clearly her own fault.
<p><i>(the Fashion Club, plus Kevin and Brittany, enter and face Mr. DeMartino)</i>
<p>Daria - Uh-oh. The angry villagers.
<p>Sandi - We want our rightful yearbook pages.
<p>Brittany - It's not fair that a couple of outsiders are dictating the way yearbook is done.
<p><i>(Note: Brittany squeaks the word "outsiders," which Mr. DeMartino then sarcastically imitates)</i>
<p>Mr. DeMartino - Hey, these two outsiders made a good suggestion, and if it's a good suggestion, who cares if it's fair?
<p>Quinn - Stand your ground. They can't make us go.
<p>Ted - Hey, everybody! Why don't we postpone the showdown until after the sale at Cashman's?
<p><i>(the Fashion Club runs out)</i>
<p>Kevin - Not so fast. I'm not leaving until I get results.
<p>Ted - Shall we settle it with a grip contest?
<p><i>(Ted grabs Kevin's hand)</i>
<p>Kevin - What's that?
<p><i>(Ted twists Kevin's arm around)</i>
<p>Kevin - Ow! The geek's hurting me! Ow! Ooh! Ow!
<p><i>(Ted releases Kevin)</i>
<p>Brittany - Babe! Are you all right?
<p>Mr. DeMartino - That's it. I'm talking to the union. Next year, chess club.
<p>Daria - That was a good trick.
<p>Ted - Isometric exercises. I've been doing them since age ten.
<p>Daria - Ted, I've been thinking. Can we bend our yearbook-only policy and maybe go out for some pizza?
<p>Ted - Pizza sounds great!
<p>Daria - Really?
<p>Ted - Pizza... what's it mean?
<p><i>(at the pizza place)</i>
<p><i>(Ted and Daria at sitting in a booth, a pizza on the table between them)</i>
<p>Ted - I hate to say it, but I think I enjoy this processed cheese. What kind of process do they use?
<p>Daria - It's a sugarless version of the one for Ding-Dongs and Ho-Hos.
<p>Ted - <i>(laughs)</i> Ding-Dongs and Ho-Hos! You're crazy! I think that's kind of why I like you.
<p>Daria - I like you, too. That's what's really crazy.
<p><i>(both take a bite of pizza and pull the slice away, trailing a string of cheese; Daria blushes and they start talking over each other)</i>
<p><i>(at Lawndale High)</i>
<p><i>(Mr. DeMartino is in the yearbook room when Ms. Barch enters)</i>
<p>Mr. DeMartino - Ah, Ms. Barch.
<p>Ms. Barch - I understand you're cutting the club pictures out of the yearbook.
<p>Mr. DeMartino - We decided to shift the emphasis...
<p>Ms. Barch - Oh, save it. You know who the faculty advisor to the Science Club is?
<p>Mr. DeMartino - Uh...
<p>Ms. Barch - The same person who sponsors the Take Back the Night Lawndale High School women's self-defense club.
<p><i>(Mr. DeMartino goes wide-eyed just before Ms. Barch starts kicking his ass around the room)</i>
<p><i>(at the pizza place)</i>
<p>Ted - So, what do degenerate outsiders like us do after pizza?
<p>Daria - I thought maybe we could play some video games at the arcade.
<p>Ted - Oh, no, I don't think so. Gum is one thing, but...
<p>Daria - They're harmless. Besides, if you're drafted, you need to know about them.
<p>Ted - I guess I am a little curious.
<p><i>(at Mr. Fun's Exciting World of Games)</i>
<p><i>(Daria and Ted enter and walk past Robert and two friends seated at a counter)</i>
<p>Robert - Come on, dudes, let's get over there.
<p>Guy - Why?
<p>Robert - So we can hassle that chick Darcy and her date.
<p>Guy - Why?
<p>Robert - I can't remember, but I think it's important.
<p><i>(Daria and Ted walk up to a virtual 3D simulator)</i>
<p>Attendant - Which do you want? Castle scenario, underwater paradise, futuristic dystopia?
<p>Ted - I guess the castle one.
<p>Attendant - Okey-doke, boss.
<p><i>(Daria and Ted each step onto the pads and slip a pair of VR goggles on; the view shifts to the inside of the game, a </i>TRON<i>-like environment where both Ted and Daria are dressed in suits of armor)</i>
<p>Ted - Daria?
<p>Daria - It's too much, right? I feel a little sick myself.
<p><i>(Ted looks around in awe)</i>
<p>Ted - It's not really representative of medieval society, but I have to say this is the coolest thing I've ever seen in my life!
<p><i>(outside, Robert and friends approach the attendant)</i>
<p>Robert - Uh, those are some friends of ours. Can we join in?
<p><i>(inside the VR game)</i>
<p>Ted - The royal throne!
<p>Daria - Good. I need to sit down.
<p><i>(Robert and his two friends appear in the game)</i>
<p>Robert - Not so fast, weirdoes.
<p>Daria - Robert?
<p>Robert - That's Sir Robert, Darcy.
<p>Daria - Daria.
<p><i>(Robert and friends charge and Ted steps in, easily beating all three back with his sword)</i>
<p>Daria - Ted? Wow.
<p>Ted - I taught myself from the eleventh-century manuscript on swordplay. It's easy.
<p>Robert - No way. I'm not going out like this. Come on!
<p><i>(Robert runs away after his friends)</i>
<p>Ted - Let's go, Daria. We can catch them!
<p>Daria - This is making me nauseous. You go ahead.
<p><i>(Ted chases Robert as Daria removes the helmet)</i>
<p>Daria - Ah.
<p><i>(Daria sits down on a bench; after some time passes, she walks up to where Ted and the others are still playing)</i>
<p>Daria - Ted, they're gonna close up pretty soon.
<p>Ted - They'll have to pull the plug, then. We still have a lot of fight left. Right, men?
<p>Guys - Aye!
<p><i>(Daria exits, leaving Ted and the other guys to continue playing)</i>
<p><i>(at Lawndale High)</i>
<p><i>(Daria and Jane are standing in the hallway)</i>
<p>Daria - It's my own fault. He didn't even want to go to the arcade.
<p>Jane - I told you: first date, stick to vandalism and loitering, but you always have to be different. <i>(looks down the hall)</i> Heads up.
<p><i>(Ted walks in from the other direction with Robert and his friends)</i>
<p>Ted - What you want to do is take the strain off your wrist and use more on your elbow. Like this! <i>(lunges with an imaginary sword)</i>
<p>Robert - Oh, yeah! You gotta show me on the machine. Maybe after school?
<p>Ted - Okay. You don't know where we might obtain some gum, do you?
<p>Jane - Boys playing with swords. I think that probably has some significance.
<p>Daria - Oh, well. At least we're still fighting the good fight at yearbook. I'll see you later.
<p><i>(in the yearbook room)</i>
<p><i>(when Daria walks in the door, she notices that Mr. DeMartino has a black eye)</i>
<p>Mr. DeMartino - Ah, Daria. I have some bad news about those pages we took from sports and clubs. <i>(hand goes to eye)</i> Ow, woman!
<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(Helen and Jake are seated in the living room as Daria enters)</i>
<p>Daria - I have to tell you something.
<p>Jake - You joined the cult?
<p>Daria - There's no cult. I had to resign from yearbook. It was a question of ethics.
<p>Helen - <i>(weary)</i> Again?
<p>Jake - Don't worry, she was on staff for a week. She can still put it on her college application!
<p>Daria - No questions about ethics here. So, then, can I keep the web page stuff?
<p>Helen - Actually, we gave it to Quinn.
<p>Daria - Quinn? Did she remove the shrink-wrap?
<p><i>(Quinn, in her room, is looking at her personal web page on a laptop computer)</i>
<p>Daria - I don't believe it. You did this yourself?
<p>Quinn - Of course not. I had one of the cuter technical types from school set it up for me.
<p>Daria - I had to ask.
<p>Quinn - Oh, sorry it didn't work out with that Ted guy. Isn't it funny that now it turns out that he's almost sort of cool and interesting?
<p>Daria - Yeah, hilarious.
<p>Quinn - Hey! Check it out! My web page just had twenty-five hundred hits in just the last three hours!
<p>Daria - Really? I can beat that.
<p>Quinn - You don't even have a web page.
<p>Daria - No... but I can hit.
<p><i>(Daria closes the door; we then hear the unmistakable sounds of Quinn being slapped silly)</i>
<p>Quinn - Ow! Ow! Mom! Dad! Help!
<p><i>(closing credits)</i>
