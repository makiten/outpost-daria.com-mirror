<p>(opening theme song)
<p>(in Ms. Defoe's class)
<p>Brittany - Jane, your picture's full of bloody people! That's not a still life!
<p>Jane - Sure it is. The blood's the reason they're so still.
<p>Kevin - Blood? Cool! Hey, Jane, paint something with blood on my canvas. And maggots!
<p>Jane - Sorry, sport boy. These itty-bitty canvases just don't do it for me. How I long for a medium grand enough to do justice to my inner torment!
<p>Ms. Li - (enters) Good morning, students. Where is your instructor?
<p>Brittany - She went to the ladies' room.
<p>Ms. Li - (into tape recorder) 10:25, Defoe leaves post without clearance for personal business. Initiate investigation. (to class) Anyway, I just dropped in to caution you that the school dance is in two weeks, and security is going to be especially tight. So, if anyone is thinking of rigging a bucket of pig's blood to the rafters, well, they can just forget it. (leaves)
<p>Daria - There goes my weekend.
<p>(in the hallway)
<p>Kevin - The dance is going to be cool.
<p>Brittany - (smacks Kevin) You callous oaf!
<p>Kevin - Ow! What?
<p>Brittany - Did you forget the last dance, when I caught you <i>making out</i> with Zoe?!
<p>Kevin - For the 50th time, babe, I was fixing her nose ring!
<p>Brittany - What do you think, I'm stupid and stuff?
<p>Kevin - Hey, I've already told you, smart doesn't matter with a body like mine... I mean yours.
<p>Brittany - Hmph! For your information, there are plenty of guys who think I'm pretty <i>and</i> smart!
<p>Daria - You can visit them at the Cedars of Lawndale head injury ward.
<p>Brittany - Ooh, I'm sick of this! Maybe it's time I find someone who really appreciates me!
<p>Kevin - Maybe I should find someone who really appreciates me!
<p>Jane - Hello, Mom?
<p>Brittany - Then you just go ahead and do that because it's, it's over! And this time I mean it! (leaves)
<p>Kevin - Oh, yeah? It's double over for me! (leaves)
<p>Jane - You don't really think...
<p>Daria - Forget it. That species mates for life.
<p>(in Mr. O'Neill's class)
<p>(bell rings)
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Now remember, your Hemingway essays are due in one week. And this time, Stacy, it's Ernest, not Mariel.
<p>Stacy - Sorry.
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Oh, um, class, before you go, we're still looking for someone to head the dance committee. Remember, to volunteer is to say "I care."
<p>Sandi - Dance committee... (shivers)
<p>(flashback)
<p>Young Sandi - I'll never work on another dance again! They expect you to do stuff, and now everything's messed up and the whole school's going to blame me. Plus, I haven't even had time to find sandals to go with my new halter dress!
<p>Young Linda - Sandi, I warned you. To volunteer is to say, "use me."
<p>(present)
<p>Tiffany - Sandi, are you okay?
<p>Sandi - Gee, Quinn, I think you should volunteer. You have such good taste.
<p>Quinn - Um, but you have even better taste, Sandi. You should volunteer.
<p>Sandi - I know, why don't you take the job and appoint the Fashion Club as your committee? Of course, if you don't think we're up to it then just say so.
<p>Quinn - Um, okay, I guess. Mr. O'Neill, I'll head the dance committee.
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Really? Great! Get ready to work like you've never worked before!
<p>Quinn - Oh, I'll have the Fashion Club to help me. Right, guys? Guys?
<p>(in the hallway)
<p>Brittany - I've had it! Kevin and I are finally over for good!
<p>Angie - Is it over-over, like the time he got you a football for your birthday, or just over, like the time he thought your goldfish needed air?
<p>Brittany - No, this time it's really over-over. And as fellow cheerleaders, you have to swear on a stack of pompoms not to go to the dance with that two-timing, scum of the earth, Kevin.
<p>All - We solemnly swear not to go to the dance with that two-timing, scum of the earth, Kevin. Yay, team!
<p>(in the hallway)
<p>Kevin - So it's agreed. No one asks Brittany to the dance. We're men; we got to stick together. We show them who's boss.
<p>(everyone agrees)
<p>Quinn - (walks past) Hi.
<p>(Three J's run after Quinn)
<p>Kevin - Yo, guys! Guys!
<p>(at Daria's house)
<p>Quinn - So I said maybe we should get a velvet rope and hire a bouncer to keep out, you know, the undesirable elements.
<p>Jake - I remember those dances. You want to talk about humiliation? The one time I had a date she stood me up for Mr. Campus Hot Stuff. Oh, but I showed her! I went anyway! How I wanted to wring her little...!
<p>Helen - Daria, are you going to the dance?
<p>Quinn - Of course she's not going. Only a <i>loser</i> would go to a dance without a date.
<p>Jake - School dances suck! (stabs mashed potatoes)
<p>Helen - Jake! Here, make a guest house. (spoons potatoes onto plate)
<p>Jake - All right!
<p>(doorbell chimes)
<p>Quinn - Don't anybody move.
<p>Jake - Charity bloodsuckers!
<p>Daria - No, it's the fashion bloodsuckers.
<p>Quinn - Everyone, please remain in your seats until my guests and I are all safely upstairs. Thank you. (leaves)
<p>Jake - How come Quinn never introduces us to her friends?
<p>Daria - Why don't you ask the little people who live in your potatoes?
<p>(Helen sighs)
<p>(in Quinn's bedroom)
<p>Quinn - So I was thinking, since we'll all be wearing designer dresses, we should have a fashion show theme. The dance floor could be on a runway and everyone could watch us from the sidelines.
<p>Stacy - That's a great idea!
<p>Tiffany - Yeah, really great, Quinn.
<p>Sandi - Yes, if you want to make a mockery of the runway by having the visually unacceptable waddle all over it.
<p>Tiffany - Oh, yeah.
<p>Stacy - Oh, right.
<p>Quinn - Okay, then... maybe since we're all wearing bronze, gold and copper dresses, we should have a bronze, gold and copper dance!
<p>Tiffany - Oh, yeah.
<p>Stacy - That's cool.
<p>Sandi - Great. Then everyone will know what we're wearing ahead of time, so no one will be surprised.
<p>Tiffany - Ooh, she has a point.
<p>Quinn - Gee, Sandi, since you don't like any of <i>my</i> ideas, maybe there's something <i>you'd</i> like to do.
<p>Sandi - I think we should decorate the gym like the inside of the Concorde.
<p>Quinn - Um, it's a cute idea and everything, but I'm not sure there would be much room to dance, and...
<p>Sandi - Gee, Quinn, if you're not going to listen to ideas from your own dance committee, maybe you should just plan the dance alone.
<p>Quinn - Don't be silly...
<p>Sandi - So now I'm silly?
<p>Quinn - I meant, it would be silly for <i>me</i> to plan the dance <i>alone</i> when I have such a talented committee. I know the four of us can come up with something really fun!
<p>Sandi - But I already did come up with something really fun.
<p>Quinn - But it's just... well, not practical.
<p>Sandi - Maybe I should just have my own party, since you obviously think I'm postal.
<p>Quinn - I don't think you're postal!
<p>Sandi - Come on. I know a really nice insane asylum.
<p>Stacy - Sandi, I think what Quinn meant is... (Sandi glares) Eep!
<p>Quinn - But I need you guys!
<p>Sandi - Then next time, maybe you'll act like it.
<p>Tiffany - Sorry, Quinn.
<p>(Sandi, Stacy and Tiffany leave)
<p>Quinn - Wait! Uh!

<p><hr>

<p>(in the hallway)
<p>Kevin - So, Angie, want to go to the dance with the Q.B.? I'll drive.
<p>Angie - No thanks, Kevin. I've got plans that night to... um, read a newspaper. (leaves)
<p>Kevin - Hmm... okay! (in come-on tone) Hey, Quinn...
<p>Quinn - (walks past) Not now.
<p>Kevin - Um, Daria? Can I ask you a personal question?
<p>Daria - No.
<p>Kevin - See, normally, I have no trouble in, you know, the babe department. But now, they're treating me like I'm on the honor roll or something.
<p>Jane - Kids can be so cruel.
<p>Kevin - I can't get one cheerleader to go to the dance with me. I don't get it.
<p>Jane - Maybe you're losing your looks.
<p>Daria - Or maybe you're losing your mind.
<p>Kevin - You think I'm losing my looks?
<p>Jane - A face-lift will fix you right up.
<p>Daria - Why do you have to go to the dance with a cheerleader?
<p>Kevin - It's not to make Brittany jealous, if that's what you think.
<p>Jane - I'm convinced.
<p>Daria - Cheer up. I'm sure there are plenty of non-cheerleaders who would be happy to waste three hours of their lives at a dance with you.
<p>Kevin - Oh, wait. I see where this is going. Hey, Daria, no offense, but no way. I mean, what are you thinking?
<p>Daria - Huh?
<p>Kevin - Gotta go. (leaves)
<p>Jane - (shouts) But what about the baby?!!
<p>(in Mr. O'Neill's classroom)
<p>Mr. O'Neill - (into mirror) Um, Ms. Barch? Janet? May I call you Janet? No? Oh, okay. Ms. Barch...
<p>Quinn - Hi.
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Eep!
<p>Quinn - I just wanted to tell you, um, my great-aunt Audrey died two days ago and I'm too upset to head the dance committee. You know, death and all. Okay, gotta go.
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Quinn, wait. If there's anything I can do to help you through this time of bereavement...
<p>Quinn - All right! So I don't have a great-aunt Audrey. Sandi, Stacy and Tiffany deserted me and no one else will help and I can't plan the dance all by myself!
<p>Mr. O'Neill - I see. You must be feeling a lot of teenage stress to make up such a fanciful story.
<p>Quinn - So I'm off the hook?
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Quinn, I've got a solution. I will be your dance committee!
<p>Quinn - Ewww! Fine! I'll find a new committee. (moans and leaves)
<p>Mr. O'Neill - (into mirror) Janet, please, don't think me forward or randy by asking you this, but...
<p>(at Pizza King)
<p>Brittany - So, anyway, I really love to dance. Of course, the best place to dance is at a dance. Do you like to dance?
<p>Football Player - Um, sure. (sees Kevin) I mean, no. No, no, no... no. (runs off)
<p>Brittany - (to Jodie) I can't believe it. No one has asked me to the dance! Am I losing my looks?
<p>Andrea - (walks past) They're gaining their senses.
<p>Brittany - What?
<p>Jodie - Brittany, I completely disapprove of this ridiculous fight with Kevin.
<p>Brittany - Oh...
<p>Jodie - But if you insist on teaching the big idiot a lesson, why not ask Robert to the dance?
<p>Brittany - But he's at DisneyWorld with his family till next Friday!
<p>Jodie - So he doesn't know about any of this. That's why he'll say yes, see?
<p>Brittany - Wow! Jodie, no wonder you're an honor student!
<p>Jodie - Yeah, all that note-taking and studying is just to kill time between my friends' romantic crises.
<p>Brittany - You ought to try watching TV. (leaves)
<p>Mack - Hey, what's she so happy about?
<p>Jodie - Nuttin', honey.
<p>Quinn - Hi, guys.
<p>(guys greet Quinn eagerly)
<p>Quinn - I was wondering if you could do me a teensy-weensy favor.
<p>Guys - I can do it. No problem!
<p>Quinn - Great! I need help planning the dance.
<p>Jeffy - (clears throat) Quinn, we'd like to help but, uh, you know... we're guys.
<p>Guys - Hey, Sandi.
<p>Sandi - Gee, I hope everyone here isn't too busy to come to the party I'm having while my parents are out of town.
<p>Guys - (cheering) Yeah, we're there!
<p>Sandi - Quinn, I just want to say that I'm really sorry about our fight. I don't even care who was at fault. I just hope you're not still mad.
<p>Quinn - I could never stay mad at you, Sandi.
<p>Sandi - Good. So you'll be at my party next Saturday. I mean, it wouldn't be the same without you, Quinn.
<p>Guys - (chanting) Saturday, Saturday, Saturday!
<p>Quinn - Saturday? But that's the same night as the dance.
<p>Guys - (chanting) Dance, dance, dance!
<p>Sandi - You're kidding! I forgot all about the dance. Gee, that's too, too bad. I mean, I can't un-order all that free pizza.
<p>Guys - Pizza? Cool!
<p>Quinn - Well, I can't un-order, um, the free soda and tacos I was going to order.
<p>Guys - Tacos? All right!
<p>Sandi - Outdoor turbo-jet hot tub.
<p>Quinn - Preferred seating for the popular.
<p>Sandi - Green Bay on big screen!
<p>Quinn - D.J. on dance floor!
<p>Sandi - Miniskirt!
<p>Quinn - Strapless!
<p>Both - (to guys) Well?!!
<p>Jeffy - My head hurts!
<p>Jamie - Mine, too.
<p>Joey - Oh, man!
<p>(guys groan)
<p>(at Daria's house)
<p>SSW Announcer - What deadly new diseases can you pick up by sitting down? Toilet seat terror next, on <i>Sick, Sad World.</i>
<p>Daria - Need someone to count it for you?
<p>Quinn - A hundred dollars. It's yours. All you have to do is be my dance committee.
<p>Daria - Put away the cash; I'll do it for free.
<p>Quinn - You will?!
<p>Daria - Sure. And after that, we can play Mystery Date and have a taffy pull.
<p>Quinn - (dramatically) My own flesh and blood, Daria. My own flesh and blood.
<p>Jane - Not so fast.
<p>Daria - What?
<p>Jane - What's the budget? You know, for food, music... decorations?
<p>Quinn - A thousand dollars... well, minus this discretionary fund.
<p>Jane - The time has come to reach out and bond with my fellow classmates. Organizing a dance is the best way to say "Jane Lane wants to be your friend."
<p>Quinn - Whatever. Let's divide everything up. This is what you're responsible for.
<p>Jane - Decorations, furniture rentals, food, music. You're in charge of, uh...?
<p>Quinn - Lots of things. Any questions?
<p>Jane - How many people...?
<p>Quinn - Oops, date's here. Gotta go! (leaves)
<p>Daria - Does this have any connection with that big art piece you want to do?
<p>Jane - A thousand dollars can buy a lot of paint.
<p>Daria - But what about our dancing classmates?
<p>Jane - Ah, put this aside for a bag of chips and a boombox.

<p><hr>

<p>(in Mr. O'Neill's classroom)
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Now, um, Janet, I know that you're... Jane! Thank you for stopping by.
<p>Jane - (sleepy) Sorry, late. No sleep two days. (collapses on desk)
<p>Mr. O'Neill - By the way, did Quinn give you my list of suggestions?
<p>Jane - (sleepy) Who?
<p>Mr. O'Neill - I just thought a dramatic reading would be a nice break. You know, in between all the "rocking out"...
<p>(Jane snores)
<p>(at the dance)
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Um, Janet... I mean, Miss Janet. Ooh! No! That is...
<p>Ms. Barch - Come on, skinny, let's dance!
<p>Jodie - See how the hands grip the steering wheel, like he still thinks he could drive his way out of it?
<p>Mack - Yeah. Maybe he could if his arms were attached.
<p>Daria - I hate to tell you this, but your conceptual piece is a big hit.
<p>Jane - Couldn't just let me enjoy the moment, could you? Althought I am impressed you braved a high school dance to support the arts.
<p>Daria - I've come, I've seen, let's go.
<p>Upchuck - And now, ladies, take your man by the hand and climb aboard the roller-coaster to love. (growls)
<p>Daria - You made Upchuck the deejay?
<p>Jane - I figured it was best to keep him out of circulation. Plus, he had all the right qualifications.
<p>Daria - He volunteered.
<p>Jane - Bingo.
<p>(Quinn enters with Corey and another guy)
<p>Quinn - I can't believe Mr. O'Neill said he'd give me detention if I didn't come to this stupid dance. I mean, have you seen the way people dress in detention?
<p>(both agree with Quinn)
<p>Quinn - Oh, no! What did she do to the gym? Guys, I'm really thirsty. Can you get me some punch <i>now?</i> (to Jane) What's this about?
<p>Jane - Being young, carefree, having your whole life ahead of you and dancing the night away to celebrate. Oh, and the untimely death of Jackson Pollock.
<p>Quinn - Great! Some friend of yours bites it in a car crash and you take it out on me. My life is over, okay?
<p>Daria - You've done well.
<p>Corey - Cool decorations, Quinn.
<p>Quinn - Really?
<p>Guy - Yeah. You're a really good painter.
<p>Quinn - Thanks! Come on, let's dance.
<p>Corey - Which one of us?
<p>Quinn - Both, silly!
<p>Upchuck - And if you luscious lovelies out there are wondering what effect you have on Charles Ruttheimer III why... you make me want to shout!
<p>Jane - She's gonna take all the credit, isn't she?
<p>Daria - It's the thing she does best. That, and avoiding lipstick teeth.
<p>Brittany - Doesn't Robert look handsome tonight?
<p>Mack - Stunning.
<p>Robert - Thank you, ma'am.
<p>Brittany - So, where's Kevin? Not that I care.
<p>Jodie - He's at Sandi's party.
<p>Brittany - (whimpers) Come, Robert, let us dance!
<p>Robert - Yes, ma'am.
<p>(at Sandi's house)
<p>TV Announcer - And so, while the Broncos remain snowbound outside Denver International Airport, we're pleased to bring you this encore presentation of "50 Years of Off-Broadway Choreography."
<p>Jamie - (turns TV off) Guys, this, um, uh...
<p>Jeffy - Sucks?
<p>Jamie - Yeah.
<p>Joey - Hey Sandi, is Quinn coming over?
<p>Kevin - And where's Brittany? Not that I care.
<p>Sandi - I believe they're at the dance. You know, with the losers. Now, who wants to try out those new jets in my hot tub?
<p>Jeffy - Um, I'll go change.
<p>(guys sneak out)
<p>(at the dance)
<p>Girl - They look terrible out there.
<p>Angie - We have to tell her for her own good.
<p>Brittany - Isn't Robert a dreamy dancer? Much better than Kevin.
<p>Angie - Brittany, honey... (whispering) your date dances like a big geek and I thought you should know.
<p>(Brittany squeals and runs off)
<p>Jane - Uh-oh. We've been spotted.
<p>Daria - Well, I don't feel like talking to anyone.
<p>Jane - That's a shocker. Don't worry, I'll get rid of them.
<p>Brad - Hi. Cool decorations, huh?
<p>Jane - Have a seat.
<p>Daria - That's telling them.
<p>Brad - I'm Brad, and this is my brother, Brett. We're from Cumberland High.
<p>Jane - What are you doing here?
<p>Brett - We travel around on weekends trying to find a high school more screwed up than ours.
<p>Jane - And?
<p>Brad - Congratulations. Your trophy will arrive in six to ten business days.
<p>Upchuck - Now let's slow things down so we can heat things up, if you get my drift. (growls)
<p>(Quinn's dates both try to slow dance with her)
<p>Quinn - Ewww! (pushes them away) Get your big, sweaty hands off of me! I don't slow dance until after the fifth date. (runs outside)
<p>Jeffy - Hi, Quinn. Want to dance?
<p>Joey - Dance with me first!
<p>Quinn - How come you guys aren't at Sandi's party?
<p>Jamie - It, um...
<p>Joey - Sucked.
<p>Jamie - Sucked.
<p>Quinn - Gee, that's too, too bad.
<p>Robert - I'm sorry you're not feeling well, ma'am. Are you hungry ? Can I drive you anywhere? Uh, how about...
<p>Brittany - Thanks, Robert, but I just want to go home.
<p>Robert - I got you the wrong color corsage, didn't i? (Kevin drives up) If the chocolates were too chocolate, just tell me.
<p>(Brittany grabs Robert in a lip-lock)
<p>Brett - You know, we really should say something about that guacamole on the floor before someone else sprains their ankle.
<p>Daria - Yeah, we really should.
<p>Jane - Mmm.
<p>Brad - So, I was reading this book on Jeffrey Dahmer...
<p>(in the parking lot)
<p>Robert - Hey, Kevin! (Kevin grabs Robert) Oof!
<p>Kevin - No one messes with my girlfriend but me! Die!
<p>(Kevin and Robert begin fighting)
<p>Quinn - Boy, those guys must really like Brittany a lot to fight over her.
<p>Jamie - Hey! What's the big idea taking Quinn to the dance?
<p>Joey - Yeah, that's our job!
<p>(Three J's begin fighting with Corey and Quinn's other date)
<p>Quinn - Oh, dear.
<p>(at Sandi's house)
<p>Sandi - Where are all the guys? I mean, how long does it take them to change?
<p>Tiffany - I heard a bunch of cars leaving earlier.
<p>Sandi - Well, why didn't you say anything?!
<p>Tiffany - I figured they belonged to a really big family.
<p>Stacy - Ew, look! I'm getting all pruney!
<p>Sandi - Stacy, that is so unattractive. I can't believe you even showed me. Come on, let's change and go to the dance... unless Stacy has something else really gross to show us.
<p>(Sandi pulls on locked door while Sam and Chris watch TV)
<p>(at the dance)
<p>Brad - So, you guys want to go to Joe's Diner? The food's inedible and one of the waiters is a schizophrenic.
<p>Jane - Think we can we get in?
<p>Brett - Cool. Let me tell Chuck so he can meet up with us later.
<p>Daria - Wait, you're friends with Upchuck?
<p>Brad - He's our cousin. We came to see his D.J. act.
<p>(Brett growls like Upchuck)
<p>Jane - Um, I think I have to be somewhere...
<p>Daria - I just remembered an appointment on the other side of town...
<p>(Jane and Daria retreat)
<p>(in the parking lot)
<p>Brittany - Oh, Kevvy, I only kissed Robert to get even with you for kissing Zoe, it didn't mean anything, and now I know you do love me and you really mean it when you say smart doesn't matter, although I think I'm smarter than you think I am, although I know I'm not smarter than the really smart-smart people, so I forgive you! Kevvy? Kevvy?
<p>(Kevin mumbles)
<p>Paramedic - Son, I wouldn't try to talk with that broken jaw.
<p>Brittany - A broken jaw? For me? (kisses Kevin)
<p>(Kevin screams)
<p>(walking home from the dance)
<p>Daria - Let's do the math one more time. Your dance decorations were a huge hit.
<p>Jane - Plus.
<p>Daria - But my sister managed to take complete credit for them.
<p>Jane - Minus.
<p>Daria - We hung out with a couple of guys who weren't so bad.
<p>Jane - Plus.
<p>Daria - But they turned out to be carriers of the dreaded Ruttheimer gene.
<p>Jane - Big minus.
<p>Daria - So, we're more or less even on the night.
<p>Jane - Darn. And it came so close to turning out semi-decent.
<p>(snow begins to fall)
<p>Sandi - (pounds on door) Come on, you little punk, open up! Open this door! You little brat!
<p>Tiffany - Oh, my God, let us in! Hello?
<p>(Stacy whimpers)
<p>Both - Plus!
<p>(closing credits)
