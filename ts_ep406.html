<p><i>(opening theme song)</i>
<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(Daria is watching television in the living room)</i>
<p>SSW Announcer - Can you teach an old dog to turn tricks? Ruff! Canine call girls, next on <i>Sick, Sad World.</i>
<p><i>(Quinn enters living room)</i>
<p>Quinn - Daria, have you seen my new <u>Teenage Superstars</u> magazine?
<p>Daria - I couldn't help myself. I've plastered my walls with its hot, sexy pinups.
<p>Quinn - I'll ask Mom.
<p><i>(Quinn walks towards kitchen as Helen enters living room)</i>
<p>Helen - Daria, have you seen your father?
<p>Daria - Did you look under the <u>Teenage Superstars</u> magazine?
<p>Helen - I'll ask Quinn.
<p><i>(Helen heads into the kitchen; moments later, both she and Quinn walk past Daria; both are talking at once)</i>
<p>Quinn - ...need some money for new clothes for the standardized testing 'cause I hate filling in those little circles...
<p>Helen - ...wasting time reading junk when you could be enjoying a good book. Now, did you see your father? When was the last time you saw him?...
<p><i>(the door closes behind them, leaving Daria alone at last... until Jake's voice calls out)</i>
<p>Jake <i>(O.S.)</i> - Hello? Anybody? Please?
<p><i>(Daria heads upstairs, and stops outside the upstairs bathroom)</i>
<p>Jake <i>(O.S.)</i> - Is anybody out there? Am I the only one left in the house?
<p>Daria - If I help you with the first question, will you try to do the second one on your own?
<p>Jake <i>(O.S.)</i> - Daria! Thank God! Your mother's at her work thing and Quinn's at her school thing and... I thought I'd be stuck in here forever.
<p>Daria - Okay, listen closely. There's a knob on the door. Turn it counterclockwise.
<p>Jake <i>(O.S.)</i> - We're all out of toilet paper, kiddo! Would you believe it?
<p>Daria - Oh. Well, I'll go grab some from downstairs.
<p>Jake <i>(O.S.)</i> - There <i>isn't</i> any downstairs. That's why I ran up <i>here</i>. Damn heart-smart chili!
<p>Daria - I see. Walking away now with too much information.
<p>Jake <i>(O.S.)</i> - Kiddo, could you hurry over to Drugs N' Stuff and pick up a few rolls?
<p>Daria - I get stuck on the hurry part.
<p>Jake <i>(O.S.)</i> - Damn it. How in hell would Helen handle this? How in hell would Helen... hey, I bet that's one of those backwards-and-forward things! No, I guess not.
<p>Daria - I can hear you, you know. And she'd offer me a bribe.
<p>Jake <i>(O.S.)</i> - Yeah! If you can make it back in 15 minutes, I'll give you five bucks.
<p>Daria - A decent bribe.
<p>Jake <i>(O.S.)</i> - Twenty!
<p>Daria - You're on. See you in a few minutes. <i>(leaves)</i>
<p>Jake <i>(O.S.)</i> - Hurry, kiddo! This <u>Teenage Superstars</u> magazine is only 64 pages!
<p><i>(at Drugs N' Stuff)</i>
<p><i>(Daria is standing in line, holding a package of toilet paper)</i>
<p>Daria <i>(thinking)</i> - Ten minutes. I'll never make it home in time to get that 20. Of course, I could always turn back all the clocks in the house, but how will I get to his wristwatch? I wonder if they sell chloroform here.
<p>Woman - Next. Can I help you, dear?
<p>Daria - No, I just came to enjoy your reenactment of the fall of Saigon.
<p>Woman - You mean the crowd? Well, what do you expect on homecoming night?
<p>Daria - Homecoming night?
<p>Woman - Everyone in town is lining up to see the parade.
<p><i>(Daria goes outside, and indeed, a parade is going down the street; walking outside, she sees a group of kids, led by Ms. Defoe, painting Lawndale Lions slogans on the storefront)</i>
<p>Ms. Defoe - Now, really look inside your work, and ask: in focusing so intently on my subject, have I neglected my negative space? <i>(turns and sees Daria)</i> Daria! Have you seen Jane?
<p>Daria - Not lately.
<p>Ms. Defoe - I was hoping she might help us paint windows. We need her color sense.
<p><i>(suddenly, two kids get into a paint fight)</i>
<p>Gary <i>(O.S.)</i> - CeCe, I'm going to throw paint on you!
<p>CeCe <i>(O.S.)</i> - Now, Gary, don't you dare!
<p>Ms. Defoe - No, people. Treasure you medium. <i>(goes after the kids)</i>
<p>Daria - Must get home... must get home...
<p><i>(squeezing through the crowd to stand at the curb, Daria looks on as a large float of a football player holding a penguin's head goes by; part of the head falls off, nearly crushing her as she stumbles back)</i>
<p>Daria - Ah!
<p><i>(a camera flashes in her eyes; the picture is of Daria wincing at the bright light)</i>
<p>Jane - You'll pay through the nose for that shot, missy. Unless you can give me a plausible reason for your being here.
<p>Daria - I was having too much fun at home, so I thought I'd go out and get killed by an unstable parade float.
<p>Jane - Yep, through the nose.
<p>Daria - I'd stay and talk, but I've got 20 bucks riding on my quick escape. Join me?
<p>Jane - Got a date... with a thoughtless delinquent.
<p>Daria - You're meeting Tom <i>here</i>?
<p>Jane - What better place than a high school homecoming to chronicle the anarchic death spiral of Western society?
<p>Daria - So your date consists of making fun of people.
<p>Jane - If you must be all simplistic about it. And you're here because...
<p>Daria - My dad sent me on an emergency errand and I got stranded.
<p><i>(Jane looks in the bag and sees the toilet paper)</i>
<p>Jane - I'm betting <i>he's</i> stranded, too. Oh, look! <i>(sees the cheerleading squad walk past)</i> Hope you have time for a cheer before you go.
<p>Brittany - Okay, girls, let's pump up the spirit. <i>(cheering)</i> Who's the team that's number one? Lawndale! Lawndale! Who's the team that's lots of fun? Lawndale! Lawndale! <i>(Lisa and Nikki grab Brittany and hoist her in the air)</i> Go... football!
<p><i>(as the crowd applauds, Brittany looks at the football team's float, where Kevin and Angie are standing on the platform; as the girls set her down on the ground, Kevin puts his arm around Angie's shoulders)</i>
<p>Brittany - Hmm!
<p>Angie - Kevin, maybe we shouldn't be so friendly up here.
<p>Kevin - Relax, babe. You're the football sweetheart and I'm the Q.B. I'm supposed to be touching you and stuff. It's the law.
<p>Angie - But Brittany's my friend, and she's right there.
<p>Kevin - Hey, we're elected officials. It's like manifold destiny.
<p>Robert - Um, Kevin? We're all supposed to be throwing candy.
<p>Kevin - Cool!
<p><i>(the football players start hurling candy at the crowd at high velocity, causing people to duck and cry out in pain; among them are Sandi Griffin's brothers, Sam and Chris)</i>
<p>Chris - Check it out -- I'll catch it in my mouth. <i>(a piece of candy hits him in the head and knocks him over)</i> Ow!
<p>Daria - That's it. When the candy reaches escape velocity, it's time to leave.
<p>Jane - Where the hell is Tom? He was supposed to be here 15 minutes ago.
<p>Daria - I wouldn't let it bother you. Just because he's a few minutes late doesn't mean he's an inconsiderate jerk who will ultimately bring you nothing but misery.
<p>Jane - I'm glad you're starting to warm to him.
<p>Daria - I need to cross this street now if I want to make it home before the next ice age. See you. <i>(leaves)</i>
<p>Jane - Godspeed, Indiana Morgendorffer.
<p><i>(Daria starts to cross, but is restrained by Ms. Li)</i>
<p>Ms. Li - Ms. Morgendorffer, where do you think you're going?
<p>Daria - Slowly insane. But I need to pop in at home first.
<p>Ms. Li - As principal of Lawndale High, I can't just permit spectators to cross a parade route.
<p>Daria - Right. Isn't that how World War I started?
<p>Ms. Li - If you were to get impaled on a float or sexually harassed by a clown, things could get ugly.
<p>Daria - Things already have, but I don't have time to debate this right now. <i>(leaves)</i>
<p>Ms. Li <i>(into tape recorder)</i> - Crowd control inadequate. Next year, consider electric fences.
<p>Daria <i>(thinking)</i> - I can still make it back in time. All I need is a catapult and a good tailwind.
<p><i>(suddenly, she runs into the Lawndale Lions mascot: a guy in a lion costume)</i>
<p>Mascot - Rah, rah, rah! We're number one!
<p>Daria - Um, I think the roaring '20s are back that way.
<p>Mascot - Let's do the Lawndale shuffle.
<p>Daria - How about the "get the hell away from me" slide?
<p><i>(the mascot starts to dance, then suddenly begins swaying on his feet)</i>
<p>Mascot - My head's too big.
<p>Daria - That's because it's so full of dreams.
<p><i>(the mascot falls to the ground)</i>
<p>Mascot - <i>(weakly)</i> Rah, rah, rah. Please help me up.
<p><i>(several people start to help the mascot to his feet as Daria walks away, headed for the street once again)</i>
<p>Daria - Ms. Li's gone. I'm out of here.
<p><i>(Daria then hears a child crying; looking over towards the sound, she sees a tearful Tad Gupty)</i>
<p>Daria - Tad?
<p>Tad - Daria? Oh, Daria, I'm scared!
<p><i>(Daria glances at the parade, where a cutesy kitty float is going past)</i>
<p>Daria - So am I. Where are your mom and dad?
<p>Tad - I don't know. I saw a windmill in the toy store window so I went to look, because they're such a clean source of energy, and when I turned around, everyone was gone. Now I'm frightened I'll be stuck in this parade forever.
<p>Daria - I know the feeling. Let's find you a cop.
<p>Tad - Oh, no. My dad says police officers too often utilize excessive force in their quest for efficient pacification.
<p>Daria - And I'm sure your father has had more than his share of scrapes with John Law.
<p>Tad - Won't <i>you</i> stay with me, Daria?
<p><i>(Daria wants to get going, but she can't resist the tearful, pleading look on Tad's face)</i>
<p>Daria - <i>(sighs)</i> Come on. Much to my surprise, my conscience tells me I should help you find your parents. <i>(grabs his hand and starts walking)</i>
<p>Tad - Hooray! With you along, this'll be an exciting adventure, like the travels of Babar.
<p>Daria - Easy on the elephant comparisons, kid.
<p><i>(both she and Tad are suddenly set upon by several kids spraying Silly String, and wind up liberally coated with the stuff)</i>
<p>Daria - Stupid conscience.

<p><hr>

<p><i>(at the parade)</i>
<p><i>(Daria and Tad are walking along the parade route)</i>
<p>Tad - What's your favorite part of the parade, Daria?
<p>Daria - The thigh... no, wait, the drumstick.
<p>Tad - Oh. I like the clowns.
<p>Daria - Of course you do. Keep looking for your parents.
<p>Tad - I also like it when they throw candy from the floats.
<p>Daria - Since when do <i>you</i> eat candy? You told me it was poison.
<p>Tad - Oh, it is, but every piece I catch is one cavity some other boy or girl will never get. That's what makes it so rewarding.
<p>Daria - Tad, when you brush your teeth, do you ever scrub right through to your brain?
<p>Tad - Oh, look! Do you think <i>he'll</i> be throwing candy from <i>his</i> car?
<p><i>(Upchuck approaches in his garish "Love Machine" convertible; when he spots Daria, he honks the horn, which plays the opening notes of "Also Sprach Zarathustra")</i>
<p>Daria - No, that car has things thrown <i>at</i> it.
<p>Upchuck - Do my eyes deceive me? The divine Ms. Mmm... and who may I ask is your young suitor?
<p>Tad - I'm not supposed to give my name to strange people.
<p>Daria - And they don't come any stranger than this.
<p>Upchuck - So quick to dismiss. I like that... for a while. But you'll change your tune when you see what I've done with the back seat. Does the notion of satin upholstery get you excited?
<p>Daria - Sure, if it's lining your coffin.
<p>Upchuck - Grr, feisty! I'll be parked at the end of the parade route, gorgeous. So remember, if the Love Machine's rocking, by all means, come-a-knocking!
<p><i>(Upchuck pulls away with another honk of his horn, and as Daria and Tad head for the sidewalk, they spot Tom standing in front of the pharmacy)</i>
<p>Tom - Daria?
<p>Daria - <i>(eyes narrow)</i> Oh. Tom. Aren't you supposed to be with Jane? She was waiting for you in front of Drugs N' Stuff.
<p>Tom - Oh. She just said to meet at the pharmacy. I thought she meant the other one. I guess it was just a big misunderstanding.
<p>Daria - That's what Pol Pot said.
<p>Tom - He didn't mean to kill two million people. He only wanted to scare them.
<p><i>(in spite of herself, Daria manages a small smile)</i>
<p>Tom - Anyway, who's this?
<p>Daria - Tad. Former baby-sitting job. He's lost, and we're looking for his parents.
<p>Tom - <i>(kneels)</i> Hiya, Tad, I'm Tom. Mind if I tag along with you guys?
<p>Daria - Actually, we'd be better off...
<p>Tad - We're both headed back toward Drugs N' Stuff. We can help each other.
<p>Daria - If you really want to walk with us, fine, but I don't think you'll find Jane. I've never seen this street so crowded before.
<p>Tom - It is a stunning array of pod people. It's times like these I'm glad I don't go to your school.
<p>Daria - Uh-huh. And I suppose <i>your</i> ivy-choked prep school is any better? <i>(pause)</i> Wait a minute. Was I just defending Lawndale?
<p>Tom - You know, I think you were.
<p>Daria - We never had this conversation.
<p>Tom - What conversation?
<p><i>(meanwhile, the Fashion Club float trundles down the parade route; the girls wave from atop the float)</i>
<p>Quinn - All this waving is making my arm tired. Isn't there something else we can do?
<p>Sandi - There was, until <i>someone</i> handed out all our head shots at once.
<p>Stacy - I didn't mean to. Oh, I should have paced myself better.
<p>Tiffany - We should do something that showcases our, like, charity and stuff.
<p>Sandi - Perhaps we could select a less fortunate girl from the audience and give her a makeover.
<p>Quinn - That is such a good idea, Sandi.
<p><i>(Daria, Tad, and Tom are still walking)</i>
<p>Tom - Maybe we should hop a float. We could see more people that way, and more people could see us.
<p>Daria - One: I don't hop floats. Two: I don't hop.
<p>Tom - Come on, Daria. You gotta embrace the nightmare. Don't you want to wave to the crowd?
<p>Daria - Look, Tom, I know that you and Jane see this whole thing as a big joke, but that's not me. <i>(she spots Quinn waving from the float)</i> I stand corrected. This whole thing <i>is</i> a big joke.
<p>Sandi - Um, Quinn? Isn't that your relative or whatever walking toward us?
<p><i>(Sandi points to the street, where Daria, Tom, and Tad are following the float)</i>
<p>Quinn - Oh, no. <i>(to the front of the float)</i> Okay, we need to speed up now.
<p><i>(at the front of the float, Joey, Jeffy, and Jamie -- who are pulling the float down the street -- start complaining rather strongly)</i>
<p>Tiffany - This is perfect. We can make <i>her</i> over.
<p>Stacy - Wow! The crowd will be amazed.
<p><i>(Tom and Tad hop onto the float)</i>
<p>Daria - Wait, not <i>that</i> float.
<p>Tad - Daria! Come on! Don't leave me! <i>(starts crying)</i> Daria!
<p><i>(irritated, Daria rushes over and is helped onto the float by Tom)</i>
<p>Daria - Okay, we looked. Now let's get down before...
<p><i>(Sandi and Stacy yank her up to the top of the float)</i>
<p>Sandi - We'll need to apply some base. But first, some pre-base.
<p>Stacy - Do you want to use my scrunchie? <i>Please</i> use my scrunchie.
<p>Tiffany - I'll take the "before" picture.
<p><i>(Tiffany snaps a photo, which shows a definitely unwilling Daria trapped in Fashion Club hell)</i>
<p><i>(Daria grabs Quinn and uses her as a shield)</i>
<p>Daria - Call them off... or I start hugging you.
<p>Quinn - You wouldn't dare!
<p>Daria - Try me.
<p><i>(Quinn stares back at her Fashion Club friends, a look of pure horror on her face)</i>
<p><i>(elsewhere, Mack and Jodie are on the Homecoming King and Queen float)</i>
<p>Jodie - Isn't it great how they keep electing us Homecoming King and Queen every year?
<p>Mack - Yes, it's such a generous and enlightened gesture. It completely makes up for the town's utter lack of diversity, in <i>my</i> mind.
<p>Jodie - And we're playing into it.
<p>Mack - Damn college applications.
<p>Jodie - This is so humiliating.
<p><i>(on the Fashion Club float)</i>
<p>Quinn - This is so humiliating! Let go of me!
<p>Daria - Not until she holsters that hair spray.
<p>Sandi - Um, Quinn's cousin or whatever? Could you just let us pull your hair back? It won't, like, hurt.
<p>Tad - That product was tested on bunnies and kitties!
<p>Quinn - It was?!
<p>Sandi - Duh... that's why we use it. So those cute animals didn't suffer in vain.
<p>Quinn - Oh.
<p>Tad - You're a mean old witch.
<p>Sandi - I am not old!
<p>Tad - You're mean...
<p>Sandi - I am not old...
<p>Stacy - Quinn, your friend and her friends aren't getting into the spirit.
<p>Quinn - They shouldn't even be <i>up</i> here.
<p>Daria - <i>There's</i> a news flash. We're looking for Tad's parents. Have you seen them?
<p>Quinn - No. Now get down.
<p>Daria - Come on, Tad. Enough of this ivory tower. Back to the streets.
<p>Tad - You don't respect other species' rights.
<p>Sandi - Shove it, veggie boy. <i>(sprays Tad as he jumps off the float)</i>
<p>Tiffany - That girl just doesn't know what's good for her.
<p>Quinn - Tell me about it.
<p><i>(on the sidewalk)</i>
<p>Tad - Wait till I tell my parents I was on a real live float <i>and</i> I met an animal abuser.
<p>Daria - Uh-oh. The animals are about to exact their revenge.
<p><i>(the Lawndale Lions mascot rushes towards them)</i>
<p>Mascot - Here we go, Lawndale, here we go!
<p>Daria - Didn't I just leave you for dead a while ago? Beat it.
<p>Mascot - Come on, let's have a cheer!
<p>Tom - She said beat it, Leo! <i>(shoves the mascot away)</i>
<p>Daria - Wow. That was the modern equivalent of laying your cape over a puddle of water for me.
<p>Tom - Well, I don't know you well enough to wear my cape around you. <i>(pause)</i> Wait a minute, was that a smile I just saw?
<p>Daria - A twitch... more of a tic, really.
<p>Tom - I <i>knew</i> you were having fun. Why hide it? You need to learn how to laugh out loud at the ridiculous horror of all this. Look -- cheerleaders!
<p><i>(Brittany is leading the squad in another cheer)</i>
<p>Brittany <i>(cheering)</i> - The Lions can't be beat! They're lightning on their feet! They're the best team on our street... or lots of other streets.
<p><i>(on the football float, Kevin's hand wanders down to Angie's butt)</i>
<p>Brittany - He touched her butt. Did anyone else see? He touched her butt! Okay, Mr. Busy Hands. Let's see how your team does without cheerleaders to back you up!
<p><i>(the squad starts walking away... right into the path of the unstable "kill the penguins" float)</i>
<p>Driver - Uh-oh!
<p>Passenger - They're coming right for us! Turn, turn!
<p>Driver - It's not designed to turn so fast!
<p><i>(with a squeal of tires, the float narrowly avoids the cheerleaders and the crowd as it topples over; the driver and his buddy barely get out in time to avoid the car exploding)</i>
<p>Daria - Wow.
<p>Tom - It's like the <i>Hindenburg</i>.
<p>Daria - Oh, the lack of humanity.
<p><i>(the crowd cheers and applauds as fire fighters arrive to put out the blaze)</i>
<p>Daria - This is magnificent. <i>When Homecoming Parades Turn Hellish.</i>
<p>Tom - Now, aren't you glad you were here to see this?
<p>Daria - Well, I definitely understand why you wanted to share this with Jane. Sorry you never hooked up.
<p>Tom - It's okay. By now she'd be so busy snapping pictures she'd forget I was even here. You know how she is.
<p>Daria - Yeah, I know how she is.
<p>Tom - Thanks for getting lost in the moment with me.
<p>Daria - Um, you're welcome?
<p>Tom - What do you think of all this, Tad? <i>(looks around)</i> Tad? Tad?
<p>Daria - Oh, no.
<p>Tom - He couldn't have gone far.
<p>Daria - Did we pass any windmills?

<p><hr>

<p><i>(at the parade)</i>
<p><i>(Daria and Tom are walking the parade route once again, this time in search of Tad; they wind up in front of Drugs N' Stuff)</i>
<p>Daria - Tad? Tad Gupty?
<p>Tom - I was holding his hand last, Daria. I'll take responsibility.
<p><i>(on the Homecoming King and Queen float)</i>
<p><i>(Mack and Jodie, disgusted with their "token African Americans" status, are sitting down rather than standing and waving)</i>
<p>Mack - Maybe we should start waving again.
<p>Jodie - Why play into this stupid charade any more than we have to?
<p>Mack - We don't have to do anything. Hell, we don't have to be up here.
<p>Jodie - That's actually a good point. What's the worst they could do to us?
<p><i>(Jodie looks over at the crowd and sees a young black girl waving at them, pride evident in her eyes; seeing this, Jodie softens, stands, and starts waving again)</i>
<p>Mack - What happened?
<p>Jodie - Oh, what the hell. We may be tokens, but we're damn good-looking ones.
<p>Mack - Can't argue with that. <i>(he also stands and resumes waving)</i> Hey... is that Daria?
<p>Jodie - What's <i>she</i> doing at a homecoming parade?
<p>Daria - Tad? Tad? I can't believe this.
<p>Tom - Hey, it could be worse.
<p>Daria - Let's see... in the past half-hour, I've lost the chance to make 20 bucks, lost my dignity on a float, and, oh, yeah... I lost a seven-year-old child.
<p>Tom - Weren't you also carrying some toilet paper before?
<p>Daria - Yeah. Okay, <i>now</i> I'm angry.
<p>Tad <i>(O.S.)</i> - Daria! Tom! I found my parents! They were looking for me!
<p><i>(the Gupty family approaches Daria and Tom; Lester is holding Tad in his arms)</i>
<p>Lauren - Of course we were looking for you, honey. We were so worried. Daria, Tad told us all about how you stayed with him.
<p>Lester - How can we ever repay you?
<p>Daria - I hear uncut diamonds are as good as cash on the open market.
<p><i>(Lester and Lauren both laugh)</i>
<p>Lauren - Yes, well, thank you, Daria. The next time you baby-sit, we'll be sure to have some extra carrot sticks in the fridge, just for you!
<p>Lester - Come on, honey, Daria here is a hero. I say we get her some dried fruit.
<p>Daria - My cup runneth over.
<p>Tricia - Mom! Dad! We're missing the parade!
<p>Lauren - Well, I guess we'd better find a good spot. Thanks again, Daria. <i>(they leave)</i>
<p>Daria - Um, this is where I saw Jane before, but she's not here now.
<p>Tom - We've done what we can. I wouldn't stress about it. We're having a good time, right?
<p><i>(suddenly, they're once again accosted by the Lawndale Lions mascot, who seems to be in some distress)</i>
<p>Mascot <i>(muffled)</i> - Help... me...
<p>Daria - Not <i>you</i> again.
<p>Tom - Remember us? We're the ones who <i>don't</i> enjoy your hilarious antics.
<p>Mascot <i>(muffled)</i> - Can't... breathe...
<p>Tom - What's he saying?
<p>Daria - It's either "canned beef" or "can't breathe."
<p><i>(the mascot collapses)</i>
<p>Daria - The latter.
<p><i>(Daria and Tom pull the mascot's head off, revealing him to be Mr. O'Neill)</i>
<p>Mr. O'Neill <i>(gasping)</i> - Hello? Where am I? Oh...
<p>Daria - I can't believe it. It's Mr. O'Neill.
<p>Tom - And he would have gotten away with it if it weren't for us meddling kids.
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Oh, my... whenever I cut loose, I always go overboard. Oh... <i>(chuckles)</i>
<p><i>(meanwhile, the Fashion Club float has stopped)</i>
<p>Quinn - Get going!
<p>Jeffy - We can't.
<p>Joey - The parade stopped moving again.
<p>Sandi - We can't just stay here forever. The same people have been staring at us for too long.
<p>Tiffany - It's like looking into the sun. It's like, really pretty? But if you do it for too long, you get wrinkles.
<p>Stacy - Yeah. It kind of hurts, too.
<p>Quinn - Move! Move, you big, ugly vehicles!
<p><i>(the cars in front rev their engines, covering the Fashion Club with soot and engine exhaust)</i>
<p>All - Eww...! <i>(start muttering angrily)</i>
<p><i>(up ahead, two female cops are flanking Upchuck, who is checking under the hood of his stalled "Love Machine")</i>
<p>Upchuck - I don't understand. Maybe the electric blanket is putting undue stress on the battery.
<p>Cop #2 - I don't care what your excuse is, Don Guano. You need to roll this car out of the way right now.
<p>Upchuck - That's the spirit. Let your blood boil.
<p>Cop #1 - You're holding up the parade. Now get out of here, or we put on the cuffs.
<p>Upchuck - Grr! Feisty.
<p><i>(the cops grab Upchuck, who yells and moans as they start beating him with their nightsticks)</i>
<p>Tom - They're gonna kill him.
<p>Daria - Let's not get our hopes up.
<p><i>(Both laugh, then wince as Ted DeWitt-Clinton snaps a photo of them; the photo shows a surprised Daria and a bewildered Tom)</i>
<p>Ted - Thanks, Daria. It's for the yearbook. I'm getting some really great pictures of couples tonight. <i>(leaves)</i>
<p>Daria - No, Ted, we're not a...
<p>Tom - I don't even go to this school.
<p>Jane <i>(O.S.)</i> - Well, it's about stinking time.
<p><i>(Jane approaches)</i>
<p>Tom - We've been looking all over for you.
<p>Jane - What do you mean, been looking?
<p>Daria - Tom and I ran into each other. We've been up and down the entire parade route.
<p>Jane - Together? And yet, no torn clothes? No blood? No missing organs?
<p>Tom - No, we got along... pretty well. Right, Daria?
<p>Daria - Right. I guess.
<p>Jane - I said to meet at Drugs N' Stuff. Where were you, you big dope?
<p>Tom - No, you said at the pharmacy.
<p>Daria - He was at the other one waiting for you. That's where I met him... ran into him.
<p>Jane - Mm-hmm. I tried there, too. You guys must have left before I got there, I guess,
<p>Tom - I guess.
<p>Jane - Well, come on. Let's get some pizza and compare battle scars. <i>(grabs Tom's arm and starts walking)</i> Come on, Daria!
<p><i>(Daria hesitates, then starts to join them just as the paint-fighting Gary and CeCe arrive)</i>
<p>CeCe - Oh, my gosh! This is so much fun! <i>(laughs)</i>
<p><i>(Daria is suddenly caught in the crossfire, and is splashed with blue and yellow paint)</i>
<p>CeCe - Oops, sorry.
<p>Gary - We're having a paint fight. Whoo!
<p><i>(Gary and CeCe run off, leaving behind a paint-splattered Daria)</i>
<p>Jane - Oh, no, civilian casualties. You look great, Daria.
<p>Tom - I can't believe this? Are you okay?
<p>Daria - I'm...
<p>Tom - Here, take my jacket. Wish I'd worn my cape.
<p>Jane - Huh?
<p>Daria - No, I'm fine. Really, I've always wanted an amazing Technicolor dreamcoat.
<p>Jane - I've trained her well. Never fear paint.
<p>Tom - Come on, Daria. We'll stop by your house and you can shower and change before we head out.
<p>Jane - No, come out like that, Daria. Shake up your image.
<p>Daria - You know, why don't you two just go on ahead? I think I'll skip the pizza tonight. I need to go talk to Pharaoh about his dreams.
<p>Jane - Aw, come on.
<p>Tom - Yeah, come on, Daria.
<p>Daria - I'm kind of beat.
<p>Tom - Okay, see you around.
<p>Jane - I'll call you later.
<p><i>(Jane and Tom walk away, but Tom steals a look over his shoulder at Daria, who -- despite her protestations -- is a vision of misery and loneliness)</i>
<p><i>(Mr. O'Neill approaches, still in costume but with the helmet off)</i>
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Well, I never would have believed it. Look at you, Daria. All decked out in the Lawndale colors. I knew if you just gave school spirit a chance, you'd like it. Go, Lawndale! Right, Daria? See you in class. <i>(leaves)</i>
<p>Daria <i>(frowning)</i> - Rah.
<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(Jake is still sitting in the bathroom)</i>
<p>Jake <i>(O.S.)</i> - Daria? Daria?! <i>Please</i> come home, Daria. Come on, I've read this article about the Olsen twins five times! I <i>knew</i> I should've made it 30 bucks. Damn it!
