<p><i>(opening theme song)</i>
<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(Daria and Tom are sitting on one of the living room sofas; Tom is reading <u>Critique of Pure Reason</u> by Immanuel Kant, while Daria is reading a macroeconomics textbook; both are obviously bored out of their minds)</i>
<p>Daria - God, this is dull. So much for my silly childhood dream of becoming a supply side economist. <i>(closes book)</i>
<p>Tom - At least you're not reading Kant. This guy gives dry, ponderous intellectuals a bad name. <i>(closes book)</i>
<p>Daria - Speaking of intellectuals...
<p><i>(Quinn enters the room)</i>
<p>Quinn - Augh! I just had the worst date of my life! Not only did he wear white pants, his car CD-player skipped...
<p><i>(Daria and Tom look at each other)</i>
<p>Quinn - ...and if that weren't bad enough, he spent the whole dinner talking about himself and then accused <i>me</i> of not paying attention just because I had to quickly check my lipstick in the butter knife...
<p><i>(Daria and Tom get up and start to leave)</i>
<p>Quinn - Wait! Where are you going?!
<p>Daria - To check our mascara in the salad tongs.
<p>Quinn - But you can't go! <i>(sits on the sofa)</i> I really need someone to talk to and all the normal people are out on dates.
<p>Daria - Oh, well, you wouldn't want to barge in on someone's date. <i>(she and Tom head upstairs)</i>
<p>Quinn - Exactly! <i>(grabs phone and dial)</i> Tiffany? I had the worst evening... fine, hurry up and order dessert...
<p><i>(at Tokyo Toby's Sushi Restaurant)</i>
<p><i>(Toby, Helen, and Jake are seated at a table; Helen and Jake have plates of sushi in front of them)</i>
<p>Jake - So you see, Toby, a top-notch marketing consultant could really beef up your business!
<p>Toby - Er, Jake, we're a sushi bar. Don't you mean "fish up" my business? <i>(laughs)</i>
<p><i>(Jake laughs)</i>
<p>Toby - Here, have some more sake. <i>(pours sake into Jake's cup)</i>
<p>Jake - Don't mind if I do.
<p>Helen - Jake, haven't you had...
<p>Toby - Hey, Ellen, why aren't you eating? Not trying to keep your girlish figure at your age, are you? <i>(laughs)</i>
<p><i>(Jake laughs)</i>
<p>Helen - Ha-ha... actually, I had a late lunch. <i>(quietly)</i> Followed by an insufferable dinner. <i>(deliberately drops a piece of sushi onto the napkin on her lap)</i>
<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(Daria and Tom are in her bedroom, lounging on the bed and studying; suddenly, loud music starts playing across the hall)</i>
<p>Tom - What is that?!
<p>Daria - Either a traveling band of eunuchs, or Quinn's figured out how to turn on the radio.
<p><i>(Daria gets up and shuts the bedroom door, then heads back to the bed)</i>
<p>Tom - God, Daria. Why didn't you tell me things were so bad at home?
<p>Daria - I didn't want you to worry.
<p><i>(time-shift; the clock goes from 10:39 P.M. to 4:07 A.M.; Daria and Tom have fallen asleep)</i>
<p><i>(Tom wakes up and glances bleary-eyed at the clock)</i>
<p>Tom - Oops.
<p><i>(Tom shakes Daria's leg to wake her; Daria glances at the clock, which wakes her up immediately)</i>
<p>Daria - Oh, God. We've got to get you the hell out of here.
<p>Tom - <i>(quietly)</i> Works for me.
<p><i>(Daria and Tom get up; both wince as Daria opens the bedroom door, which squeaks)</i>
<p>Tom - <i>(quietly)</i> I'll go myself -- it'll be quieter.
<p><i>(Daria nods, then opens the door wider to let Tom out; they wince as the door squeaks again)</i>
<p><i>(Tom quietly creeps down the darkened stairway, unaware that a half-drunk Jake has woken up and is rummaging around the kitchen for a snack)</i>
<p>Jake - I'm starving... sushi sucks! Sake rocks. Hey, got to remember that. <i>(burps, then starts rummaging in the refrigerator)</i> Where's the lazooni...?
<p><i>(a plate of lasagna in hand, Jake walks out of the kitchen and finds Tom trying to open the front door, which is stuck)</i>
<p>Jake - Hey!
<p><i>(Tom whirls around in shock)</i>
<p>Tom - Mr. Morgendorffer! I can explain!
<p>Jake - Tom! Oh, hey, you know, that door sticks on me, too. Let me get it for you.
<p><i>(Jake hands his plate to a wide-eyed Tom and opens the door)</i>
<p>Jake - Hey, you ever try any of that sake? It sucks! I mean rocks!
<p>Tom - Um, no. You know, the age thing. <i>(hands plate back to Jake and makes a hasty exit, not willing to push his good luck)</i>
<p>Jake - Oh, yeah. Good for you! <i>(closes door)</i> Nice guy, that Tom.
<p><i>(Jake heads back upstairs and climbs into bed; Helen is barely awake)</i>
<p>Helen - <i>(sleepily)</i> No wonder you can't sleep. Tokyo Toby's is poison.
<p>Jake - Is not... hey, I forgot to offer Tom some lazonny...
<p><i>(in Daria's bedroom)</i>
<p>Helen <i>(offscreen)</i> - What?!
<p><i>(Daria, who was trying to sleep, suddenly opens her eyes and sits up in bed)</i>
<p>Daria - Damn. One one thousand, two one thousand, three...
<p><i>(Helen bursts into the room)</i>
<p>Helen - Daria, I need to talk to you, right now!
<p>Daria - ...one thousand.
<p><i>(it's now morning; Helen is still grilling Daria like she's on the witness stand)</i>
<p>Helen - All right, Daria. I guess I can believe your story, though it seems pretty farfetched to me that two teenagers with raging hormones...
<p>Daria - My hormones don't rage. Oh, sure, they get mad sometimes, but then they just stop speaking to each other.
<p>Helen - All right... so you weren't, you know...?
<p>Daria - I certainly do know. And no.
<p><i>(out in the hall, Quinn -- who is <i>still</i> not a morning person -- approaches Daria's bedroom)</i>
<p>Helen - Then tell me once again why Tom was slipping out the door at 4:00 A.M. like a common criminal?
<p><i>(at that, Quinn's eyes fly wide open and her jaw drops to the floor; it takes her several seconds to recover)</i>
<p>Quinn - Phone! <i>(reverses course and heads back to her bedroom)</i>
<p>Daria - Gee, could the sneaking around have been part of a futile attempt to avoid an unnecessary all-night lecture about responsibility?
<p>Helen - All right, I admit I was a little upset, but I'm sure you can understand that when a mother sees her daughter, her little baby girl, to whom she gave life...
<p>Daria - Nothing happened. I'd tell you if it did.
<p>Helen - You would? Really?
<p>Daria - Um... anyway, you believe me, right?
<p><i>(in her bedroom, Quinn is on the phone)</i>
<p>Quinn - <i>(quietly)</i> Stacy. Stacy! <i>(loudly)</i> I can't talk any louder, you dope! I'm trying to tell you my sister had a guy in her room all night!
<p><i>(Stacy starts crying over the phone)</i>
<p><i>(in Daria's bedroom)</i>
<p>Helen - Seriously, Daria, if the time comes when you decide that... you know... I hope you <i>will</i> come to me first.
<p>Daria - Um, what?
<p>Helen - Not that I would ever try to talk you out of it -- which is not to say I'm trying to talk you <i>into</i> it -- it's just that I'd like to have the chance to discuss things with you first. I only wish I could have gone to my mother before I made such an awful mistake. What is it about stunt drivers that makes otherwise level-headed teenage girls just whip off their...
<p>Daria - <i>(quickly interrupts)</i> Okay, okay. Um, I've got to study. Big test. Biiig test...
<p><i>(Jake barges into the room)</i>
<p>Jake - Helen! I think I've got something in my throat! Can you see anything down there? <i>(makes "aaah" sound, then sees Daria)</i> Daria! I, uh...
<p><i>(Jake turns tail and runs -- "I can't deal with this" -- with Helen on his heels)</i>
<p>Helen - Jake, nothing happened!
<p><i>(Daria closes her door, then sighs)</i>
<p><i>(at Pizza King)</i>
<p><i>(Tom and Daria are sitting in a booth; each has a slice of pizza and a soda)</i>
<p>Daria - The problem with going to restaurants is that they're not in my room.
<p>Tom - I know what you mean. I have the same issue with hiking trails.
<p><i>(Upchuck walks halfway past the table, stops, gets an "Upchuck look" on his face and turns back)</i>
<p>Upchuck - My, my, my... is that the lovely Miss Morgendorffer?
<p>Daria - Congratulations. You've passed your vision test. Please proceed to line B for your written.
<p>Upchuck - And you've passed your admission test to Club De Amore. Please check your inhibitions at the door! <i>(growls and leaves)</i>
<p>Tom - What's wrong with him?
<p>Daria - His parents forgot to put decals on the sliding glass doors.
<p><i>(Kevin and Brittany approach the table; both have a slice of pizza in hand, and both are taking an inordinate amount of interest in Tom and Daria)</i>
<p>Kevin - Hey, Daria's guy! Way to go, man!
<p>Tom - Excuse me?
<p>Kevin - You know... you did the wild walk, made a touchdown, signed the deed!
<p>Daria - Tonight's <i>Babble Chat</i> was hosted by Kevin Thompson.
<p>Brittany - Oh, Daria! Now we can have womanly talks!
<p>Daria - What the hell are <i>you</i> ranting about?
<p>Brittany - You know... <i>(nods her head towards Kevin)</i>
<p>Kevin - Let's go, babe, and leave the love babes alone. <i>(he and Brittany leave)</i>
<p>Tom - That was weird. Even for them.
<p>Daria - We'd better get out of here before the parmesan fumes get to us, too.
<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(Jake and Helen are in the living room; Helen is sitting and trying to work, while Jake is looking at his throat in a hand mirror)</i>
<p>Jake - Damn it, Helen, I <i>know</i> there's something crawling up my throat, and I think it's a parasite courtesy of Tokyo Toby's Parasite Restaurant! If I stand still, I can even feel it laughing inside of me...
<p>Helen - Now you're being ridiculous. Even if that horrible sushi did have a parasite, it couldn't have survived that much sake.
<p><i>(Daria enters the room, and Jake immediately gets tongue-tied again)</i>
<p>Jake - Daria... I... um... uh...
<p><i>(Jake starts to leave, but Helen grabs him by the arm and pulls him back)</i>
<p>Helen - Your father thinks he picked up a parasite eating sushi.
<p>Daria - You mean the kind that drill through your intestines, twisting and turning and driving you slowly insane until they grow eight feet long and corkscrew out through your vital organs?
<p><i>(her little revenge pays off: Jake starts freaking out, little by little, then collapses on the couch)</i>
<p>Helen - Daria...
<p>Jake - Help me, Helen... before the madness sets in.
<p>Daria - Any further.
<p>Helen - Daria!
<p><i>(phone rings as Daria heads upstairs to her room; Jake answers with the cordless)</i>
<p>Jake - Hello? Oh, Toby. Listen, about your so-called fresh sushi... I got the job? How much? Wow! I mean, I think I can live with that. See you tomorrow! <i>(hangs up)</i> Helen! I got the job!
<p>Helen - And all the parasites you can eat.
<p>Jake - Parasites? You know, you were right. It's probably just a sore throat... I think I'm gonna throw up...
<p><i>(Jake clutches his throat and hurries out of the room, while Helen just rolls her eyes)</i>
<p><i>(at the Lane house)</i>
<p><i>(Jane is sitting on her bed, sketching, when the phone rings; she answers, and the screen splits between her and Daria)</i>
<p>Daria - Hey.
<p>Jane - Ah. I've been expecting your call
<p>Daria - Huh?
<p>Jane - All right, I'm listening. But for God's sake, at least spare me the squishier details and the rapturous declarations of undying love.
<p>Daria - What are you talking about?
<p>Jane - What are <i>you?</i>
<p>Daria - I was hoping <i>you</i> could tell <i>me.</i> Tom and I ran into some people from school and they kept alluding to I'm-almost-afraid-to-guess-what. Is something going on?
<p>Jane - Come on, Daria, you know.
<p>Daria - Know what?
<p><i>(pause)</i>
<p>Jane - You <i>don't</i> know?
<p>Daria - What?! Just tell me!
<p>Jane - Well, there's this rumor going around that you and Tom... slept together.
<p>Daria - Huh?!
<p>Jane - And that your father walked in right... well, right in the middle of things.
<p>Daria - Oh, my God.
<p>Jane - And Daria... <i>(chuckles)</i> ...since when do you own a pair of black high heels?
<p><i>(Daria lowers the phone, wide-eyed with shock)</i>
<p><hr>
<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(Quinn is in her bedroom, preening in front of the mirror; she puts her hair over one shoulder, then the other)</i>
<p>Quinn - That's not right, either. Oh, the curse of having two good shoulders!
<p><i>(a <i>very</i> unhappy Daria walks into the room)</i>
<p>Quinn - Daria! What are you doing in here?
<p>Daria - I want to know exactly what you told everyone at school about me and Tom.
<p>Quinn - I didn't say a word! Besides, I swore Stacy to secrecy, but then she told Sandi and Tiffany, so if you're mad at anyone, it should be Stacy and not me!
<p>Daria - Uh-huh. Look, dammit, nothing hap--
<p>Quinn - Stop! I don't want to hear any of the sordid details. I don't care what coupled people do!
<p>Daria - And I'm telling you, nothing--
<p>Quinn - Okay! Okay! Look, I got to, um... go shopping. Big sale. Biiig sale. <i>(starts to walk away)</i>
<p>Daria - Quinn, listen to me for one min--
<p>Quinn <i>(offscreen)</i> - Half off. Gotta go. Bye!
<p><i>(Daria rolls her eyes in exasperation)</i>
<p><i>(at school)</i>
<p><i>(Daria approaches Jodie, who is standing at her locker)</i>
<p>Daria - Can I talk to you for a second?
<p>Jodie - Sure. What's up?
<p>Daria - Um, you've probably heard the rumor about me and Tom...
<p>Jodie - Hey, it's no big deal, right? This isn't the '50s, when women had to worry about their reputations.
<p>Daria - But it's not true. I never slept with Tom and I don't own any high heels. I don't even own any low heels.
<p>Jodie - Daria, it's okay, really. Besides, you and Tom have been going out for so long, I'd think by now you'd <i>want</i> to do more than just hold hands. Right?
<p>Daria - Um...
<p>Jodie - Hey, sex is nothing to be ashamed of, as long as you're responsible.
<p>Daria - So, then, you and Mack have... been responsible?
<p>Jodie - Um... I really don't want to discuss that right now.
<p>Daria - I understand.
<p>Jodie - I promise: soon as my parents are dead, I'll tell you all about it. <i>(walks away)</i>
<p>Daria - Okay. Just so long as there's nothing to be ashamed of.
<p><i>(in downtown Lawndale)</i>
<p><i>(Daria and Jane are walking to Pizza King)</i>
<p>Daria - And I thought the whole point of being unpopular was that no one knows you exist or talks about you.
<p>Jane - It's been a slow news week. Don't worry, they'll go back to not recognizing you soon enough.
<p>Daria - Easy for you to say. <i>You</i> never had a rumor circulating around school that you slept with someone.
<p>Jane - Well, if that ever does happen, I hope the guy's a professional wrestler. Look, why does this bother you so much, anyway? It can't be you're worried Kevin won't respect you.
<p>Daria - No... I guess it's the assumption that if you're in a relationship, you're having sex. So if you're not, does that make your relationship any less of one?
<p>Jane - I <i>knew</i> I should have jumped Tom when I had the chance. <i>(Daria gives her a cross look)</i> Kidding! I told you, I'm waiting till college. 11:00 A.M. on move-in day.
<p>Daria - At least you've got a plan.
<p>Jane - Anyway, being in a relationship can't possibly hinge on physical intimacy 'cause that would mean our parents are still doing it.
<p>Daria - Which is absurd.
<p>Jane - No chance.
<p>Daria - I'd join the circus.
<p>Jane - Right behind you.
<p>Daria - Thanks for your insight.
<p>Jane - What I'm here for.
<p><i>(both girls enter Pizza King and sit down with a couple of slices and sodas)</i>
<p>Daria - You really think once some new rumor comes along everyone will forget about me and Tom?
<p>Jane - I'm sure of it.
<p><i>(Daria sees Kevin and Brittany walking by)</i>
<p>Daria - Good... <i>(louder)</i> ...because my sister's got a rare form of Malaysian toenail fungus.
<p>Jane - <i>(louder)</i> Ooh! That can be terminal!
<p><i>(Kevin and Brittany look at each other, open-mouthed in shock at this news)</i>
<p><i>(at the office of Doctor E.L. Hask)</i>
<p><i>(Jake is in an examining chair; the doctor is about to yank something out of Jake's throat)</i>
<p>Doctor - Whoa. That is one hell of a parasite. Now hold on! One, two, three! <i>(lunges)</i>
<p>Jake - Aah!
<p>Doctor - Here. Look.
<p><i>(the doctor holds up something on the end of his probe: it's a <i>really</i> nasty-looking parasite)</i>
<p>Jake - Eww... um, must have gotten it from that damn food-rotting Tupperware...
<p>Doctor - Tupperware? I don't think so. When was the last time you had sushi?
<p>Jake - Last weekend at Tokyo Toby's...
<p>Doctor - Tokyo Toby's? When is the health department going to shut that worm factory down? This is the third anisakid I've seen come out of that place in two months!
<p>Jake - Oh...
<p><i>(at the Sloane house)</i>
<p><i>(Daria and Tom are on the couch watching TV)</i>
<p>SSW Announcer - Can anger management training really help gorillas avoid extinction? Maybe, but it's not doing much for the psychiatrists! "The apes of wrath," today on <i>Sick, Sad World!</i>
<p><i>(Tom mutes the TV with the remote control)</i>
<p>Tom - Are you okay? You hardly said a word when the monster attacked the girls' swim team. All those vital organs bobbing around in the water...
<p>Daria - <i>(sighs)</i> I know I shouldn't let it bother me, but there's this rumor going around school that you and I slept together.
<p>Tom - Really? Can we get that rumor started at my school?
<p>Daria - It's not funny.
<p>Tom - Come on, Daria. Since when do you care what other people think?
<p>Daria - It's not that... so much. It's just that... the implication is, well, to be <i>really</i> close, couples need physical as well as emotional intimacy.
<p>Tom - Boy, people will believe anything. Look, you said you weren't ready. So okay.
<p>Daria - Oh, fine. Just take me at my word.
<p>Tom - That <i>is</i> what you said, right? I mean, correct me if I'm wrong. Please.
<p>Daria - Hey, far be it from <i>me</i> to pressure you into anything.
<p>Tom - Daria, <i>you're</i> the one who doesn't want to, remember? I backed off 'cause I thought that's what you wanted. But I can be persuaded otherwise. See? All done.
<p>Daria - Okay, fine... in the interest of moving our relationship forward and taking it to a new, deeper level, I've decided I'm ready, too. Damn it.
<p>Tom - Really? Are you sure?
<p>Daria - Sure I'm sure. Of course, there's the issue of... you know.
<p>Tom - No problem! I've got one right here. <i>(pulls out his wallet)</i> You know, my parents won't be home...
<p>Daria - Wait! You just carry one of those things around?
<p>Tom - Wishful thinking?
<p>Daria - God, guys <i>are</i> all the same.
<p>Tom - What, responsible?
<p>Daria - You know, maybe we <i>are</i> rushing into this. Forget I brought it up.
<p>Tom - Forget you brought it up? Jeez!
<p>Daria - Hey. I didn't expect to be put on the spot.
<p>Tom - I thought you just said you wanted to.
<p>Daria - Not so much that I'm running around town with a neon birth control device in my purse.
<p>Tom - Look, I've been a good guy about this. You said you're ready, so I tried to be conscientious and now you don't want to again. Make up your mind! And it's not neon!
<p><i>(pause)</i>
<p>Daria - I'm ready.
<p>Tom - You're sure?
<p>Daria - Positive.
<p><i>(pause)</i>
<p>Tom - Um, okay. When were you thinking, um, we would, you know?
<p>Daria - Um, anytime. But not right now.
<p>Tom - Um, okay.
<p><i>(pause)</i>
<p>Daria - It's definitely not neon, right?
<p><hr>
<p><i>(at Tom's house)</i>
<p><i>(Daria and Tom are right where we left off)</i>
<p>Daria - So, um... should we pick a date?
<p>Tom - Well... my parents are going out of town next weekend. How about then?
<p>Daria - No fair. Home court advantage.
<p>Tom - Fine. Your place.
<p>Daria - Like I'd ever find all the microphones Mom's hidden around my room.
<p>Tom - The Rendezvous Motel? You know, on Route 6.
<p>Daria - Gee, don't make me feel <i>too</i> special.
<p>Tom - All right, the boathouse at the lake, with the stars, the moon, the water?
<p>Daria - And the mosquitoes, the splinters, the security patrol?
<p>Tom - <i>(frowning slightly)</i> Okay, how about Mars, then? Soon as that whole colonization thing gets going?
<p><i>(pause)</i>
<p>Daria - Your room, next Saturday night at eight.
<p><i>(at school)</i>
<p><i>(Jane approaches Daria, who's closing her locker)</i>
<p>Jane - Yo, kinky shoe girl, good news. The Malaysian fungus has your sister down to three toes, and one of them is dangling.
<p>Daria - That's so sad.
<p><i>(they start walking to class)</i>
<p>Jane - Yeah, and that hot news flash from the Lawndale gossip mill has left you and Tom in the proverbial dust. No one cares about your sex life anymore, or lack thereof.
<p>Daria - Um... make that former lack thereof.
<p>Jane - Daria!
<p><i>(they stop)</i>
<p>Daria - Or rather, future former lack thereof.
<p>Jane - Oh. So... when?
<p>Daria - Soon. This weekend.
<p>Jane - Ah. You seem a tad... what's the word... scared witless?
<p><i>(they resume walking)</i>
<p>Daria - Okay, so I am a little very nervous.
<p>Jane - Of course you are! This is a big decision. A defining moment in your life!
<p>Daria - Oh, good -- <i>that's</i> not too much pressure.
<p>Jane - Or possibly just another adolescent embarrassment you'll need to repress in adulthood just to get out of bed in the morning.
<p>Daria - Huh. So far, that makes everything after my 12th birthday. <i>(pause)</i> Um, you don't think that'll really happen, do you?
<p>Jane - No, no, it's gonna be great. Well, then, congratulations or whatever they say in situations like these.
<p>Daria - I think it's "S.O.S."
<p><i>(Daria walks into the classroom, leaving a concerned Jane standing outside the door)</i>
<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(Jake and Helen are in the kitchen; Helen is making dinner)</i>
<p>Jake - <i>You</i> said I was being ridiculous! <i>You</i> said it couldn't be a parasite!
<p>Helen - Okay, Jake. You were right, I was wrong.
<p>Jake - Oh, sweet music to my ears!
<p>Helen - Which only proves that I was right about Tokyo Toby's being poison in the first place.
<p>Jake - Oh, yeah...
<p><i>(Daria walks into the kitchen)</i>
<p>Jake - Um... Daria! <i>(Jake beats a hasty retreat)</i>
<p>Helen - Daria, hi! Anything new?
<p>Daria - Well, you didn't hear it from me, but Quinn's played her last game of "This Little Piggy."
<p>Helen - Hmm, it's Friday night. Aren't you going out with Tom?
<p><i>(Daria pulls out a box of cookies and grabs one)</i>
<p>Daria - Sorry. Only one question per customer. Please try again tomorrow.
<p>Helen - Daria, about that talk we were going to have... we don't have to wait. We could have it...
<p>Daria - No, no. The end of time is fine for me. And speaking of the time...
<p>Jake - Okay! Even if you were right about Toby's, I was right about the parasite, and it was a double-wide parasite so that makes me doubly right!
<p>Helen - Jake, not now! I'm talking to Daria. Daria?
<p><i>(unseen by them, Daria has slipped out of the kitchen)</i>
<p><i>(in the morning, Daria slowly wakes up and realizes what day it is)</i>
<p>Daria - God. Saturday already?
<p><i>(at the Sloane house)</i>
<p><i>(it's 6:30 P.M.; Tom is whistling as he sets up his bedroom with candles and soft music; he obviously wants things to be special for his and Daria's first time)</i>
<p><i>(flash-forward to 9:00 P.M.; the candles are half gone, and Tom is getting frustrated; shaking his head, he picks up the phone and dials)</i>
<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(Helen is in the kitchen, rummaging around in the refrigerator)</i>
<p>Helen - When is Quinn going to stop storing her nail polish in the... ooh, "Sunrise Sublime."
<p><i>(the phone rings; Helen answers just as Daria enters the kitchen)</i>
<p>Helen - Hello? Oh, hi, Tom!
<p><i>(Daria frantically waves her arms "No!")</i>
<p>Helen - Daria? No, I haven't seen her. Sure, I'll tell her. Bye. <i>(hangs up)</i> Daria, is everything all right?
<p>Daria - Sure. Fine. Never been better. <i>(grabs something out of the refrigerator)</i>
<p>Helen - You know, I've never known you not to want to speak to Tom, or wear "Slicky Fingers" nail polish.
<p><i>(Daria looks down; she's grabbed a bottle of Quinn's nail polish)</i>
<p>Daria - Um... I believe you should try everything once no matter how unmistakably stupid it is. Almost everything. Anyway, got to go. Lot of homework. Big essay due. Biiig essay. <i>(leaves quickly)</i>
<p>Helen - I thought you said you were seeing Tom tonight. <i>(pause)</i> Daria?
<p><i>(at the Sloane house)</i>
<p><i>(Tom blows out an almost-gone candle, then tosses the bouquet of roses into the trash)</i>
<p>Tom - I don't believe this.
<p><i>(in the morning, Tom opens the front door to get the paper; a note is attached to it)</i>
<p>Tom - Daria.
<p><i>(Tom sits down on the living room couch and begins to read)</i>
<p>Daria <i>(voiceover)</i> - "Dear Tom: I'm sorry about last night, but when I thought about it for the 50th time, I realized I'm just not ready. Please let this letter serve as my acceptance of the inevitable breakup. Daria."
<p>Tom - Damn.
<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(Tom knocks on the front door; Daria answers)</i>
<p>Daria - Oh. Um, you got my note?
<p><i>(at the park)</i>
<p><i>(Tom and Daria walk towards, and sit down on, a bench)</i>
<p>Tom - Daria, how could you do this to me?
<p>Daria - I can't help it if I'm not ready. I can't change the way I feel.
<p>Tom - Not that. I mean, how could you dump me without even talking it over?
<p>Daria - Look, we both agreed that sleeping together would bring us closer, so... not doing it must be driving us apart.
<p>Tom - No, <i>you</i> said it would bring us closer and I said, fine, if that's the way you feel. I wasn't pushing this, <i>you</i> were, remember? I was perfectly happy with our relationship just the way it was.
<p>Daria - Perfectly happy?
<p>Tom - Okay, very content. The point is, you're not ready. I understand.
<p><i>(pause)</i>
<p>Daria - No, you <i>don't</i> understand. It's not that I'm not ready. It's that I'm scared.
<p>Tom - Same thing.
<p>Daria - No, it's <i>not</i> the same thing. I just admitted that I'm scared. The thought of that much intimacy... it's just overwhelming to me.
<p>Tom - Oh. <i>(pause)</i> Daria, you know I would never do anything to make you uncomfortable.
<p>Daria - And even if I could handle it, what if <i>you</i> were disappointed? Our whole relationship could be ruined.
<p>Tom - You don't want to have sex because you're afraid it'll hurt our relationship, and then you break up with me. Doctor, my head.
<p>Daria - I thought that's what you'd want.
<p>Tom - Think again.
<p><i>(he kisses her)</i>
<p>Tom - You know, I think that, despite ourselves, we just reached a new level of intimacy.
<p>Daria - And lived to tell about it.
<p><i>(at the Morgendorffer house)</i>
<p><i>(Daria is sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper; Jake is on the phone, pacing as he talks)</i>
<p>Jake - Hmm, free air fresheners with the fragrance of tuna? Let me think about that... and, hey, Toby, speaking of thinking... now, you know I think your sushi's delicious...
<p>Daria - Especially that rice and roundworm filling.
<p>Jake - ...but you might want to change suppliers. See, I got a parasite from it... no, it wasn't a little parasite, it was a big, mean parasite.... well, I'm fine now... I am <i>not</i> whining. Hey, it's not my fault I missed the draft. The war was winding down! Oh, yeah?! Listen, you big fat blowfish... <i>(hangs up)</i>
<p>Daria - Can I have a raise?
<p>Jake - Dammit, Daria, do you believe the nerve of that guy and his rotten fish?
<p>Daria - If that rotten fish has restored communication between us, Father, then I say hooray for smelly old rot.
<p>Jake - Oh. Oh!
<p><i>(Helen walks into the room)</i>
<p>Helen - Jake, is everything all right?
<p>Jake - Yeah! I mean no! I mean... huh. I think I feel something else in there. I bet that parasite laid a whole extended family of eggs! Where's that mirror?
<p><i>(Jake quickly leaves to find a mirror; Helen sits down next to Daria as Quinn enter the room)</i>
<p>Helen - Daria...
<p>Quinn - Does anyone know how I got on the mailing list for Tootsie Tech, "World's Largest Supplier of Prosthetic Toes By Mail"?
<p>Daria - Ooh, do they have those vintage wooden ones?
<p>Quinn - Augh! <i>(leaves)</i>
<p>Helen - Um, Daria...
<p>Daria - Tom and I didn't have sex, and we're not going to any time soon. Unless, of course, a bomb goes off and, as Earth's last two survivors, we must replenish the human race. Although, frankly, that's not motivation enough for me.
<p><i>(Helen sighs in relief)</i>
<p>Helen - Well, I can't say I'm not somewhat relieved. I just want you to know that whatever decisions you make in life, I'm on your side and...
<p><i>(Daria lifts the newspaper high to hide from Helen)</i>
<p>Daria - So instead, we've decided to sublimate our urges by traveling cross-country with a motorcycle gang.
<p>Helen - All right. You just remember to call home on Sunday nights.
<p>Daria - <i>(lowers paper)</i> Hey!
<p>Helen - Ha!
<p>Jake <i>(offscreen)</i> - Damn it! I think I can see their beady little eyes! God help me!
