<p><i>(opening theme song)</i>
<p><b><i>SCENE 1 - PIZZA PLACE</i></b>
<p>Jane - I must say I'm honored you've chosen to spend your valuable Saturday night with me. What happened? Tom's parents send him off for more forty-watt bulbs?
<p>Daria - I was just craving a bit of sisterhood, so long as it doesn't involve my actual sister. What'd you do today?
<p>Jane - I actually accomplished something... I mean, other than getting up. I applied to Lawndale State and State University.
<p>Daria - Really? Why? I thought you wanted to go to Boston Fine Arts College?
<p>Jane - I do want to go to BFAC, but unlike Lawndale State and State U, you have to have talent to get in. So they give you extra time to put together a killer art portfolio.
<p>Daria - How's that going?
<p>Jane - Why, it's going so well that when you called to go out, I only cried tears of relief for ten minutes. What about you? Still thinking about... <i>(snooty accent)</i> ...Bromwell?
<p>Daria - They don't really talk like that there... I hope. Anyway, I'm applying because it's an outstanding university, not because the students engage in the rectal transport of steel rods.
<p>Jane - The Equestrian Club must be in constant pain.
<p><font color="red"><b>Daria - I probably won't get in, anyway. They're big on wide-ranging extracurriculars.
<p>Jane - Damn well-rounded crap.</b></font> What about your safeties?
<p>Daria - I've applied to Raft, Ellis, Lloyd...
<p>Jane - Raft's your safety? Gutsy, Morgendorffer.
<p>Daria - No, no, no. Raft's my second choice. My parents won't think I've sent out enough applications if I only get rejected from one place.
<p>Jane - Hey, Raft's in Boston, right? Wouldn't it be great if we went to college in the same town? We could meet on the weekends to eat pizza and complain.
<p>Daria - Well, they say college is all about broadening your horizons.
<p><hr>
<p><b><i>SCENE 2 - MORGENDORFFER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM</i></b>
<p><i>(Jake and Helen are seated on the sofas; Jake goes through the mail, while Helen is reading a legal brief)</i>
<p>Jake - <i>(holding a bill)</i> Gaaaah! Six hundred dollars for shoes? That you walk in? On the ground?
<p>Helen - Relax, Jake. I'll take care of it. <i>(stands up)</i> Quinn! I want you to come downstairs and explain yourself!
<p>Daria - <i>(entering by the front door)</i> Finally, the mystery will be solved.
<p>Quinn - <i>(coming from the kitchen, speaking on phone)</i> Sandi, <font color="red"><b>I know you're not color blind</b></font>, I'm just saying tangerine isn't as orange as... <i>(sees look on Helen's face)</i> ...call you back. <i>(hangs up)</i> Sorry, Fashion Club crisis.
<p>Helen - Never mind. What's this six hundred dollar charge at Cashman's?
<p>Quinn - But Mom, I actually saved money by buying faux alligator instead of real alligator<font color="red"><b>, and I helped save the animals, too</b></font>.
<p><font color="red"><b>Daria - Oh, yeah. You got a thank-you note from the International Brotherhood of Alligator Wrestlers.</b></font>
<p>Helen - Well, you can also save your excuses. The shoes are going back.
<p>Quinn - But I can't return them. Final markdown. However, if it makes you feel better, I promise never to buy on sale again.
<p>Helen - You're not buying anything, period, until you pay off this bill.
<p>Quinn - I understand. I shall require a substantial increase in my allowance.
<p>Jake and Helen - No!
<p>Quinn - But you know I don't have any money. It's why I have to buy on credit. Let's work together, Mother, and attack the problem at its source.
<p>Helen - Good idea. You'll have to go out and get a job.
<p>Quinn - Uh! <i>(coughs)</i> Water. <i>(runs to the kitchen)</i>
<p>Daria - Hope she doesn't get any on the shoes.
<p>Jake - Gah!
<p>Helen - Sit down, Jake. She's not wearing them. <i>(to Daria)</i> Shouldn't you be working on your college applications?
<p>Jake - Hey, yeah! You know, Daria, I'd be happy to give your application to Middleton a quick going over. I think I know a thing or two about what they like at the old alma mater.
<p>Daria - Ummm, gee, thanks. Yes... I... uh, you're right. I should be working on my applications. Right now. <i>(gets up from the sofa, and goes upstairs)</i>
<p>Helen - You know, Jake, just because we went to Middleton doesn't mean Daria will. She's applying to a lot of different places.
<p>Jake - Oh, sure. But why would she want to go to just any old college when she could follow in our footsteps? Middleton's a Morgendorffer tradition.
<p>Helen - So's military school.
<p>Jake - Bite your tongue, Helen. No daughter of mine is ever going to share a latrine with fifty hateful boys who can sniff out weakness like day-old cheese.
<p>Helen - Let's hope not, dear.
<p><hr>
<p><b><i>SCENE 3 - SLOANE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM</i></b>
<font color="red"><b><p><i>(Daria and Tom seated on sofa with video game controllers; Tom is animated, Daria is calmly sitting upright working controls)</i>
<p>Tom - Say your prayers, you marrow-sucking creatures from beyond death! <i>(sound of explosion from TV)</i> Yeah! <i>(he turns to Daria)</i> How come you didn't send out the zombie sweeper? Are you sure you're trying?
<p>Daria - I don't know. Pulverizing Beelzebub's flesh-eating lackeys just isn't as much fun as it used to be.
<p><i>(they set controllers down and Daria picks up the TV remote)</i>
<p>Tom - Maybe there's something more uplifting on TV. You know, like maybe a movie about pulverizing Beelzebub's flesh-eating lackeys.</b></font>
<p><i>(television screen of geeky guy at computer, typing; after a couple of seconds, flame erupts from monitor and engulfs him, leaving only a skeleton)</i>
<p>SSW Announcer - Everyone hates the message board miscreant, but now you can do something about it! Flame wars: the next generation, tonight on <i>Sick, Sad World</i>!
<p>Daria - <font color="red"><b>Finally, news you can use.</b></font> Finish your college applications yet?
<p>Tom - All except Bromwell's. Mom and Dad want to want to review the alumni section to make sure I didn't leave anyone out.
<p>Daria - That shouldn't take more than a week or two.
<font color="red"><b><p>Tom - So a few people in my family have gone to the school. That sort of thing doesn't count like it used to. Now, you actually have to know stuff to get in.
<p>Daria - Or donate a building.
<p>Tom - That was my uncle, and it was only a wing.
<p>Daria - Yeah, they probably didn't even notice.</b></font>
<p>Tom - Did you ask about going up to Newtown to visit Bromwell with me?
<p>Daria - It's cool with my mother as long as your mother's definitely chaperoning and we can drive up to Boston afterwards to check out a couple of other colleges.
<p>Tom - That's the plan. Boston's where all my safeties are.
<p>Daria - Umm, mine, too.
<p>Tom - Hey, don't worry, Daria. You'll get into Bromwell with your incredible test scores and grades. I'll get in the old fashioned way: bribery and nepotism.
<p>Daria - Gee, when you put it that way, it all sounds so fair and just.
<p><hr>
<p><b><i>SCENE 4 - GOVERNOR'S PARK RESTAURANT</i></b>
<p><i>(the Fashion Club members are seated around a table)</i>
<p>Stacy - Guys, it is so nice of you to take me out on my birthday.
<p>Sandi - Our pleasure, Stacy. <font color="red"><b>We would never leave you alone on your birthday without a date.
<p>Tiffany - Brr.</b></font>
<p>Sandi - Just because the rest of us had dates on our birthdays...
<p>Stacy - Oh, yes, Sandi. You mentioned that. Boy, I can't believe I'm another year older. Time goes by so fast.
<p>Quinn - I know. Just yesterday I was playing with makeup starter kits, and today I'm being forced out in the working world. And I thought these were supposed to be the carefree years.
<p>Stacy - I know, Quinn. Why don't you get a job here? There are lots of cute guys, and the hostesses get to dress up and wear hoopy earrings.
<p>Sandi - Stacy! Are you suggesting that a Fashion Club member serve the public?
<p>Tiffany - Stacy, tsk.
<p><i>(Stacy whimpers)</i>
<p>Quinn - Uh, geez, Sandi, it's not that bad an idea. This place is sort of fun, and it wouldn't be like the kind of job where you'd endanger your nails or anything.
<p>Tiffany - Mmmm... good point.
<p>Sandi - Fine, if you want to sully the fine name...
<p><i>(a waitress approaches, bearing a cake with a lit candle on top, and places it in front of Stacy)</i>
<p>Tiffany - Surprise...
<p>Quinn - Make a wish, Stacy!
<p><i>(Stacy is about to blow the candle)</i>
<p>Sandi - And don't worry. I'm sure that chocolate won't cause your sensitive skin to break out.
<p><i>(Stacy blows the candle out)</i>
<p>Quinn and Tiffany <i>(clapping)</i> - Yay!
<p>Stacy - Thanks, guys.
<p>Sandi - What'd you wish for?
<p>Stacy - Ummm; nothing.
<p>Sandi - Come on, Stacy. Tell us! Don't be your usual drippy self.
<p>Stacy - Nothing. Anyway, it didn't come true.
<p><hr>
<p><b><i>SCENE 5 - LAWNDALE HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA</i></b>
<p><i>(Jodie and Mack are having lunch)</i>
<p>Jodie - How did your father's meeting at the bank go?
<p>Mack - Not good. My Dad says I can't go to Vance unless they give me a scholarship. We can only afford State University, and they don't even have a business school.
<p>Jodie - Oh, Mack. You've worked so hard. You've just got to get that scholarship.
<p><font color="red"><b>Mack - Would you mind calling the committee and telling them that?
<p>Jodie - I'll even tell them how cute you look when you study.</b></font>
<p>Mack - What about you? How are your applications going?
<p>Jodie - Well, I got the big ones in today. Turner and Crestmore.
<p>Mack - Crestmore... the dream of dreams.
<p>Jodie - Hmmm.
<p>Mack - What's wrong?
<p>Jodie - It's a top school and everything, but I'd really rather go to Turner.
<p>Mack - Your father's alma mater? He must love that.
<p>Jodie - He doesn't know I applied.
<p>Mack - Why?
<p>Jodie - Because he wouldn't let me go anyway. He says not even a great African-American college like Turner can beat the Crestmore name on a resume. <font color="red"><b>To say nothing of the bragging rights it'll give him on the golf course.</b></font>
<p>Mack - Oh, man. That sucks.
<p>Jodie - You know, my grandmother was in the first Turner graduating class to admit women. I'd be carrying on a tradition. Plus, I'd finally get a break from having to be the perfect Jodie doll at a mostly-white school.
<p>Mack - I hear that.
<p>Jodie - I wish my father did. I can always transfer to Crestmore after a year or two. At least, I'd find what Turner's like. But his mind's made up.
<p>Mack - Well, Crestmore hasn't accepted you yet.
<p>Jodie - Hey, maybe we should both go to State University. Then we wouldn't have to worry about how to get together on weekends.
<p><i>(Brittany and Kevin enter)</i>
<p>Brittany - Hi, Jodie. Hi, Mack. You know, I applied to State University, too. They've one of the best cheerleading squads in the country.
<p>Mack - God help me!
<p>Jodie - Ummm, that's nice, Brittany. Kevin, do you know where you're going?
<p>Kevin - It's a secret, man.
<p>Mack - Why? Is the school embarrassed?
<p>Kevin - Why would it be embarrassed? I'm a QB. It's not like I'm a brain or anything.
<p>Mack - Truer words were never spoken.
<p>Kevin - Thanks, man!
<p><hr>
<p><b><i>SCENE 6 - LAWNDALE HIGH SCHOOL - O'NEILL'S CLASSROOM</i></b>
<p><i>(O'Neill is at his desk, grading papers)</i>
<p>O'Neill - <i>(sighs)</i> Tsk, tsk. Oh, Kevin. Well, maybe you'll find a job that doesn't require the ability to read and write.
<p>Barch <i>(OS)</i> - I'm so depressed!
<p>O'Neill - Janet!
<p><i>(Barch stands just inside the door)</i>
<p>Barch - Do you know what today is? D-Day, the fifth anniversary of my D-vorce. <font color="red"><b>Five years since that lazy, no good, self-proclaimed man had his cowardly desertion of me legalized.</b></font>
<p>O'Neill - Janet, I'm sorry.
<p><i>(Barch advances toward O'Neill)</i>
<p>Barch - <i>You're</i> sorry? You didn't spend years of your life telling him again and again to get his grubby hands off of the remote, quit his damned coughing, stop behaving like an imbecile, only to be tossed into the trash like a broken record!
<p>O'Neill - Um, Janet! I can certainly understand your, um, sadness.
<p><i>(cut to DeMartino, who overhears the conversation and looks flabbergasted, with one eye bulging)</i>
<p>O'Neill <i>(OS)</i> - Why, marriage is a sacred union that's supposed to represent the love and trust two people...
<p><i>(cut to O'Neill and Barch)</i>
<p>Barch - Skinny, what did you say?
<p>O'Neill - Marriage is a sacred union that...
<p>Barch - Yeeees!
<p>O'Neill - Euh... yes?
<p>Barch - I accept!
<p>O'Neill - Um, hmmm, huh?
<p>Barch - My silly, silly Skinny. You don't have to ask again. Yes, I will marry you!
<p><i>(close-up of DeMartino - both his eyes are bloodshot)</i>
<p><i>(camera back to O'Neill and Barch)</i>
<p>O'Neill <i>(while Barch kisses him)</i> - Oh, dear!
<p><hr>
<p><b><i>SCENE 7 - MORGENDORFFER HOUSE</i></b>
<p><i>(Kay and Tom arrive in front of Daria's house, driving a white car; cut to Morgendorffer living room; Daria is coming downstairs carrying a suitcase, Helen is looking outside by the window, and Jake is sitting on the sofa, reading his newspaper)</i>
<p>Helen - Daria, the Sloanes are here.
<p><font color="red"><b>Daria - Remember, if I'm not back in Lawndale in four days, don't send anyone out looking for me.</b></font>
<p>Jake - Hey, is Middleton is on this whirlwind college tour of yours, kiddo?
<p>Daria - Umm, not this trip.
<p>Jake - Oh, um, Daria, you know, some people just aren't cut out for military school.
<p>Daria - I know, Dad, but I think it's admirable the way you've managed to pull your life together despite that early trauma.
<p>Jake - Hey, thanks kiddo. I... What?
<p>Helen - Now Daria, when you meet the college representatives, please try to be enthusiastic... less unenthusiastic...? <i>(sighs)</i> At least promise me you won't physically assault anyone.
<p><font color="red"><b>Daria - Relax, my pom-poms are packed.
<p><i>(Doorbell rings)</i>
<p>Daria - Good Attitude Land, here I come.
<p><i>(Daria opens door to reveal Tom)</i>
<p>Tom - Ready?</b></font>
<p><hr>
<p><b><i>SCENE 8 - GOVERNOR'S PARK</i></b>
<p><i>(the manager escorts the newly-hired Quinn to the hostess station, which is currenly manned by a tall blonde with a ponytail)</i>
<p>Michael - Lindy, this is Quinn. I just hired her to be our new hostess.
<p>Lindy - Great! I can really use the help. Have you done hostessing before?
<p>Quinn - Actually, um, this is my first job.
<p>Lindy - Really? Are you still in high school?
<p>Quinn - Umm, yeah. Although, people say I dress like I'm older.
<p>Lindy - Well, this isn't all that different from high school, except instead of telling teachers your homework isn't ready, you're telling customers their table isn't ready. And they can't take a single point off your grade.
<p><i>(Quinn laughs)</i>
<p><hr>
<p><b><i>SCENE 9 - SLOANES' CAR</i></b>
<p><i>(Kay is driving, Tom in front passenger seat and Daria in back seat)</i>
<p>Kay - Tom, if I'd known you were going to wear those scuffed-up sneakers, I would have bought you new ones.
<p>Tom - But I just got new ones a year ago.
<p>Kay - That's exactly what your father would say. You two are so stuck in your ways.
<p>Tom - <i>We're</i> stuck in our ways? <i>(imitating his mother)</i> Two sugars, a tiny slice of lemon would be dreamy, just place it on the saucer, dear, I don't like it in the cup.
<p>Kay - <i>(small laugh)</i> I can't help if I'm particular about my tea. Oh, look. We're here!
<p><i>(car pulls into the Bromwell University campus)</i>
<p><hr>
<p><b><i>SCENE 10 - GOVERNOR'S PARK</i></b>
<p>Shawna - Boy, did I do well tonight. A lot of the guys trying to distract their dates from their toupees by leaving big tips.
<p>Quinn - Hmm. Must be first dates.
<p>Lindy - Really? Why?
<p>Quinn - Well, not that I date inconsistent tippers, but some of my friends say that guys tip twenty percent on the first date, seventeen on the second, and fifteen on the third. Although to be fair, a lot of people order more food on the third date because they're not as worried about looking like pigs.
<p><i>(Lindy and Shawna laugh; after a moment, Quinn laughs, too)</i>
<p>Shawna - Quinn, you're a riot.
<p>Quinn - I know!
<p>Lindy - Hey, I don't know if you guys are interested, but my roommate and I are having a party on Saturday.
<p>Shawna - Sounds cool.
<p>Quinn - I'd love to go!
<p>Lindy - Great. Let me write down my address.
<p><hr>
<p><b><i>SCENE 11 - LANDON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM</i></b>
<p><i>(Andrew Landon is reading the paper as Jodie enters the room)</i>
<p>Andrew - You call that a tax cut? I've seen haircuts more drastic.
<p>Jodie - Um, Dad? Could I talk to you a second?
<p>Andrew - Sure! What's on your mind?
<p>Jodie - Well, I've been thinking a lot about Crestmore, and a lot about Turner.
<p>Andrew - Turner's a great school. Not nearly as elite as Crestmore, though.
<p>Jodie - That's just it. I don't want to go to an elitist school.
<p>Andrew - Sure you do.
<p>Jodie - I want to go to a school where I fit in, where I can be myself and relax for once and really focus on learning. I want to go to Turner. At least for a year or two.
<p>Andrew - You want to go to college to relax? That doesn't sound like my Honor Society daughter.
<p>Jodie - Relax socially; stop being the black kid, and just being a kid. I'm tired of being in the extreme minority, and I don't want to go to a place where people might think I got in just because I'm African-American.
<p>Andrew - Let people think what they want.
<p>Jodie - But Dad, you don't know what it's like. You went to a black high school and then to Turner.
<p>Andrew - Because I HAD to. If I had a Crestmore degree in my pocket... Jodie, their graduates are literally running this country. Think of how that degree can help you catapult ahead. <font color="red"><b>I'm not saying your life won't be harder until you graduate, but it will be a hell of a lot easier after. Four years versus the rest of your life.</b></font> Where is that Landon spirit?
<p><i>(Jodie looks crestfallen)</i>
<p><hr>
<p><b><i>SCENE 12 - LANE HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM</i></b>
<p><i>(Jane is using an arc welder on a sculpture; she stops and raises her face shield as Trent enters)</i>
<p>Jane - What's shaking, bacon?
<p>Trent - <i>(sniffs air)</i> I don't smell anything. Hey, cool sculpture. It's like a comment on the underbelly of pain... or something.
<p>Jane - Actually, it's a comment on BFAC's incredibly high admission standards. <font color="red"><b>Do you think it needs more lima beans?</b></font>
<p>Trent - <font color="red"><b>Nah</b></font>. Um, why do you want to go to art college? You're already an artist.
<p>Jane - I know. But I want to be a starving artist, so I need to ring up more debt.
<p>Trent - Well, I'd never go to music school. I wouldn't want any teachers trying to corrupt my vision.
<p><font color="red"><b>Jane - And that is their evil plan.
<p>Trent- Tell me about it. I mean,</b></font> can you imagine what Spiral would sound like if we were, like, forced to practice, even when we don't want to?
<p>Jane - Umm... oh, lookie, missed a spot. <i>(Jane quickly resumes her work)</i>
<p><hr>
<p><b><i>SCENE 13 - BROMWELL UNIVERSITY CAMPUS</i></b>
<p>Kay - There it is, Tom: the place where your father and I met. I was a sophomore, Angier was a senior. It was a free concert by the Carpenters.
<p>Daria - Um, I hope you weren't injured in the ensuing riot.
<p>Tom - Well, I guess Daria and I better go in for our meetings. <font color="red"><b>Don't want to get points off for being late.
<p>Daria - Especially when we can get them off just for being ourselves.</b></font>
<p>Kay - <font color="red"><b>Little chance of that, I'm sure. I'll see you later.</b></font> Good luck!
<p>Tom - Thanks.
<p><font color="red"><b>Daria - Thanks. Your parents met at a free Carpenters concert?
<p>Tom - Not only that, I'm pretty sure my Dad had cotton in his ears, just in case the music got too raucous.</b></font>
<p><hr>
<p><b><i>SCENE 14 - BROMWELL UNIVERSITY - ADMISSIONS OFFICE</i></b>
<p>Tom - Hi. We have appointments to see Lisa Goldwin.
<p><i>(clock goes from 3:00 PM to 3:45 PM)</i>
<p><i>(Lisa steps out of her office with Tom)</i>
<p>Lisa - So that's why the skating rink has that sign saying "clothes required."
<p>Tom - Well, according to my grandfather, anyway. Then again, his motto is, "never let the truth get in the way of a good story."
<p>Lisa - <i>(shaking hands with Tom)</i> Tom, it was really nice meeting you.
<p>Tom - You too, Lisa. Daria, I guess it's your turn. See you later.
<p>Lisa - Come on in, Daria. Are you as full of Bromwell lore as Tom?
<p>Daria - Um, I doubt it. He seems to be really full of it.
<p><i>(inside Lisa's office)</i>
<p>Lisa - Daria, now that you've had a chance to drink in the campus, so to speak, what are your impressions.
<p>Daria <i>(VO)</i> - Talk about the atmosphere? No, that's frivolous. The resources? No, she'll think I mean money. The campus? No, shallow. Oh no, inappropriately long pause. Talk, say anything.
<p>Daria - Ummm, I like the campus, the dorms, and, um, libraries... the learning... feeling?
<p>Daria <i>(VO)</i> - The learning feeling? Could I be any less articulate?
<p>Lisa - Yes, we like those things, too. Tell me, Daria, aside from gaining a first-rate education from one of the finest faculties around, why did you want to attend Bromwell?
<p>Daria <i>(VO)</i> - Should I talk about wanting to be a writer and hoping Bromwell will help me find my voice? Oh, God, how pretentious can I get?
<p>Daria - Um, well, I guess I'm hoping that if I come here, I may be exposed to, um, points of view I never considered.
<p>Lisa - Right, education. But what are you hoping to reap from your Bromwell experience?
<p>Daria <i>(VO)</i> - Reap? Reap... reap reap!
<p>Daria - Um, I hope to reap...
<p>Daria <i>(VO)</i> - God, what does she want?
<p>Daria - Ummm, a chance to grow...?
<p>Daria <i>(VO)</i> - I did not say that!
<p>Lisa - You're asking me?
<p>Daria - Um, well, I think at Bromwell, I can, umm...
<p>Lisa - Find your voice, perhaps?
<p>Daria - Hmm, yes, exactly. Find my voice.
<p>Daria <i>(VO)</i> - Note to self: stop thinking so much, Morgendorffer, you idiot!
<p>Lisa - Daria, is everything all right?
<p>Daria - Ummm, do you think we might possibly start over, and this time, I'll just answer your questions instead of agonizing over them internally and then blurting out something asinine?
<p>Lisa - <i>(laughs)</i> Sure.
<p><hr>
<p><b><i>SCENE 15 - LAWNDALE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY</i></b>
<p><i>(Quinn, Tiffany, and Stacy at Quinn's locker)</i>

<p>Daria - I'm not saying everyone has to go to college. I'm saying old footloose Jane Lane doesn't know all there is to know yet about art or anything else, and may be making an ill-advised decision to end her education based on temporary, if admittedly justified, disappointment.

<p>Daria - Your uncle built them a wing. The only thing that might have kept you out of Bromwell is a murder conviction, and even then, only if you'd killed the Dean of Students.
<p>Tom - Hey, it's not my fault you had a shaky interview.
<p>Daria - Yes, well, nothing like dropping a few ancestor anecdotes to convince them of your qualifications. I got into Raft without any interview at all.
<p>Tom - I'm not gonna touch that one.

<p>Daria - Tom got into Bromwell. So you see, they're not rejecting everyone.
<p>Helen - Oh, well, some people have a certain... edge over the rest of us.
<p>Daria - You don't say. <i>(sighs)</i> Look, I didn't mean to snap at you, but you're the one who told me about the advantages of a Bromwell education.
<p>Helen - That doesn't mean Raft...
<p>Daria - I didn't get into the school that I wanted, and you wanted for me. What am I supposed to think about my prospects?
<p>Helen - Your prospects? Daria, you'll be going to your second choice college, not prison. Look at me: I went to Middleton. It's not half the school that Raft is.
<p>Daria - What?
<p>Helen - Middleton's not half the school that Raft is, as you know damned well. I applied to college during the height of the baby boom. Competition was so fierce I got rejected from my first <i>and</i> second choices. And, see, I lived to tell about it.
<p>Daria - Hmm.
<p>Helen - I made the most of the education I did get, and so will you. Raft is an excellent school. You should be very proud. I know I am.
<p>Daria - Um, Dad seems to think Middleton's hot stuff.
<p>Helen - Your father needs to maintain certain illusions about his youth in order to function. It's... <i>(forced laugh)</i> ...cute.
<p>Daria - I hope I don't end up the same way.
<p>Helen - Daria, you're destined for great things no matter where you go to school. I know it.
<p>Daria - Hmmm. All right, then. I suppose I can stop worrying about getting into college and start worrying about this disgusting elitism I have managed to develop during the process.
<p>Helen - Good. That'll keep you from worrying about what kind of weirdo you'll get for a roommate.

<p>Mack - I hope you don't think I'm out of line, but Jodie's been acting really unhappy lately, and I think it's because of Crestmore.
<p>Andrew - Impossible! We had a long talk about it and she's really looking forward to going.
<p>Mack - With all due respect, sir, I don't believe that's true. <font color="red"><b>She's been putting a lot of pressure on herself for a long time.</b></font> I think she really needs a different kind of environment. Like Turner.

<p>Daria - It's just that the whole thing smacks of some crappy romance novel where the troubled young viscount decides the lowly stable girl is good enough for him after all.
<p>Jane - I always saw you as more of a scullery maid.
<p>Daria - And why should the Sloane's seal of approval matter more to Bromwell than my transcripts?
<p>Jane - "Dear Dean Skippy, please admit Daria. She's a fine young woman, even if she isn't one of us."
<p>Daria - Exactly. Besides, if they write a recommendation, it'll just make it that much worse when I do get that ultimate rejection.
<p>Jane - You are very wise for a humble laundress, and generous, too. How come you bought the pizza?
<p>Daria - To make you feel too guilty to storm off in a huff when I ask if you've sent your portfolio in to BFAC yet.
<p>Jane - Why bother? It's too late.
<p>Daria - Not for mid-year enrollment.
<p>Jane - Daria, I already told you. I'm just not the college type.

<p>Daria - So it's the old "reject them before they reject me."
<p>Jane - Yeah, the same thing you're doing with Bromwell.
<p>Daria - I was already rejected by Bromwell.
<p>Jane - So was I. By State U and Lawndale State.
<p>Daria - But you told me you don't care what their sucky art departments thought of your work.
<p>Jane - Really. They're so sucky they didn't even ask to see it.
<p>Daria - What?
<p>Jane - They didn't ask to see any of my stuff, so I didn't send any.
<p>Daria - Wait. You get rejected by schools that don't care if you have artistic talent, but the one that does care, you decide not to go for?
<p>Jane - For the same reason you're not gonna let the Sloanes write a letter that might get you into Bromwell, even though you wouldn't have to lift a finger. Rejection sucks. You said so yourself.
<p>Daria - I'll make you a deal. If I prostrate myself before the Sloanes and ask them for that letter, will you finish your portfolio and send it to BFAC?
<p>Jane - God, Daria! You must really think I have a shot.
<p><font color="red"><b>Daria - And all I had to do to convince you was offer myself up for a round of thoroughly gratuitous humiliation.

<p>Quinn - This girl I was working with... I think she has a drinking problem. If I don't say anything, I'm afraid she'll get an accident or something, but if I do say something, she'll probably never speak to me again. Not that she is now.
<p>Daria - I don't really feel qualified to give any advice on interpersonal relationships today.
<p>Quinn - Why not?
<p>Daria - I just broke up with my boyfriend. It's kind of a first for me. So's this feeling in my stomach like it's been through a paper shedder.
<p>Quinn - You broke up with Tom?
<p>Daria - You sound almost surprised as I was.
<p>Quinn - Why?
<p>Daria - Because I felt we'd come to the end of our relationship, for a bunch of reasons, and we should both move on.
<p>Quinn - So you said that to him, just like that? <font color="red"><b>You didn't want to wait so you'd have someone to go out with for the summer?
<p>Daria - No, although I'm sure Tom would have been very flattered at being asked to play the role of warm body.

<p>Daria - For some reason, I continue to opt for honesty, despite mounting evidence that it's inexorably transforming me into an old woman alone in a one room apartment filled with thirty year old newspapers and cats.
<p>Quinn - Oh, Daria, that's not gonna happen to you. I was at a college party. I know what goes on there. People are smart and nice.
<p>Daria - So it's the opposite of high school?
<p>Quinn - You're gonna have friends and everything. I know it sounds hard to believe.
<p>Daria - Gee, thanks. But, um, thanks.
<p>Quinn - You were right to be honest. That's what I'm gonna do.
<p>Daria - Good. You can help me feed the cats.

<p>Quinn - Why not? We're friends, right?
<p>Lindy - I mean, that was a really crappy thing I said about you borrowing my lipstick. I can't believe I did it. I was desperate.
<p>Quinn - I know.
<p>Lindy - It was, like, the worst thing I've ever done in my life, and I'm really sorry.
<p>Quinn - Lindy, I know I'm only in high school and I'm not really used to be around people who drink except for my father, but that's only when he's really mad and talking about military school and even then... and okay, my mother had a few too many at this wedding, but if you knew my aunt Rita, and I think you have a drinking problem.
<p>Lindy - <i>(small dismissive laugh)</i> All right, I hurt you, you hurt me, fair enough.
<p>Quinn - I'm not trying to hurt you, Lindy. You really need to think about your drinking.
<p>Lindy - Quinn, I'm in college. Everybody drinks. If I had a problem, it would be affecting my schoolwork or personal life, wouldn't it?
<p>Quinn - But you got fired because of it!
<p>Lindy - I got fired because Michael's a jerk. And guess what? I already found another job.
<p>Quinn - But you just said that what happened in Michael's office was the worst thing you ever did in your life. Doesn't that mean it's affecting you?
<p>Lindy - That was out of panic, and now with your nasty little accusations, you've gotten me back for. Which is what I guess you came over in the first place. So, we're even, okay? So goodbye.
<p>Quinn - Goodbye?
<p>Lindy - I've got a paper due tomorrow and I've got a lot of writing left to go. You noticed I said writing, not drinking. You'll noticed I've a got a book opened, not a bottle <i>(goes to the door and opens it)</i> And now the door's open, too.

If I had to do it all over again, I'd have started advanced placement classes in preschool so I could go from eighth grade straight to college.
<p><i>(in the stands, Helen and Jake are stricken; Quinn dons sunglasses and a baseball cap)</i>
<p>Daria - However, given the unalterable fact that high school sucks, I'd like to add that if you're lucky enough to have a good friend and a family that cares, it doesn't have to suck quite as much.
<p><i>(cut to first Jane, then to Helen and Jake, all of whom smile at Daria's words)</i>
<p>Daria - Otherwise, my advice is: stand firm for what you believe in, until and unless logic and experience prove you wrong; remember, when the emperor looks naked, the emperor <i>is</i> naked; the truth and a lie are not "sort of the same thing"; and there's no aspect, no facet, no moment of life that can't be improved with pizza. Thank you.

<p><i>(Daria and Jane are in a booth)</i>
<p>Jane - So, dazzling academic achievement, eh? What a sellout.
<p>Daria - I know. And then I had the perfect opportunity to beat Ms. Li senseless with my trophy, and what do I do? Give a heart-warming speech.
<p>Jane - You're getting soft around the edges, Morgendorffer.
<p>Daria - Maybe, or maybe you've got glaucoma.
<p>Jane - To college! I can't wait! What do you think we'll find when we get there?
<p>Daria - Hmm. That the students are shockingly ignorant, the professors self-centered and corrupt, and the entire system geared soley to the pursuit of funding?
<p>Jane - Hmmm, yes. You know that thing I said about you getting soft?
<p>Daria - Yeah?
<p>Jane - I take it back.
