<p><i>(opening theme song)</i>
<p><b><i>SCENE 1 - LAWNDALE HIGH SCHOOL</i></b>
<p><i>(The students in Mr. DeMartino's classroom are packing books into boxes and removing items from the walls. Among them are Daria, Jane, Jodie, Kevin, and Brittany. Daria, Jane, and Jodie are packing books, while Kevin and Brittany are attempting to remove a map of the United States from the wall.)</i>
<p>Mr. DeMartino - Well, <b><i>students...</i></b> I certainly <b><i>appreciate</i></b> your help in cleaning out the <b><i>classroom</i></b> for the summer. It almost makes me <b><i>forget</i></b> that <b><i>most</i></b> of you didn't learn a thing <b><i>all year!</i></b>
<p>Daria - That's not true. I learned to sleep sitting up.
<p>Kevin - <i>(turning)</i> Mr. D., as Q.B., I think I can speak for...
<p>Mr. DeMartino - <b><i>Careful with that map, Kevin!</i></b>
<p>Kevin - Eep! <i>(turns and quickly prevents map from falling)</i>
<p>Mr. DeMartino - Now... <b><i>without</i></b> turning around. Did you want to dangle a morsel of <b><i>hope</i></b> before me by announcing you're doing something <b><i>constructive</i></b> this summer, like partaking in much-needed <b><i>remedial</i></b> classes or some sort of <b><i>vocation?</i></b>
<p>Kevin - <i>(turns again)</i> I'm not going on vacation. Me and Britt are going to be lifeguards.
<p>Mr. DeMartino - <b><i>No turning, Kevin!</i></b>
<p>Kevin - Urk! <i>(turns back to map)</i>
<p>Mr. DeMartino - <b><i>Do not turn</i></b> until... did you say <b><i>lifeguards?</i></b>
<p>Brittany - It'll be really easy 'cause I already know how to use... oops! <i>(teeters and falls off the chair, ripping the map in half)</i> Um, a bullhorn?
<p>Mr. DeMartino - <i>(clutches his head)</i> Augh... argh! Why couldn't I have been born during an <b><i>influenza</i></b> epidemic? Or at the base of a <b><i>volcano?</i></b> Why did I survive, grow tall and strong, only to <b><i>squander</i></b> all my potential by becoming a <b><i>teacher?!</i></b> Argh...!
<p>Daria - When he would have made such a wonderful motivational speaker.
<p><i>(Jodie giggles, but Jane resolutely continues packing. There's obviously still tension here over "the Tom thing.")</i>
<p><hr>
<p><b><i>SCENE 2 - LAWNDALE HIGH SCHOOL</i></b>
<p><i>(Mr. O'Neill is handing back test papers to his sophomore class, which includes Quinn, Sandi, Stacy, Tiffany, Joey, Jeffy, and Jamie.)</i>
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Now remember, the P-STATs are a good "dry run" for your college boards. If you got 1,200 points or better, kudos! You'll have a wide and exciting choice of colleges. And for those with less, uh, robust scores, there are still wonderful opportunities in the food services sector.
<p>Stacy - Hmm... 940.
<p>Tiffany - 9... 02.
<p>Quinn - 955.
<p><i>(Sandi scowls at that news, because her test score is 924. Solution? Lie through her teeth, of course.)</i>
<p>Sandi - 956. I guess we're all of comparable intelligence.
<p>Tiffany - Yeah... comparable.
<p><i>(Quinn displays a "yeah, right" look, as it took Tiffany ten seconds just to say those two words. At that point, however, the dismissal bell rings.)</i>
<p>Mr. O'Neill - All right, have a rewarding and growth-filled summer, everyone. And by the way, we still have openings for counselors at the "Okay to Cry Corral", my day camp for sensitive children and those who'd like to be. It's going to be wonderful.
<p><i>(His words are falling on deaf ears, as all of his students are filing past him and out the door. All except Quinn, who approaches his desk and waits for him to notice her.)</i>
<p>Mr. O'Neill - I hope... some of... um... all right, then. I'll miss you all, too. <i>(finally notices Quinn standing there)</i> Quinn, you'd like to join the roundup at the Okay to Cry Corral and make a difference in a child's life?
<p>Quinn - Why would I want to do that? I just, um, need to ask you something.
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Problems at home? Is it your mother? She seems awfully stressed. Has she been acting out on you?
<p>Quinn - It's about my test score.
<p>Mr. O'Neill - <i>(dejected)</i> Oh...
<p>Quinn - Um, let's say you got a certain score on a test, and it wasn't terrible, but some other people got almost the same score, people you really thought you could do better than, although for personal reasons you'd rather not name them or say why?
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Um... what?
<p>Quinn - Okay, forget everything I just said. Let's try this. Can I get into Pepperhill with a 955?
<p>Mr. O'Neill - 955? Oh, dear. Well, let's see.
<p><i>(He goes to his desk and leafs through a book, presumably a reference book on universities, until he finds the entry for Pepperhill.)</i>
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Pepperhill University. It is known more for its wide range of social activities than for academics, but... ah! Uh-oh. I'm afraid to get into Pepperhill you'll need a combined score of at least 1,000.
<p>Quinn - But that's not fair! I didn't have time to study with my Fashion Club duties. Don't extracurricular activities count for anything?
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Hmm. You think you might have done better if you'd studied? Who were those other people you mentioned?
<p>Quinn - I told you to forget them.
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Eep! Of course you did. Well, Quinn, if you think studying would help, I say go for it! Take this summer to crack the books. Hire a tutor. Put your nose to the proverbial grindstone.
<p>Quinn - What's wrong with my nose?
<p><i>(Mr. O'Neill groans. Unfortunately, it's the kind of response he's come to expect from Quinn.)</i>
<p><hr>
<p><b><i>SCENE 3 - LAWNDALE HIGH SCHOOL</i></b>
<p><i>(Daria and Jane are walking down the hall, Jane slightly in front. There is obvious tension between the two.)</i>
<p>Daria - I think I'm finally finding out what it feels like to be a Lane.
<p>Jane - That can't be, since it's only afternoon and you're already out of bed.
<p>Daria - I mean the lack of tiresome parental involvement. Mine have been so busy they've completely forgotten to force me into some dumb summer activity. I'm turning into you.
<p>Jane - Well, you've got so much else of mine, you might as well have my identity.
<p>Daria - <i>(slightly indignant)</i> Hey...!
<p>Jane - Take a joke, Daria. Anyway, que ironico. You don't have summer plans, I do.
<p>Daria - Ironico's not a word.
<p>Jane - This old commune-mate of my mother's runs an artists' colony. I've been accepted into their summer program.
<p>Daria - <i>(no enthusiasm whatsoever)</i> That's great...
<p>Jane - That sounds sincere.
<p>Daria - Why didn't you say anything?
<p>Jane - I didn't want to jinx it. Two months of painting and sculpting my heart out in a college town in the middle of nowhere. Starting this weekend.
<p>Daria - Does this college town have a name, or do you just turn left at the kid with the tractor?
<p>Jane - Cheer up, Daria. Without me around, you'll have that much more time for your budding social life.
<p><i>(Daria makes a face at that; things obviously aren't going well between them, and apparently this was not the first comment of this type from Jane.)</i>
<p><hr>
<p><b><i>SCENE 4 - LAWNDALE HIGH SCHOOL</i></b>
<p><i>(The Fashion Club is dining together in the cafeteria, as usual.)</i>
<p>Quinn - This college book said you need a score of 1,000 and a B-minus average to get into Pepperhill.
<p>Stacy - God, we're only flesh and blood.
<p>Tiffany - Stacy... eww.
<p>Stacy - Sorry.
<p>Sandi - So we'll go somewhere else. Somewhere that appreciates our specialness and individuality.
<p>Quinn - But I'm sure I can do better on those tests.
<p>Sandi - You can do better?
<p>Quinn - We. Did I say me? We.
<p>Sandi - Gee, Quinn, I'm glad you think you're so much smarter than the rest of us, but you're worried about nothing. We have plenty of time to pull up our test scores next year.
<p>Stacy - Yeah! No sweat.
<p>Tiffany - Stacy... eww.
<p>Stacy - Sorry.
<p><hr>
<p><b><i>SCENE 5 - THE MORGENDORFFER HOUSE</i></b>
<p><i>(Jake is eating a stack of waffles at the kitchen counter, while Daria is making toast. Helen is rummaging through the refrigerator.)</i>
<p>Daria - More waffles, Dad? I found an extra stick of butter.
<p>Jake - No thanks... the old diet, you know. <i>(looks closer at the box of frozen waffles)</i> May second? Hey! It's June! These waffles have expired!
<p>Helen - Relax, Jake. That's a sell-by date. They've been frozen since then. They're fine.
<p>Jake - Easy for you to say. You didn't just eat four poisoned waffles!
<p>Daria - Mom's right. Besides, if you had food poisoning you'd be developing a very mild stomachache by now.
<p>Jake - A mild stomachache? I think I have one, damn it!
<p><i>(Helen is done in the fridge, so she turns to address Jake's latest neurosis.)</i>
<p>Helen - Jake, can't you ever tell when anyone's joking?
<p>Jake - Of course I can. Um... you're not doing it now, are you?
<p>Helen - It's June?! Oh, my gosh, Daria, what are you doing this summer?
<p>Daria - I was wondering when you'd ask, but don't worry. I have a job.
<p>Jake - Good for you, kiddo.
<p>Helen - I see... and what exactly is this job?
<p>Daria - I'm sorry, but the confidentiality agreement I signed with the government prevents me from revealing that. I've already said too much.
<p>Jake - Wow! I mean, wow, what a funny joke.
<p>Helen - Daria, I'm serious. I'm not going to let you sit around the house all summer.
<p>Daria - Fine. I'll lie around the house all summer.
<p><i>(Quinn walks into the kitchen, and is immediately ambushed by Helen)</i>
<p>Helen - Quinn, what are your plans for the summer?
<p>Quinn - All right, I admit it! My P-STAT scores were a little low.
<p>Helen - What?
<p>Quinn - Sandi said we have plenty of time to catch up next year.
<p>Helen - What about all the new things you'll have to learn then?
<p>Daria - Yeah. The second half of the alphabet is even harder than the first.
<p>Quinn - Oh, great. So you think I should get a tutor, too. Aren't there, like, any TV shows I can watch?
<p>Daria - Good idea. You wouldn't want to flunk the essay section on <i>Matlock</i>.
<p>Jake - Ha! <i>Matlock</i>.
<p>Helen - Well, if you don't want a tutor, then...
<p>Quinn - Fine! A tutor it is.
<p><i>(And Quinn walks out, leaving her confused family in her wake.)</i>
<p><hr>
<p><b><i>SCENE 6 - LAWNDALE HIGH SCHOOL</i></b>
<p><i>(Kevin, Brittany, Mack, and Jodie are in the hallway, signing each others' yearbooks. Other students are cleaning out their lockers.)</i>
<p>Brittany - Just make it out to me -- Brittany!
<p>Jodie - Gee... thanks for clearing that up.
<p>Brittany - You're welcome! What are you guys doing this summer?
<p><i>(Jodie assumes "the position"... she's obviously recited this one too many times.)</i>
<p>Jodie - Two internships, volunteer community service, a part-time job and, in my spare time, golf lessons.
<p>Kevin - Wow! What about you, Mack Daddy?
<p>Mack - Driving an ice-cream truck.
<p>Kevin - <i>(laughs)</i> That's not very prestidigitatious.
<p>Mack - Thanks for pointing that out.
<p>Kevin - You're welcome.
<p>Jodie - Mack owes his father some money and I think it's very conscientious of him to take that job and pay him back.
<p>Mack - Yeah. He gets the money, I get the humiliation.
<p>Jodie - Mack, it'll be fine.
<p>Brittany - Wait... isn't golf for old people who dress funny?
<p>Jodie - Yeah -- my parents. They're trying to get into Winged Tree Country Club and they want me to learn how to play.
<p>Kevin - Hey, do you get to wear one of those little hats and ring that bell that goes ding-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling? <i>(laughs)</i> A-ling?
<p><i>(Mack grumbles. Kevin probably doesn't know how close he came to getting flattened right on the spot. Elsewhere, the Fashion Club is strolling down another hallway, presumably looking for yearbook signers.)</i>
<p>Sandi - So I told my parents, all right, I'll go with you on your little trip to Bermuda, but don't expect me to take part in any family luaus.
<p>Quinn - But isn't it Hawaii where they do luaus?
<p>Sandi - Gee, Quinn, that's exactly what my mother said. Maybe you should go with them.
<p>Stacy - What are you doing this summer, Quinn?
<p>Quinn - Oh, nothing special. See some movies, catch up on my dating... <i>(quietly)</i> get a tutor.
<p>Sandi - A tutor?
<p>Stacy - Oh, Quinn, I'm so sorry.
<p>Tiffany - Really...
<p>Quinn - I know. It's terrible. But my mother's making me. Um, you guys will keep it to yourselves, won't you?
<p>Stacy - Of course.
<p>Sandi - You can trust us.
<p>Tiffany - You have our word...
<p>Quinn - You guys are the best!
<p><i>(And in yet another hallway, Daria and Jane are headed for their lockers, the tension between them thicker than ever.)</i>
<p>Daria - I think we should talk.
<p>Jane - Okay. <i>(stiffly)</i> We are now talking.
<p>Daria - About the Tom thing.
<p>Jane - That I don't want to talk about.
<p>Daria - If you're still upset about it, we should deal with it now. Especially since we won't be seeing each other all summer.
<p>Jane - You don't get it, do you? I don't want to talk about it. I don't want to think about it. I told you, I'm not mad at you about Tom. Now let it <font color="#ff0000"><b>freaking</b></font> go, okay?
<p>Daria - Can I at least take you out for a good-luck pizza before you leave for your big art adventure?
<p>Jane - Daria, I said let it go.
<p><i>(And Jane leaves a dejected Daria in the dust. It's going to be a loooong summer.)</i>
<p><hr>
<p><b><i>SCENE 7 - THE MORGENDORFFER HOUSE</i></b>
<p><i>(Jake is sitting on the living room couch, reading the paper, when Helen walks into the room)</i>
<p>Helen - Jake, put the paper down. That boy Daria's been dating is on his way over.
<p>Jake - You mean Quinn's been dating.
<p>Helen - No, Daria.
<p>Jake - Oh! Good one, honey. Old Jake Morgendorffer sure appreciates a funny joke.
<p>Helen - Jake, will you listen to me, please? Daria's been out with this Tom several times and we're finally going to meet him, and I want to make sure we have our game plan together.
<p>Jake - Wait, I remember now. The guy without any vocal cords.
<p>Helen - I want you to stay cool and relaxed and not embarrass her by getting all nervous and crazy.
<p>Jake - <i>(still not listening)</i> Daria said he communicates by blinking. Now was it one blink for yes or one blink for no?
<p>Helen - Jake, she was joking!
<p>Jake - I know! Ha-ha-ha-ha...! Now, what's the game plan?
<p>Helen - The game plan is, you don't say a word.
<p>Jake - So he won't feel self-conscious about the vocal cords, right?
<p>Helen - Oh...!
<p><i>(The doorbell rings. Helen opens the door, to find Tom standing on the front stoop.)</i>
<p>Helen - Hello! You must be Tom.
<p>Tom - I...
<p>Helen - I'm Helen Morgendorffer.
<p>Tom - Glad to...
<p>Helen - Won't you come in?
<p>Tom - I'd...
<p>Helen - Great!
<p><i>(Tom makes a dejected face -- he obviously isn't used to not being able to get in a word edgewise -- and follows Helen into the house.)</i>
<p>Helen - We've heard so much about you, Tom.
<p>Tom - Really?
<p>Helen - Um, well, actually...
<p>Jake - <i>(leaps off the couch)</i> Hey there, young man! Jake Morgendorffer.
<p>Tom - <i>(shaking Jake's hand)</i> Hi, I'm Tom Sloane.
<p>Helen - Sloane? Not the same Sloane as in Grace, Sloane and Page?
<p>Tom - Well, that's my dad, so I guess...
<p>Jake - Grace, Sloane and Page?! Hey, sign me up for a little of that insider trading. <i>(Helen and Tom scowl at Jake's tasteless joke as Daria descends the stairs)</i> Ha-ha! Little joke, of course. Class firm like your father's would never, uh, mmm... <i>(he's getting nowhere)</i> Say, you know, my vocal cords hurt. I'd better go gargle.
<p><i>(Daria and Tom finally escape the house and proceed to Tom's car.)</i>
<p>Daria - Sorry about that. They've been acting a little strange ever since, oh, I can remember.
<p><i>(Tom gives Daria a quick kiss, and Daria responds with a small smile.)</i>
<p>Tom - Pizza?
<p>Daria - Okay.
<p><i>(They finally reach his car. It's not his old rustbucket. It's a new rustbucket -- a Jaguar -- though in obviously better condition than his old Ford Pinto.)</i>
<p>Daria - What's this?
<p>Tom - My new car. Well, my grandmother's old one.
<p>Daria - Did you <i>want</i> this car?
<p>Tom - Well, yeah, after my parents had my old one towed away in the middle of the night. <i>(climbs behind the wheel)</i>
<p>Daria - <i>(gets into the passenger seat)</i> Note to self: leave Quinn out on curb tonight.
<p><hr>
<p><b><i>SCENE 8 - DOWNTOWN LAWNDALE</i></b>
<p><i>(Daria and Tom are walking towards Pizza King, when who should appear but Kevin and Brittany)</i>
<p>Brittany - Oh, hi, Daria!
<p>Daria - Um, hello.
<p>Kevin - Hey, Daria, I didn't know you had a brother.
<p>Daria - What?
<p>Brittany - Jane's going out with your brother? Wow!
<p>Daria  - What?
<p>Brittany - You're Tom, right? Jane's boyfriend?
<p>Tom - Well, I'm Tom, but...
<p>Kevin - How long have you and Daria been brothers? I mean, how long has Daria been your brother? Wait a minute, uh...
<p>Tom - Actually...
<p>Daria - Um, listen, it's been great talking and all, but we've got to get back to the Rent-a-Brother shop before they charge us for an extra day. Bye.
<p><i>(Daria and Tom walk away)</i>
<p>Kevin - You know what, babe? I don't think he's her brother at all.
<p>Tom - What's the matter?
<p>Daria - I can't do this. I can't spend the evening in there explaining to people that no, you're not my brother, and no, you're not Jane's boyfriend, you're actually my, uh...
<p>Tom - Yes?
<p>Daria - Guy I'm dating.
<p>Tom - Okay. I understand. I know, let's bag the pizza place and go to my parents' club.
<p>Daria - You're not much for crafty strategizing, are you?
<p>Tom - Nobody knows you there. Besides, they charge my folks for meals whether they eat them or not, so we might as well get their money's worth.
<p>Daria - Tom, as much as I'd like to help your family in their time of need...
<p><i>(The Fashion Club chooses that moment to walk by, with each member appraising Tom as they pass.)</i>
<p>Daria - Do they have cheddar fries?
<p><hr>
<p><b><i>SCENE 9 - WINGED TREE COUNTRY CLUB</i></b>
<p><i>(Daria and Tom are sitting in the elegant dining room; it's obvious that it's a haven for the well-off)</i>
<p>Tom - Think you'll come visit me while I'm working in my father's office this month? <i>(fake enthusiasm)</i> You can help me file earnings reports.
<p>Daria - Oh, sure, that old line. <i>(looks around at the other members)</i> Boy, you can really smell the mold on the old money in here, can't you?
<p>Tom - Better on the money than on the food. Uh-oh...
<p>Daria - Someone pull out a new twenty?
<p><i>(Worse: Angier, Katherine, and Elsie Sloane -- Tom's parents and younger sister -- approach their table. They're dressed in that rich-but-trying-not-to-flaunt-it way. Elsie apparently is not enjoying herself.)</i>
<p>Tom - Mom, Dad... Elsie. Daria, this is my mother and father and my sister, Elsie.
<p><i>(the Sloanes and Daria exchange greetings)</i>
<p>Kay - I just spoke with Aunt Mildred. She's made a lot of improvements on the house.
<p>Elsie - She had the screen door fixed.
<p>Tom - We always spend August at the cove with my great Aunt Mildred. It's kind of a tradition.
<p>Elsie - In other words, we don't have a choice.
<p>Kay - Elsie!
<p>Angier - How about you, Daria? I'll bet you have something fun planned for the summer.
<p>Daria - Um...
<p>Tom - Actually, Daria's just going to relax. She's earned it -- she made high honor roll all three trimesters.
<p>Kay - Fielding doesn't have trimesters.
<p>Daria - I go to Lawndale High.
<p>Kay - Oh. <i>(pause)</i> Well, high honor roll is an achievement at any school.
<p>Daria - Actually, at ours it just means you managed to stay out of prison all year.
<p><i>(There's an uncomfortable pause before Elsie starts to laugh, followed by Angier and Kay. Daria, however, is less than thrilled with being put on the spot.)</i>
<p><i>(Later... Tom and Daria are parked in front of the Morgendorffer house.)</i>
<p>Tom - Sorry about the family onslaught.
<p>Daria - No big deal. Your parents had to find out you were dating me sometime.
<p>Tom - Does that bother you? That I hadn't told them about you?
<p>Daria - <i>(hesitantly)</i> No.
<p>Tom - Daria, I never tell them about anyone I'm dating.
<p>Daria - Now I <i>really</i> feel special.
<p>Tom - Well, you should. Because I like you.
<p>Daria - Thanks. Um, I'd better be going.
<p>Tom - Hold on. I want to ask you... do you, you know... feel the same way about me?
<p>Daria - Uh, yeah. Sure. Bye.
<p><i>(Daria gets out of the car -- quickly -- leaving Tom pleased, but oblivious to Daria's discomfort.)</i>
<p><hr>
<p><b><i>SCENE 10 - THE MORGENDORFFER HOUSE</i></b>
<p><i>(A young man strolls up the walkway to the front door and rings the doorbell. After a moment, Daria opens the front door.)</i>
<p>David - Hi, I'm David Sorenson. Are you Quinn?
<p>Daria - I don't know. Is this the ninth circle of Hell?
<p>David - The <U>Divine Comedy.</U>
<p>Daria - Wait a minute, you know that? All right. Who are you and what do you want with my sister?
<p>David - I'm here to tutor her.
<p>Daria - Seriously.
<p><i>(Helen arrives and opens the door wide.)</i>
<p>Helen - Quinn, your tutor's here! David, hi. Helen Morgendorffer. <i>(shakes David's hand, then scowls at Daria)</i> Don't mind Daria. Unemployment does strange things to one's mind.
<p><i>(Helen and David sit in the living room)</i>
<p>Helen - Eric tells me you've worked wonders with his niece.
<p>David - Jasmine's been doing very well. Of course, it makes my job easier to have the support of involved parents.
<p>Helen - <i>(chuckles nervously)</i> Yes. Quinn!
<p><i>(David and Quinn sit in the kitchen)</i>
<p>David - I see here that you took European History last year. I guess there's no need repeating that.
<p>Quinn - Oh, yeah. Napoleon, Waterworld, the A La Carta.
<p>David - Hmm... "revisit European history." Moving on to literature. I want you to check off all the books you've read. <i>(hands Quinn a list)</i> No point in assigning <U>Ethan Frome</U> or <U>Silas Marner</U> again.
<p>Quinn - What did they write?
<p>David - <i>(laughs)</i> Uh... okay. How's this for an idea? You tell me which are your best subjects.
<p>Quinn - Well, let's see... I have an unerring color sense.
<p><i>(At that, David does not look at all impressed, as evidenced by the "this is going to be tougher than I thought" look on his face.)</i>
<p><hr>
<p><b><i>SCENE 11 - ASHFIELD COMMUNITY FOR THE ARTS</i></b>
<p><i>(The director is escorting Jane to her cabin. Her attitude and mannerisms are something of a cross between Amanda Lane and Claire Defoe.)</i>
<p>Director - I got a postcard from your mother. Boy, do I envy her in Death Valley.
<p>Jane - Can you believe there are some people who wouldn't want to go there in July?
<p>Director - I know... here we are.
<p><i>(The director opens the door of the cabin to reveal a group of young women, all of whom are lounging around the common area of the cabin. They're all dressed in black, and sport oh!-so-trendy haircuts complete with offbeat colors.)</i>
<p>Caroline - I'm not saying Fauvism didn't have its place, but now it just looks like so much black-velvet junk at the swap-meet.
<p>Paris - That's not fair. You can't evaluate the work outside the context of its time.
<p>Caroline - You can if it's good.
<p>Director - <i>(clears throat)</i> Everyone, I'd like you to meet your new housemate, Jane. Jane... Caroline, Jett, Anais, and Paris.
<p>Jane - Hey.
<p><i>(All of the girls murmur greetings.)</i>
<p>Director - Enjoy. I'll see you later. <i>(she leaves)</i>
<p>Jane - Thanks.
<p>Jett - Nice haircut.
<p>Jane - Thanks, I...
<p>Caroline - Anyway, color is not something you just fling around like a dog marking its territory.
<p><i>(The girls murmur responses as Jane looks on and wonders what to make of her new roommates.)</i>

<p><b><i>SCENE 12 - LAWNDALE PUBLIC POOL</i></b>
<p><i>(Kevin and Brittany are dressed in full lifeguard regalia. Kevin is wearing red swim trunks, while Brittany is wearing a red one-piece bathing suit. Both are sporting whistles.)</i>
<p>Brittany - Kevvy! You look so cute.
<p>Kevin - And you look hot.
<p>Brittany - And your muscles, they're so ripply.
<p>Kevin - Aw, babe.
<p><i>(Behind them, a kid can be seen choking and waving his arms. He's clearly in distress, and it's just as clear that Kevin and Brittany are totally oblivious to his plight.)</i>
<p>Lifeguard - Hey! You guys are supposed to be watching the pool!
<p>Kevin - What about this arm? Is it ripply, too?
<p>Brittany - Ooh... let me see how ripply. Oh...
<p><i>(The senior lifeguard jumps into the pool and pulls the kid to safety. As she does so, she shoots an angry glance at the two lovebirds.)</i>

<p><b><i>SCENE 13 - THE MORGENDORFFER HOUSE</i></b>
<p><i>(It's 1:00 in the afternoon, and Daria is still sound asleep. Helen walks into the bedroom and opens a curtain; she's definitely not very pleased. Later that evening, Helen is on the living room sofa as Daria heads for the front door.)</i>
<p>Daria - Can't talk... top secret mission.
<p>Helen - Well, complete your mission soon because I'm sending you on another one. Mr. O'Neill called looking for day camp volunteers and I signed you up.
<p>Daria - You didn't.
<p>Helen - You start Monday. I'm sorry, but you're not staying locked up in your room all summer.
<p>Daria - So instead, you're going to lock me up with a busload of whiny kids and the poor man's Kathy Lee Gifford.
<p>Helen - Daria, you need to be more tolerant. You know what they say. "Judge and be judged."
<p>Daria - And I judge myself unfit for human contact.
<p>Helen - That's exactly what you will be if you don't start engaging with the rest of us. <i>(stands up)</i> You keep hiding your real face behind that antisocial mask and one day the mask will be your face. I'm not letting that happen. You're working at that camp. <i>(leaves)</i>
<p>Daria - What about my feelings? What about my rights? <i>(door shuts)</i> What about my bribe?

<p><b><i>SCENE 14 - THE MORGNEDORFFER HOUSE</i></b>
<p><i>(Quinn and David are in the middle of a tutoring session. Well, David is, anyway; Quinn is on the phone with Stacy.)</i>
<p>Quinn - But Stacy, how can I possibly decide if you should wear your chocolate brown or beige brown headband if you haven't picked out your eyeliner? <i>(looks over at David, and sees how angry he's getting)</i> Beige brown, bye. <i>(hangs up)</i> Sorry.
<p>David - Okay. As I was saying, people in the Middle Ages were in constant...
<p>Quinn - God, we're still in the Middle Ages? I mean, things were so depressing then, and everyone was so short. <i>(phone rings, Quinn answers)</i> Sandi, hi. I'm kind of bus... she wore under-the-knee knee socks? No!
<p><i>(David has finally had enough; he starts packing up his books.)</i>
<p>Quinn - Hang on a second. Where are you going?
<p>David - Far, far away.
<p>Quinn - Sandi, I'll call you right back. <i>(hangs up)</i> Okay. So we were talking about short people.
<p>David - No, <i>you</i> were talking about sock length. <i>(stands up)</i> See ya.
<p>Quinn - But you can't go! I haven't learned anything!
<p>David - Gee, and how do you propose to do that when you're on the phone through the whole session?
<p>Quinn - But they call, David, they call!
<p>David - Look, you seem bright enough, but I just can't sit here and listen to any more vacuous prattle with your brain-dead friends. Eyeliner, headband colors... God, are you boring.
<p>Quinn - I'm not boring! I'm popular!
<p>David - Hey, the only reason you're popular is your looks, and those won't last forever. You have nothing interesting to say and no intellectual curiosity whatsoever. Do the world a favor and don't go to college. Give up your spot to somebody who wants to learn.
<p><i>(Quinn gasps; it's obvious she's never been talked to like this before. At least, not by someone whose opinion mattered, on a subject she cared about.)</i>
<p>Quinn - But... you just said I was bright!
<p>David - So what? It doesn't matter, if you're hell-bent on achieving complete brain atrophy before you're old enough to vote.
<p>Quinn - I'm not!
<p>David - Do you even know what atrophy means?
<p>Quinn - David, my friends and I all got practically the same scores on our P-STATs.
<p>David - So?
<p>Quinn - So they were bad. And I know I can do better. It's not like I care or anything, it's just that I know I can.
<p>David - It's not like you care? It's not like you want to do better? Then why the hell am I here?
<p><i>(Quinn pauses for a moment to let that sink in. Finally, she comes to a decision as she places the phone in the middle of the table.)</i>
<p>Quinn - All right. I care. I want to do better.
<p>David - Okay, then... the Middle Ages.
<p><i>(David sits down and opens his textbook again as Quinn resigns herself to her situation.)</i>

<p><i>(Daria and Mr. DeMartino are seated together at the front of the bus, while Mr. O'Neill leads the other kids in song. Daria looks like she'd rather be anywhere else, while Mr. DeMartino looks like he wants to tear a hole in the side of the bus to escape.)</i>
<p>Mr. O'Neill and Kids - <i>(singing to "This Old Man")</i> "With a knickknack, gentle pat, give the dog a bone, this young person helps out at home."
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Now just the counselors. <i>(singing)</i> "This young person, he played..." <i>(sees the look on Daria's and Mr. DeMartino's faces)</i> Oh, dear.
<p><i>(at the camp, the kids are gathered in the activities room as Mr. O'Neill runs through his introduction)</i>
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Greetings, and welcome to the Okay to Cry Corral. I'm Uncle Timothy, and together, we're going to take a journey to the land of self-discovery. A land where it's okay to laugh, and it's okay... to cry.
<p>Daria - I feel like doing that now.
<p>Mr. O'Neill - And now, I'd like my co-counselors, Daria and Uncle Anthony, to say a few words about what they hope to accomplish here.
<p>Mr. DeMartino - After <b><i>you,</i></b> Daria.
<p>Daria - Thanks, Uncle Anthony. <i>(steps forward)</i> My goal is to get out of this unscathed. <i>(steps back)</i>
<p>Mr. DeMartino - I'm hoping to rediscover the <b><i>joys</i></b> and <b><i>satisfactions</i></b> of <b><i>teaching,</i></b> and the motives that led me to pursue such a <b><i>thankless...</i></b> I mean, <b><i>rewarding</i></b> profession in the first place. At least that's what my doctor says I need to do before I incur a cerebral <b><i>hemorrhage!</i></b>
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Uncle Anthony... <i>(chuckles nervously)</i> I mean, what are your goals for the campers?
<p>Mr. DeMartino - Oh. Um... <i>(pulls out a cue card)</i> "To help make this a <b><i>pleasurable</i></b> experience for all. Let's learn to love ourselves together."
<p><i>(pause)</i>
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Okay. <i>(chuckles nervously)</i> Let's divide into three groups, shall we? One, two, three. Daria, you take group one.
<p><i>(Daria approaches her group, which consists of four kids, one of whom is resting his head on his folded arms.)</i>
<p>Daria - Um... hello. Would, um, anyone like to say anything before we get started?
<p>Kid #1 - How come you're so pale?
<p>Kid #2 - Why do you bite your nails?
<p>Kid #3 - Do you ever smile?
<p>Daria - <i>(to the kid at the end)</i> Um, how about you? Would you like to say anything?
<p><i>(The kid, Link, slowly raises his head.)</i>
<p>Link - Is it fall yet?

<p><b><i>SCENE 16 - ASHFIELD COMMUNITY FOR THE ARTS</i></b>
<p><i>(Daniel Dotson, world famous artist -- in his mind -- is giving a lecture before the assembled residents of the art colony. Beside him is one of his works, four paper plates skewered by spears.)</i>
<p>Daniel - When I unveiled "Paper Plate Genocide" in 1991, it was hailed as intriguing, provocative, even brilliant. And not just by me.
<p><i>(scattered laughter)</i>
<p>Daniel - No, we all know critics tend to get carried away. But what was I thinking when I created a work that seems to have turned out both seminal and semiotic?
<p>Jane - "I can't believe I'm getting away with this?"
<p><i>(Sitting beside her, a young woman with tatoos on her arms and long, dark hair -- Alison -- glances over at Jane and smirks; she obviously appreciates Jane's sarcastic remark.)</i>
<p>Paris - Excuse me, Mr. Dotson?
<p>Daniel - Please... Paris, isn't it? Call me Daniel.
<p>Paris - Daniel. I just want to say, I think you're the greatest living artist of our time.
<p>Jane - "And not just because I have no taste."
<p><i>(Everyone except Jane and Alison applaud.)</i>
<p>Guy - I was wondering, where do you get your inspiration?
<p>Alison - "My alimony bills."
<p><i>(This time, it's Jane's turn to look impressed. She and Alison exchange a look that needs no translation: they're on the same wavelength regarding this full-of-himself poseur.)</i>
<p>Daniel - I don't sit around and wait for inspiration. I grab it -- in the glint of the sun on a frozen peak... in the pain of an arthritic's hobble... <font color="#ff0000"><b>in a lover's whisper in the dark.</b></font> So I'd have to say, my inspiration comes from life itself.
<p>Guy - Wow.
<p><i>(Now Jane and Alison are frowning. If anything, their hatred of this clown is getting deeper, if that's possible.)</i>
<p>Daniel - Well, that's enough of the old windbag's ramblings for today. We'll pick up here tomorrow.
<p><i>(The other students sigh with disappointment, then applaud as Daniel leaves.)</i>
<p>Alison - Hi. I'm Alison.
<p>Jane - Jane.
<p><i>(They shake hands.)</i>
<p>Alison - Our Mr. Dotson's really something, isn't he?
<p>Jane - Well, he certainly doesn't let substance get in the way of self-congratulatory yap.
<p>Alison - At least we'll never have to worry about him intimidating us with his talent.
<p><i>(Jane lets out a small smile, thinking that this place might not be so bad after all.)</i>

<p>Girl #1 - Ring the bell!
<p>Sam - Give me a fudge bar!

<p>Jodie - Sounds like you're having as good a day as I am.
<p>Mack - Well, things are looking up now. Want to do something later?
<p>Jodie - I can't. I'm gonna be stuffing envelopes all night. But I'll see you at my family's Fourth of July party, right?
<p>Mack - Right. Unless I... <i>(loudly)</i> shove an ice cream scooper down someone's throat first!

<p><b><i>SCENE 18 - THE SLOANE HOUSE</i></b>
<p><i>(Tom and Daria are watching television.)</i>
<p>SSW Announcer - Are drug-crazed rodents raiding your child's medicine cabinet? "Rats on Ritalin," next on <i>Sick, Sad World.</i>
<p>Tom - Maybe you should get some of that for the little campers.
<p>Daria - Ritalin or the rats?
<p><i>(Kay and Elsie enter the room. Elsie sits on the chair opposite the couch where Tom and Daria are sitting. Elsie is carrying a garment bag, which she unceremoniously dumps on the ottoman.)</i>
<p>Kay - Hello, Daria. It's nice to see you again.
<p>Daria - Um, you, too, Mrs. Sloane. Hi, Elsie.
<p>Kay - Elsie, why don't you show Tom and Daria the dress Richard made you for the Starry Night Ball?
<p>Elsie - Oh, I couldn't ruin the surprise.
<p>Kay - Daria, is there any way I can change your mind about going? Then you and I could gang up and convince Tom.
<p>Daria - Um...
<p>Tom - Sorry, I forgot to tell you. Mom's on the board of the Lawndale Art Museum. They're holding a benefit to raise money for a new wet bar.
<p>Kay - A new gallery. It should be a lot of fun.
<p>Daria - Um, sounds like it.
<p>Elsie - If you like watching ice sculptures melt.
<p>Tom - Actually, these things are excruciatingly dull and stuffy, and I told her there's no way we're going.
<p>Daria - Well, um, I guess that's right.
<p>Elsie - You wouldn't want to compromise your quasi-rebelliousness.
<p>Tom - I hope Richard left enough room in that dress for your faux jadedness.
<p>Kay - Children! You know, Daria, this event is not members-only. I'd love to send your parents an invitation if you think they'd be interested.
<p>Daria - Um... thanks.
<p>Elsie - Are you going to blow off fireworks at the club, too?
<p>Tom - Sorry. I forgot. We can't. I already told... <i>promised</i> Daria I'd go with her to her friend's Fourth of July party.
<p>Kay - Daria, what can we do to get into your good graces?

<p><b><i>SCENE 19 - THE "OKAY TO CRY CORRAL"</i></b>
<p><i>(The kids are in the activities room. They're not happy.)</i>
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Now, I want each of you to think of the blue lanyard as representing how you feel on the inside, and the green as how you present yourself on the outside. Picture...
<p>Kristin - It's a hundred degrees! Can't we go for a swim in the lake?
<p>Kids - Yeah... lake!
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Now, Kristin... do we really want to risk exposure to algae blooms? Maybe some other time, when it's not quite as warm out.
<p><i>(kids groan)</i>
<p>Mr. DeMartino - The <b><i>blue</i></b> strand represents the <b><i>gnawing</i></b> feeling of <b><i>failure</i></b> growing with each wasted year. The green represents the <b><i>ulcer</i></b> you're developing from the unrelenting <b><i>indignities</i></b> you suffer. Take the blue and cross it under... I mean, <b><i>over</i></b> the loop and then through the <b><i>frustration...</i></b> argh...! Lanyards suck!
<p><i>(DeMartino gets up and walks away, leaving the kids confused)</i>
<p>Daria - So continue threading the blue with the green until you've finished. Or can't take the tedium anymore.
<p><i>(She picks up a book and lets the kids continue with the project. Eventually, Link gets up and walks over to her.)</i>
<p>Daria - Hey, Link. Need some help?
<p>Link - Nope. All done.
<p><i>(Link tosses his project on the table and leaves. Daria picks it up and examines it: it's a twisted, gnarled mess. Link is obviously <i>not</i> having a good time.)</i>

<p><b><i>SCENE 20 - THE LANDON HOUSE</i></b>
<p><i>(The Landon's Fourth of July party is in full swing, with influential guests and various students from Lawndale High in attendance. The Three J's approach Quinn and the Fashion Club, who are standing off to one side of the Landon's deck.)</i>
<p>Joey - Hey, Quinn, can I get you a soda?
<p>Jeffy - How about a lemon for your soda?
<p>Jamie - How about a knife for your lemon?
<p>Quinn - Um, okay. <i>(she watches the J's scramble away to fulfill her wishes)</i>
<p>Sandi - Gee, Quinn... I'm surprised you're not at the planetarium with the jet propulsion club, what with all your tutoring.
<p>Quinn - Sandi, shh. I'm trying to keep that a little quiet, remember?
<p>Sandi - Say no more. As your friend and fellow Fashion Club officer, I give you my solemn word that your secret is safe with me.
<p>Quinn - Thanks, Sandi.
<p><i>(the Three J's return)</i>
<p>Sandi - I will never tell a soul that you, Quinn Morgendorffer, are seeing a tutor.
<p>Jamie - Quinn... you're seeing a tutor?
<p>Sandi - Quinn, I'm so sorry. I didn't see them sneaking up behind you.
<p>Quinn - Um, yeah... I'm being tutored because of my P-STAT scores.
<p>Joey - That's cool.
<p>Jeffy - Hey, yeah.
<p>Jamie - Awesome.
<p>Quinn - Really?
<p>Jamie - Hey, next year could you help me with my homework?
<p>Joey - No, me! I'm stupider than he is.
<p>Jeffy - I can barely spell my own name.
<p><i>(As the Three J's continue arguing, Sandi gives Quinn a dirty look; obviously, her little plan has backfired on her.)</i>
<p>Sandi - Gee, I didn't realize being tutored provides you with an opportunity to help others. Maybe I should get a tutor.
<p>Tiffany - Yeah... me, too.
<p>Stacy - Oh, God, I think I need one, too.
<p><i>(On the other side of the deck, Jodie, her father Andrew, and Mack are talking with another couple, presumably friends of Andrew's, or possibly a client.)</i>
<p>Woman - Jodie, what have you been up to this summer?
<p>Jodie - <i>(totally unenthusiastic)</i> Soup kitchen, crisis center, Congressman Sack's office, fund raising, golf lessons.
<p>Andrew - Isn't she something?
<p>Man - Oh, yes. And Michael, is it? What are you doing this summer?
<p>Mack - Driving an ice cream truck.
<p>Woman - Oh.
<p><i>(Down on the lawn, Daria and Tom are standing next to the deck, while Kevin and Brittany are sitting on the stairs.)</i>
<p>Kevin - Hey, there's Daria with that guy who claims to be her brother. I'm going to trap him in his own web of lies.
<p>Brittany - Oh, Kevin, you're so... spidery!
<p>Daria - It's been a lovely evening, but I think I'm ready to go home now. <i>(sees Kevin and Brittany approaching)</i> But first, a word from the village idiots.
<p>Brittany - Hi, Daria! Hi, Tom!
<p>Daria - Hey.
<p>Tom - Hi.
<p>Kevin - Say there, um, Tom. If you're Daria's brother, how come we never saw you before this year?
<p>Tom - That should be obvious. They weren't able to match up our telltale birthmarks until now.
<p>Kevin - Oh. Hey, man, I'm sorry.
<p>Daria - I have something to tell you two. Tom's not my brother.
<p>Kevin - Aha!
<p>Daria - He's the mad scientist who built me. He has to hang around in case my internal organs fall out.
<p>Brittany - Eww...!
<p>Tom - I'm her date.
<p>Kevin - <i>(laughs)</i> Good one, man.
<p>Brittany - Wait a minute, Kevvy. He's serious. But how can you be dating Jane <i>and</i> Daria?
<p>Tom - Well, I'm not dating Jane anymore.
<p>Brittany - Oh. <i>(pause)</i> Oh! Daria!
<p>Daria - Um, will you excuse us for a while? We'll be back right after man walks on the sun. <i>(she takes Tom's arm and drags him away)</i>
<p>Brittany - Wow... Daria's dating her best friend's boyfriend.
<p>Kevin - So then, whose brother is he?
<p><i>(Brittany frowns at Kevin, whose stupidity is exceeded by nothing)</i>
<p><i>(Jodie walks down the stairs to the lawn just as Daria and Tom approach)</i>
<p>Jodie - Hey, Daria. Thanks for coming. Tom Sloane, right? Jane's boyfriend?
<p>Tom - Actually, we're just friends now.
<p>Jodie - Oh, that's too bad. You guys were a cute couple. Any chance for a reconciliation?
<p>Daria - Um, Jodie... Hell's frozen over and Tom's here with me.
<p>Jodie - What? I mean... it didn't occur to me that, um... you know... <i>(Andrew joins them)</i> Dad! You remember Daria Morgendorffer. And this is Tom Sloane.
<p>Andrew - Sloane? You're not Angier's boy, are you?
<p>Tom - As a matter of fact, yeah.
<p>Andrew - Great guy. And how's your lovely mother, Katherine?
<p>Tom - You know my mother?
<p>Andrew - I just had the pleasure. We're up for membership at Winged Tree and she's on the board. Forget politics. <i>That's</i> power. <i>(laughs)</i>
<p><i>(Tom simply stands there, unsure of how to respond. Daria and Jodie, however, know exactly how: they're embarrassed.)</i>

<p><b><i>SCENE 21 - ASHFIELD COMMUNITY FOR THE ARTS</i></b>
<p><i>(Jane and Alison enter the dining room. Each is carrying a tray of food.)</i>
<p>Jane - I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
<p>Alison - You can't eat in your room forever. Why go to an artists' colony if you're not going to mingle with your fellow artists?
<p>Jane - That's like saying why go to a penal colony if you're not going to mingle with your fellow... I think I'll stop there.
<p>Alison - Come on, I know they'll warm up to you if you give them a chance.
<p>Jane - Um, are we by any chance conversing across parallel dimensions?
<p>Alison - I'll bet you dinner I'm right.
<p>Jane - You're on, sucker.
<p><i>(The girls approach the table where Paris, Jet, and some unidentified guy are sitting.)</i>
<p>Alison - Mind if we join you?
<p>Jet - Not at all.
<p>Alison - How's everyone liking the colony so far?
<p>Jet - I love it. It's so... freeing.
<p>Paris - And Daniel? That man is brilliant. He said my white-on-white painting was a stroke of inspiration.
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Guy - I'll bet you two have explored all sorts of strokes together.
<p><i>(Jet laughs)</i>
<p>Man - Oh well, I suppose genius does have its prerogatives.

<p>Paris - No offense, Jane, but aren't you still in high school? How much can you know about art at this point?
<p>Jane - Excuse me?
<p>Alison - Paris, we all had to submit a portfolio to be accepted here. I'd say Jane knows quite a bit about art.
<p>Paris - I'm sure you're right. I apologize. Are you guys ready to go?
<p><i>(the three bid their goodbyes to Jane and Alison as they get up and leave)</i>
<p>Jane - Gee, that was fun. But in the future, let's save time and just roll around on gravel.
<p>Alison - Sorry about that. I guess I owe you one.
<p>Jane - You owe me dinner.

<p>Kids - <i>(singing halfheartedly)</i> "Brush, brush, brush your teeth, using good hygiene, up and down and up and down, floss until they gleam."
<p><i>(Daria, meanwhile, can't hear a thing; she's wearing a pair of those earmuffs used by airport employees who work around jet engines. Mr. DeMartino, however, has no such protection, and is barely keeping himself from going postal.)</i>
<p><i>(Later, at the camp, the kids are painting in the activity room.)</i>
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Remember, don't think about what you're doing, because I don't really want a painting from you. I want a painting from the child within.
<p>Girl - It's so pretty out. Can't we go for a hike? Please?
<p><i>(the other kids join in and also plead to go outside)</i>
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Now, campers. I wouldn't be a very caring counselor if I let you run higgledy-piggledy through the poison ivy and ticks. One day there'll be time to explore the woods, after we explore ourselves.
<p><i>(all the kids sigh)</i>
<p>Mr. DeMartino - Well, well, Josh. What have we <b><i>here?</i></b> A football player? May I inquire <b><i>why?</i></b>
<p>Josh - My child within wants to be a winner. Everyone knows football players are winners.
<p>Mr. DeMartino - I see. Obviously, your definition of a winner is a degenerate <b><i>slacker</i></b> with pigskin for <b><i>brains,</i></b> an <b><i>unshakable</i></b> desire to <b><i>sleep</i></b> through class, and a lifetime goal of excelling at <b><i>arm noise</i></b> contests while <b><i>never, ever</i></b> doing any honest work of <b><i>any kind!</i></b> Is that <b><i>right?!</i></b>
<p><i>(Josh starts crying and runs away)</i>
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Oh, my gosh. Anthony, what happened?
<p>Mr. DeMartino - I, uh... Timothy, I think I may have spoken too <b><i>harshly</i></b> to a camper.
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Oh, no. Was he traumatized?
<p>Mr. DeMartino - I'm no <b><i>good</i></b> at working with young people! Why, oh, <b><i>why</i></b> did I ever think I could?

<p>David - Sandi, if you're not going to take this seriously...
<p>Sandi - Are you implying that I can't shop <i>and</i> give you my attention? Because I don't think that's the sort of confidence-building a tutor is supposed to provide his student.
<p>David - <i>(frustrated)</i> We're not going to the mall.

<p>Mr. O'Neill - Oh, well, that certainly sounds like something we can talk about...
<p>Link - I don't <i>want</i> to talk about it. I want to go to a <i>real</i> camp where you run around all day doing stuff until you're too tired to think. Can we do that, "Uncle Timothy"?
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Well, you see, Link, much as I'd like to, we have to keep the other children's safety in mind.
<p>Link - <i>(stands)</i> That's what I thought. You don't <i>really</i> care about making kids feel better.
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Of course I do!
<p>Link - Okay, then I guess the problem is just that you suck at it. <i>(slams the door as he walks out)</i>

<p>Helen - The Starry Night Ball? What a wonderful idea. Without the arts, what distinguishes us from animals, right?
<p>Daria - Well, let's see. Animals don't feel the need to suck up to wealthier animals.

<p>Daria - No.
<p>Tom - Come on. I had to beg you to come out tonight, and then the first thing you do is jump down my throat. What's going on?
<p>Daria - I don't know. It's the museum. And the country club. And your family. You know, your whole elitist world.
<p>Tom - It's not elitist. And it's not <i>my</i> world.
<p>Daria - Don't tell me. Tell Aunt Mildred tomorrow when you get to your private island. And be sure not to mention <i>me</i> to her, okay?
<p>Tom - What?
<p>Daria - It's obvious you don't want me mixing with your family, since you didn't ask me to the fund-raiser or the fireworks display.
<p>Tom - Daria, I didn't invite you to those things because I sure as hell didn't want to go and I assumed you wouldn't either. Right?
<p>Daria - Well, you still should have asked.
<p>Tom - You're right.
<p>Daria - Unless you just assumed your parents were gonna hate me.
<p>Tom - What? What are you talking about? My parents think you're great. They know you're really smart and headed for college and stuff. It's not like you're Jane.
<p>Daria - What do you mean, "not like I'm Jane?" Jane's smart.
<p>Tom - <i>(oops!)</i> Yeah, <i>I</i> know she's smart. But she could get a Ph.D or spend the rest of her days painting tiles, and her parents wouldn't care either way. If <i>we</i> did that, our parents would have a fit.
<p>Daria - So what you're saying is Jane isn't up to your family's standards. God, you're a snob.
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Tom - Damn it, Daria! Quit trying to pick a fight with me!
<p>Daria - Excuse me?</b></font>
<p>Tom - You attack my mother for inviting your parents to the fund-raiser, then attack me for not inviting you. You say my family disapproves of you, I say they relate to you better than Jane, and now I'm a snob.
<p>Daria - Forgive me for being a loyal friend.
<p>Tom - Why don't you say what you're <i>really</i> afraid of? The idea that you might actually start caring about someone. 'Cause that would make you vulnerable.
<p>Daria - Look, maybe we just jumped into this dating stuff too fast. Maybe we need to take a break.
<p>Tom - A break? From <i>what?</i> We haven't <i>done</i> anything! Come on, Daria! <i>(Daria doesn't respond)</i> I don't believe this. <i>(still nothing)</i> Well, I'm not going to stand here and beg. <i>(nope, nothing)</i> Fine.

<p>Quinn - Oh, Sandi, I just wish I were as smart as you so I wouldn't need a tutor. You know, David's kind of funny.
<p>Sandi - If by funny you mean extraordinarily unpleasant, I agree completely. That's why I was forced to terminate his services.

<p>Quinn - No reason. Do you think he's... cute?
<p>Daria - Well, I suppose in that not-a-brain-dead-surfer kind of way.
<p>Quinn - Yeah...
<p>Daria - I know you may find this hard to believe, but looks aren't everything.

<p>Ms. Li - <i>(over P.A.)</i> Welcome back, students, and remember, the school nurse is in and ready to take your voluntary urine sample. Show your Lawndale High spirit with the gift of urine! <i>(P.A. clicks off)</i>
<p>Fashion Club - Eww...!</b></font>
<p><i>(later, in Mr. DeMartino's class)</i>
<p>Mr. DeMartino - All right, which of you <b><i>promising young people</i></b> would like to share your definition of <b><i>Manifest Destiny?</i></b>
<p><i>(Quinn raises her hand, then lowers it at a look from Sandi. She hesitates only a moment, though, then confidently raises her hand again.)</i>
<p>Mr. DeMartino - Ms. Morgendorffer? Did you want something?
<p>Quinn - "Manifest Destiny" was a phrase politicians used to say that God wanted the U.S. to keep expanding west all the way to the Pacific ocean. Because why bother owning the country if Hollywood wasn't included?
<p>Mr. DeMartino - Ahh, Quinn, that's <b><i>very</i></b> good! <b><i>Thank</i></b> you for making my day rewarding.
<p><i>(class starts to murmur amongst themselves; up until now, Quinn has never shown she has a functioning brain)</i>
<p>Sandi - Gee, Quinn... I hope that little foray of yours into Geekland just now is the result of heat exhaustion, and not an unpleasant side effect of all that tutoring. I mean, you're not turning into a brain, are you?
<p>Quinn - <i>(undeterred)</i> Sandi, just because someone can answer a simple question doesn't mean they're a pedagogue.
<p><i>(Sandi wants to respond, but can't: she doesn't know what Quinn said, which brings a smile to Quinn's lips.)</i>

<p><b><i>SCENE 50 - LAWNDALE STREET</i></b>
<p><i>(Daria and Jane are walking home from school)</i>
<p>Daria - So, I guess I got through to Link after all, and all it cost me was a generous period of self-doubt followed by a bracing stint of self-hatred.
<p>Jane - See? Not every human is a manipulative, opportunistic letch, or at least that's what I'm told.
<p>Daria - You didn't make <i>any</i> friends at that art colony, did you?
<p>Jane - Nope. <font color="#ff0000"><b>Well, except this one girl, until she got fresh.</b></font>
<p><i>(that one brings Daria to a halt)</i>
<p>Daria - You're not kidding.
<p>Jane - <font color="#ff0000"><b>As much as I'd like to gain your sour perspective on the whole sordid incident, it's gonna have to wait.</b></font> I think someone's looking for you.
<p><i>(Tom pulls alongside Daria and Jane in his new Rustmobile)</i>
<p>Jane - Whoa! Nice car. Where's Jeeves?
<p>Tom - I killed him for his uniform. How are you doing?
<p>Jane - I'm okay. <i>(inclines her head in Daria's direction)</i> She's pretty okay, too.
<p>Tom - Yeah, I know that. Hey, Daria.
<p>Daria - Hey.
<p>Tom - Want to go for a ride?
<p>Daria - Actually, we were just...
<p>Jane - ...saying good-bye. I'll call you later. <i>(leaves)</i>
<p><i>(Tom opens the passenger door for Daria, and they drive away. When they reach the Morgendorffer house, he pulls in front and stops the engine.)</i>
<p>Daria - Thanks for the lift. Um, I guess I should be going. <i>(starts to leave)</i>
<p>Tom - Just hear me out. Okay?
<p>Daria - Sure. <i>(quickly settles back into the seat)</i>
<p>Tom - There's nothing I can do about the club, my family, the whole thing. And yes, I can see where all of that could make you uncomfortable.
<p>Daria - Thank you.
<p>Tom - But would you also agree that maybe I was right when I said this dating stuff is new to you, and you're afraid of getting hurt, and maybe you were looking for an out before you got too pulled in? <i>(pause)</i> Daria?
<p>Daria - Maybe some of that's true.
<p>Tom - Well, here's the deal. I want to start seeing you again. We can take it slow, but you've got to at least try to trust me. I really like you, Daria, but I don't want to waste any more time if you're not going to give it a chance. <i>(pause)</i> Please?
<p><i>(Daria mumbles)</i>
<p>Tom - Daria...?
<p>Daria - I want to try again, too.
<p>Tom - Don't say any more. I hate it when you get all mushy.
<p>Daria - Yeah, I don't like it, either. Okay, then, I'm glad. See ya.
<p><i>(Daria gets out of the car, and just as Tom prepares to pull away, she jumps back in and they kiss... all of which is observed by Helen through the bay window of the house.)</i>
<p>Helen - Oh, Jakey, do you realize what a momentous summer our girls have had? Quinn learned she's smarter than she thought, and Daria has her first boyfriend.
<p>Jake - It's summer already?
<p>Helen - <i>(exasperated)</i> Jake...
<p><i>(Jake turns around, revealing the mischievous grin on his face. He finally made a joke!)</i>
<p>Helen - You made a joke, didn't you?
<p>Jake - Yep! Old Jake was joking!
<p>Helen - I like a man with a sense of humor.
<p>Jake - <i>(seductively)</i> Why'd the chicken cross the road?
<p>Helen - I don't know.
<p>Jake - Well, you're about to find out!
<p>Helen - Oh!
<p><i>(Helen starts laughing and whooping as Jake begins to tease her and chase her around the living room. Outside, the sun slowly sets behind Daria and Tom, and on an eventful summer in Lawndale.)</i>
