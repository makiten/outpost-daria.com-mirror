      "Look Back In Annoyance" was a half-hour retrospective of the series (or, as Daria so charmingly put it, "a cheap-ass clip show"). Hosted by Daria and Jane, it aired a week before the premiere of "Is It College Yet?", the TV movie that served as the series finale.<br>

<p>Daria - Hello. I am beloved on-air personality Daria Morgendorffer.
<p>Jane - <i>Et</i> Jane Lane, <i>c'est moi</i>.
<p>Daria - Your hosts for a fascinating <i>Daria</i> retrospective we call "Look Back In Annoyance."
<p>Jane - Five years' worth of special moments from a special series. A journey to places found not on the globe, but on a map of the human heart.
<p>Daria - In other words, a cheap-ass clip show.
<p><i>(theme music)</i>

<p>Jane - Oops. Um, speaking of siblings, let's take a look at the warm relationship between Daria and Quinn. Innocent, inexperienced Daria and Quinn.
<p>Daria - I'm going to tell them about you and Vince Neil.

<p>Jane - It's hard to believe you two are from the same household.
<p>Daria - Or the same species.
<p>Jane - Perhaps the clues to your aberrant interaction paradigm with your sister can be found by observing your overall family dynamic.
<p>Daria - Huh?

<p>Jane - Oh, Daria, how do you come up with your clever one-liners?
<p>Daria - I start out with clever two-liners and then I cut them in half.
<p>Jane - Let's take a look at some of Daria's vintage wisecracks. The show wouldn't be the same without them.
<p>Daria - No. It would be shorter.
<p>Jane - All right already. Yeesh!

<p>Jane - Debuting January 21st at 8 P.M. Eastern and featuring the premiere of a brand-new video by Garbage. Now sit back, relax, and for God's sake, don't blink.

<p>Daria - Well, there it is. Five years of laughs, tears and incredibly inexpensive animation boiled down to a single half hour.
<p>Jane - With ten minutes to spare for commercials. <i>(sarcastic)</i> Thanks for the time, MTV.
<p>Daria - And thank you, viewers, for sticking with us through it all. Now we've got to clear out and make room for something that better fits the schedule.
<p>Jane - You know, "MTV Presents 'Kids Talking About Sex... <i>During</i> Sex!'"

<p>Jane - Toodle-oo!
