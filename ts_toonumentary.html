      MTV's "Toonumentary," a documentary of MTV's foray into animation and the
      formation of MTV Animation, was shown during MTV's Weird-Ass Cartoon Weekend
      in 1998. Several of MTV's well-known animation series were featured,
      including <i>Aeon Flux, MTV Oddities, Beavis and Butt-head</i>... and, of
      course, <i>Daria.</i> The following is a transcript of the short segment
      devoted to <i>Daria,</i> with comments from executive producers Glenn
      Eichler and Susie Lewis.

<p>Kurt Loeder - It was time for MTV Animation to rise from the primordial sludge of male fantasy and try something different... something for the girls. <i>Daria,</i> the brilliant former classmate of <i>Beavis and Butt-head,</i> was a huge hit series. The critics called it "smart," "sophisticated," "tasteful" and "grown-up"... but viewers watched it anyway.
<p>Glenn Eichler - Daria's cool because she says what she's thinking.
<p><i>(scene from "Cafe Disaffecto")</i>
<p>Mr. O'Neill - Let's all pledge to make Daria's dream a reality!
<p>Daria - You mean, the one where people walking down the street burst into flames?
<p><i>(end scene)</i>
<p>Eichler - She doesn't say what she thinks other people want to hear her say. She's not afraid to be herself even though it costs her in popularity, and that's sort of the attitude that we have about the show, too. We weren't afraid to do what we wanted to do, and if it turned out to be unpopular, that's the way it goes. Of course, we all know now it's a huge smash, but we had no way of knowing that then.
<p><i>(scene from "Cafe Disaffecto")</i>
<p>Daria - (hums "Pop Goes the Weasel")
<p><i>(end scene)</i>
<p>Susie Lewis - It's based on common feelings that people feel in high school: the insecurity, how people just say things and they hurt each other without realizing it. And that's something that everyone can identify with.
<p><i>(scene from "College Bored")</i>
<p>(Daria daydreaming)
<p>Professor - Daria, I know it's only the first week of freshman year, but I wonder if you'd consider transferring to the graduate school?
<p>Daria - I'm not really sure I want to be a professional student.
<p>Professor - But I don't want you to study. I want you to teach.
<p>Daria - Well...
<p>Professor - Not here, of course. On our Paris campus.
<p>Daria - Oh! Okay.
<p>Professor - Superb! Now I can use your dorm room to carry on affairs with some of the more beautiful undergraduates! Thank you!
<p>Daria - How come even in my fantasies everyone's a jerk?
<p><i>(end scene)</i>
<p>Eichler - We don't have 800 people screwing around with the script and it ends up being an episode of <i>Moesha.</i> That is very rare.
<p><i>(scene from "Cafe Disaffecto")</i>
<p>Daria - But we've got to maintain constant vigilance against those who would manipulate us into actions we'd never take on our own.
<p>Jake - I'll say!
