              <li>Removed the <i>Daria</i> theme song files from the Computer Add-Ons page as an "anti-Foxing" measure.
              <li>The message board, and the song list and "oops!" list submission forms, are currently unavailable, since the new server I'm on doesn't support MIVA. (It <i>does</i> support CGI-BIN, however, thus I'm currently looking into new message board software and replacement submission form scripts.)

            <i>The first update of the New Millennium... and yes, I still say to all of you "2001 is the official start" maniacs: lighten up, okay? :-)<br>
            <br>
            Also, I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome fanfic authors Diane Long and Admonisher to the ranks of Featured Authors (and I'll admit, it's long overdue). Congratulations, Diane and John! You can put those 'maters down now... &lt;grin&gt;<br>
            <br>
            Finally, I know that this isn't much of an update -- more fanfic, and the ever-present artwork, is waiting in the wings -- but I promise to have more online when I get back from my trip. Viva Las Vegas!</i><br>
