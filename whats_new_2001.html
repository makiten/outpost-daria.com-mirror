            <br>
            <i>However, I </i>do<i> have a new treat for you: "general" fanfics are now available sorted by author as well as title! Have a look at the revamped Fan Fiction page for the details. I've come up with a new process for handling fanfic that makes updating trivial, so all new fanfics will be listed sorted both ways. (Yaaay!!!!)</i><br>
            <br>
            <i>In a future update, I hope to offer the ability for authors to upload their stories to the Outpost Daria web space via web browser (ala FanFiction.Net), as an alternative to e-mail attachments. The stories themselves won't go online immediately, of course, but this should take some of the hassle out of submitting stories for a lot of people.</i><br>

The fanfic section will get its first major overhaul in quite a while with the addition of index pages sorted by author, in addition to the pages sorted by title. This should help immensely finding stories by a particular author, so that you don't have to wade through all A-Z pages plus the Featured Author and Series pages.
