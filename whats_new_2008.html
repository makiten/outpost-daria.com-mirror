      Get into the spirit of All Hallow's Eve with our collection of <a href="halloween_fanfic.html">Halloween-themed fanfic</a>... some horror, some supernatural, some humor, but all Daria! Now, normally I'd also whip up a special page of holiday-themed artwork, until I realized that <a href="art_gallery.html">the Art Gallery page</a> -- specifically, the Character Makeovers section -- provides you with all the artwork you'd like of our favorite characters dressed in outlandish costumes. Enjoy!<br>
      <br>
      I've updated the <a href="fanfic_submission_rules.html">fanfic submission rules</a> to indicate that I will not accept links to stories on sites like FanFiction.net. These sites may have (or do have) restrictions in their Terms of Use policies that prohibit outside linking; even if they don't, I know I'd be a little miffed if someone used OD as an extension of their own website's storage space. It's... well, it's just plain <i>rude</i>. I'd rather be a good neighbor, and play nice with the other kids...<br>
      <br>
      One last item: be sure to check out the <a href="news.html">news page</a> for the skinny about <i>Daria</i> creator Glenn Eichler... specifically, how he got his shiny new mantleplace trinket. :-)<br>

      Note that two of the stories in this update were supposed to be included
      in the June update, but were omitted due to lack of time (more
      specifically, the lack of time to hunt down the correct URLs for the
      stories). Lesson for submitters: double-check any links you provide to
      your material. The life (or, rather, submission) you save could be your
      own. :-)<br>

      There were no May or June updates because I'd only received a couple of
      submissions since the April update went up. However, begging like a
      starving dog appears to have rectified that situation somewhat. :-)<br>
      <br>
      Just a reminder to fanfic authors: when submitting stories, please let
      me know if you want your e-mail address posted; otherwise, it won't be.
      Also, don't forget to include a short description of your story (and if
      your story is part of a series, also include a description of the series
      itself). Failing to supply descriptions will get your stories listed
      with "(no description given)."<br>

      The quote from Michael Corelone on the home page pretty much says it
      all. I just couldn't stay away! (The 10-month retirement did help to
      recharge my batteries.) OD will now officially be on a once-per-month
      update schedule, though, with the goal of updating on the first weekend
      of the month... and I do reserve the right to some "wiggle room."
      :-)<br>
      <br>
      (In fact, this update would've been online sooner, had it not been for
      the fact that I was dealing with <i>another</i> health crisis. This
      time, it was an infected cut on my leg that wouldn't heal&mdash;thank
      you <i>so</i> very much, Mr. Diabetes&mdash;that required nearly four
      weeks of IV antibiotics to get rid of the staph bacteria. You know, the
      bacteria they talk about all the time on TV, usually in the same
      sentence with the word "death"? I tell you, when I go for the drama, I
      don't do it in half-measures. *sigh*)<br>
      <br>
      There's still some work to be done, so don't mind
      the sawdust on the floor...<br>
