      Thanksgiving's here, for those of us in the States, and as you saw on
      the home page, Helen's channeling her inner Julia Child to cook up a
      holiday bird. Let's hope that Jake doesn't decide to contribute Kitchen
      Sink Stew...<br>

      The shutdown of longtime (and infamous) web hosting service Geocities
      would normally be a cause for celebration (there's a reason it was often
      referred to as "Geoshitty"), were it not for the fact that its departure
      has left quite a few orphaned <i>Daria</i>-related items, mainly fanfic.
      I've retrieved as many of them as I could using the Wayback Machine and
      have hosted them locally, but sadly, there were some items that simply
      could not be retrieved and are now lost forever.<br>

      Well, my bariatric surgery is on hold until this infection in my foot is knocked out. Thankfully, it's looking a lot better, and seems to be healing nicely, so I'm hopeful that this will happen some time within the next couple of months. (I'd like to get this done before the cold weather sets in.) I'll keep you posted.<br>

      Oh, one more thing: I've updated the "<i>Daria</i> on DVD"-related areas with the latest info (short version: DVDs still on track for fall 2010).<br>

      This may be the last update for a while, as I am scheduled to undergo bariatric surgery on July 29th. I'll be laid up, then concentrating on getting back on normal food, throughout August and much of September. But please, don't hesitate to send any fanfic, artwork, or other submissions; I'll store 'em and get to 'em when I can.<br>
      <br>
      (For those who are curious, the procedure I'm having is a new one called a "sleeve gastrectomy." It basically separates and seals off 85% of my stomach, leaving a small, banana-shaped pouch behind, with the intent being to restrict the amount of food I can eat. Combined with a healthy diet and exercise, I expect to lose quite a bit of weight, with my goal being to drop at least 200 pounds over the next year. I'm also hopeful that many of these health issues -- diabetes, high blood pressure, and the problems associated with both -- will also go away, giving me a good shot at living to see my 50th birthday.)<br>

      Okay, the sight of Mr. DeMartino in full <i>American Beauty</i> glory is enough to make you dig your eyes out with a rusty spork, but it was the only Valentine's Day-related alter-ego I had (forgive me, please, I beg you!). A much more pleasant image can be found <a href="artwork/sc/valentines.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>, courtesy of S.C.

      Finally, a sad note: Martin Sylvester reports that his site, The Irony Maiden, is no more. Its demise hits the international <i>Daria</i> community hard, as it was the place to go for <i>Daria</i> information outside the USA. Until/unless the Padre can resurrect it (no pun intended), I'll take the opportunity to thank him for providing a great resource for all these many years. It'll be missed!<br>
