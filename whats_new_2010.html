      Well, here we are, the end of another interesting year. Sorry I didn't get this out by Christmas, but thankfully, a last-minute flurry of submissions allowed me to make one final, year-end update. Enjoy, and here's to what will hopefully be a better year in 2011!<br>

      Yup, it's that time once again, so check out our collection of <a href="halloween_fanfic.html">Halloween-themed fanfic</a>... some horror, some supernatural, some humor, but all <i>Daria</i>! And, as always, <a href="art_gallery.html">the Art Gallery page</a> (specifically, the Character Makeovers section) has plenty of artwork showing our favorite characters in costumes they wouldn't be caught dead wearing. Also, as you can see, there's a ton of new fanfic in this month's update, thanks mostly to the prolific Smileyfax and Brother Grimace. Enjoy, all!<br>

      More site maintenance/overhauls, plus another review (from Film Freak Central) added to the <a href="daria_the_complete_series_dvd.html"><i>Daria: The Complete Animated Series</i></a> page.<br>
      <br>
      On a personal note, I'm feeling good after my surgery (see last month's update notes). I've already lost more than 70 pounds, and things are progressing well. I can certainly tell the difference, especially with my clothes (which now feel like they're circus tents), and I'm not tired and worn out all the time like I used to be. Still a long way to go, but I'm getting there!<br>

      By the time you read this, I'll have undergone weight loss surgery (the one I was supposed to have had last year unti a MRSA infection put the kibbosh on it). I'm looking forward to dropping pounds and, hopefully, ridding myself of many of the health issues associated with my obesity (diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep apnea, etc.). But, that's not why you're here, so enjoy this update while I recuperate (and dream of eating solid food again)!<br>
      <br>
      <b>NOTE:</b> One major change to the site involves the five current major fanfic shared fanfic (<i>Daylight, Judith Strikes!, Legion of Lawndale Heroes, Shining Star,</i> and <i>Tales of the Ringbearers</i>): they have been consolidated onto a single page called <a href="fanfic_series_multiverse.html">The Daria Multiverse</a>. Each shared universe section includes a short description and a link to its page at <a href="http://www.dariawiki.org/" target="_blank">The Daria Wiki</a>. Any new shared universe series will likewise be placed on this page. (Separate links to these series are still in the fanfic listings, only now they jump directly to the appropriate sections on this page instead of linking to their own pages.)<br>

      <b>June 8:</b> Those of you who are lucky enough to live in or near New York City, take note: Anne D. Bernstein, writer of <u>The Daria Diaries</u> and such notable episodes as <a href="ep111.html">"Road Worrier" (#111)</a> and <a href="ep308.html">"Lane Miserables" (#308)</a>, will be teaching an animation writing class this summer at the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art (MOCCA). Check the details at the <a href="news.html"><i>Daria</i> News Desk</a>; if you're interested, and if you can afford the cost of the class, it sounds like a lot of fun!<br>
      <br>
      <i>Daria: The Complete Animated Series</i> is apparently selling like hotcakes -- it was on Amazon's hot seller list, and reportedly sold out its initial shipment very quickly -- and is getting uniformly positive reviews from many sites (most reviews cite the music licensing issue as a disappointment, though ultimately not a critical factor).

      <b>May 11:</b> The <i>Daria: The Complete Animated Series</i> DVD box set is now available from both online and brick-and-mortar retailers!<br>
      <br>
      On the website front: I'm in the process (one that's long overdue) of overhauling things around here. Nothing drastic yet, but I've begun the process of altering pages to use 800-pixel tables instead of 600-pixel. After all, it's 2010, and by now I figure that very, very few people still operate systems with a screen resolution under 1024x768 (particularly with widescreen LED monitors having essentially taken over the market). This should give me more breathing room in future page creation, short of a total overhaul of the design of Outpost Daria (which I haven't ruled out).<br>
      <br>
      Still working on the artwork (mentioned in last month's late update). I wanted to get the news of the DVD release out ASAP.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, May 10th was my birthday! Yay, I've been on this Earth for 44 years! (Wait... why the hell am I so cheerful about <i>that</i>...?)<br>

So far, only episodes from S1 to S3 are available, and all indications are that these episodes are the ones that will be appearing on the <i>Daria</i> DVD set due to be released on May 11 (translation: no original music).

This quick update has but one purpose: to revamp the <a href="daria_on_dvd.html">Daria on DVD</a> page with information on all current and upcoming DVD releases, with links to order them at various sites. I'll have another update out later this month with the usual goodies (fanfic, etc.). Enjoy!<br>

      Aside from that, Valentine's Day is this month, so why not head on over to the fanfic section and get in the mood with some <a href="fanfic_topic_romance.html">shippery romance goodness</a>? (And if anyone has a better and more appropriate alter-ego for February, I'm open to suggestions, because that DeMartino picture is bound to give someone nightmares...)<br>

      Welcome to 2010, and a new decade (unless you're one of those weirdos who counts their decades starting from 1, in which case you're lost and I can't help you). Just a couple of stories this time around to whet your appetites and cure your post-New Year hangovers. Enjoy!<br>
      <br>
      <b>LATE-BREAKING NEWS:</b> The MTV website now has a <a href="http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/470805/daria-dvd-teaser.jhtml#id=1629610" target="_blank">teaser trailer for the upcoming <i>Daria</i> DVD release</a> on its website. No real information beyond what we already know ("Coming in 2010"), but it's nice to have further confirmation that it's actually, <i>finally</i> happening. (Thanks to <i>Daria</i> fan Spencer for the link!)<br>
